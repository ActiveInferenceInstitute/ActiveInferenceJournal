00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,513
KNIGHT: Welcome to the Active

20
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,948
Inference Institute.

30
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,483
This is a participatory

40
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,118
online laboratory.

50
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,254
Today is Tuesday, September 13th,

60
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,257
and we are here with MathStream #004.1

70
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,326
with David Spivak

80
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,162
and we are welcome to take any questions

90
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,130
in the YouTube chat.

100
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,297
So if you have any questions,

110
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,165
please write from there

120
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,933
and we will have time to

130
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:34,801
ask our presenter

140
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,203
during the course of this discussion.

150
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,272
KNIGHT: David is here to talk to us today

160
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,907
about dynamic interfaces

170
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:41,708
and arrangements

180
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,475
and algebraic

190
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,811
frameworks for interacting systems.

200
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,946
Please take it away.

210
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,647
SPIVAK: Okay. Yeah.

220
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,482
Thanks a lot for having me.

230
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,052
So I am going to talk for around

240
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,652
40 minutes,

250
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,487
but for maybe almost an hour,

260
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,288
I don't know.

70
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,958
But feel free to interrupt

280
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,592
with whatever.

290
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,927
And I wanted to say at the outset

300
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,829
that I'm not really talking much

310
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,965
about active inference itself here.

320
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:06,933
I'm mainly saying

330
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,201
like another perspective

340
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,670
on interacting systems or systems

350
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,639
that might learn or something like that.

360
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,306
SPIVAK: And I'm

370
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,974
more like waiting for the discussion

380
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,110
time to kind of find these links.

390
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,779
So yeah. Okay.

400
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,581
So I want to talk about

410
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,249
dynamic interfaces and arrangements

420
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,150
and what that means

430
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,386
and this applied category theory

440
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,321
point of view on things.

450
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,824
So, so why am I here?

460
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,193
I'm here to seek

470
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,894
a valuable exchange of ideas

480
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,030
because active inference offers

490
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,531
the first time I heard about it.

500
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,466
SPIVAK: It's compelling,

510
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,033
and most people

520
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,901
apparently find it unusual,

530
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,936
but for some reason

540
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,270
it instantly meshed

550
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,106
with my own intuition about things

560
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:46,773
that I've gotten from

570
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,208
applied category theory.

580
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,576
And so I think there's a lot

590
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,978
we can learn from each other.

600
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,813
So applied category

610
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,448
theory emphasizes structure

620
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,550
rather than quantitative analysis.

630
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,685
So most of math and science

640
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,453
today reduce all of our experience

650
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,788
to plays of quantity.

660
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,190
SPIVAK: So you have graphs and you have numbers

670
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,260
and you measure things in numbers

680
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,561
and you have probabilities

690
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,829
and those are numbers.

700
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,131
And so everything is just a number

710
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,198
but experience.

720
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:12,999
What's happening now?

730
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,201
I mean, what number would you put on?

740
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,070
You know, the sound of my voice or the

750
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,770
or what numbers?

760
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,173
You could put numbers on this slide,

770
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,107
but would they tell you

780
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,742
what the slide was about?

790
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,512
SPIVAK: And so what category theory emphasizes?

800
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,179
It's still math,

810
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,847
but it emphasizes structure.

820
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,383
It emphasizes relations between things

830
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,351
like the relationship

840
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,719
between what's on this slide

850
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,053
and other things on the slide

860
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,488
or what's on the rest of the talk,

870
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,122
the relationships

880
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,423
between that and meta relationship

890
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,525
between that and you,

900
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,893
and the kind of coherence

910
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,527
between all that.

920
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,761
Like, why are we really here?

930
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,030
SPIVAK: What is it? How does it cohere?

940
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,265
How does it come together?

950
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,232
So Applied Category

960
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,867
Theory aims to bring that math

970
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,269
to relational disciplines

980
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,938
outside of math.

990
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,972
So I want to tell you about applied

1000
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,240
category theory

1010
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,109
specifically in reference to interfaces,

1020
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,277
because I'm going to say

1030
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,412
that we interact through our interfaces.

1040
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,413
When you hear the word interface,

1050
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,015
you might think markup, blanket.

1060
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,216
SPIVAK: I don't know enough

1070
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:03,983
to be sure that

1080
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,385
that's exactly what I mean.

1090
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,053
So that's kind of where this is fitting

1100
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,454
in, maybe into an active

1110
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,389
inference framing,

1120
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,156
but I'd rather

1130
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,658
you just think about interfaces.

1140
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,459
So I'm

1150
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,160
asking you this

1160
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,395
talk what sort of algebra

1170
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,764
could support us in thinking about

1180
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,834
interaction and stuff like that?

1190
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,335
I think of

1200
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,369
mathematical fields

1210
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,539
as accounting systems, so I like that

1220
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,707
the word count is in there

1230
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,243
and I like how kind of humble it is.

1240
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,178
SPIVAK: It's like an accounting system here.

1250
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,581
So if you want to

1260
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,615
if you have arithmetic,

1270
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,150
that's a mathematical field

1280
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,817
and it accounts

1290
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,952
for the flow of quantities

1300
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,221
like in finance.

1310
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,822
So if you want your accountant

1320
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,223
to help

1330
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,458
you say why you did what you did

1340
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,559
or what you did

1350
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,394
and how the quantities flowed,

1360
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,530
you would write something in

1370
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,598
an arithmetic account,

1380
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,933
you write an arithmetic account of it,

1390
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,201
and then someone could point that

1400
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,470
and say, What's this, $12.83?

1410
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,738
SPIVAK: And you could explain.

1420
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,906
So there is numbers

1430
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,907
and you can account for stuff.

1440
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:02,642
What if you

1450
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,343
wanted to account

1460
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,579
for the teleportation protocol

1470
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,680
of quantum mechanics

1480
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,749
or something like that?

1490
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,684
So Hilbert Spaces is a

1500
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,652
is a branch of math,

1510
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,086
and it helps

1520
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,886
you make accounts

1530
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,255
for the sorts of things

1540
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,089
that people do

1550
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,223
in quantum computing

1560
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,993
or quantum mechanics or generally.

1570
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,060
Probability distributions

1580
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,028
is a mathematical field,

1590
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,297
but it helps to account for likelihoods.

1600
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,798
Why somebody winning in poker?

1610
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,166
Somebody not

1620
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,102
if you want to give that account

1630
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,303
and you want to be careful about it,

1640
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,040
you do use probability distributions.

1650
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,242
So but what is it? A counter phenomena?

1660
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,111
Like we're already kind of talking

1670
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,012
and you know,

1680
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,546
somebody might give an account

1690
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,948
of their finances or something

1700
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,217
and just written in English,

1710
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,752
but you can't really be that careful

1720
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,820
with that. You can't track it.

1730
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,655
You can't be sure

1740
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,555
you know what they're saying,

1750
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,224
that you can point at something.

1760
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,759
So the language,

1770
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,593
the accounting system

1780
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,661
has to articulate

1790
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,495
the relevant type

1800
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,930
differences and provide operations

1810
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,432
that correspond with their interactions.

1820
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,501
And that's really a dumb statement.

1830
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,201
I didn't mean to

1840
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,903
I'm trying to keep things concise,

1850
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,504
but what do I mean?

1860
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,173
SPIVAK: They're in accounting for dollars

1870
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,108
and like financial stuff,

1880
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:09,976
there is dollars

1890
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,544
and there's numbers of things

1900
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,713
and you can add and subtract dollars

1910
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,049
like this was $5 and he paid four.

1920
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,016
So there's $1 left.

1930
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,851
So you can subtract them or add them,

1940
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,753
but you can't multiply $2 figures.

1950
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,622
It doesn't mean anything to multiply $5

1960
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,956
times $8,

1970
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,491
but you can multiply $5

1980
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,859
by eight things like.

1990
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,029
SPIVAK: So I sold eight things of $5 each.

2000
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,531
So the operations

2010
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,465
that you're allowed to do

2020
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,201
there are different type difference.

2030
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,536
There's the number of widgets

2040
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,003
and then there's

2050
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,904
the price of the widgets.

2060
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,605
And that's a difference in type.

2070
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,374
And the operations make sense with

2080
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,376
plus you're allowed to add dollars

2090
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,844
and allowed to add numbers of widgets,

2100
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,146
but you're not allowed to multiply

2110
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,815
numbers of dollars

2120
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,717
by numbers of dollars.

2130
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,085
SPIVAK: So that's kind of what I mean here.

2140
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,554
An accounting system needs to tell you,

2150
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,621
hey, that's not a dollar.

2160
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,055
It means

2170
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,390
what would it even mean

2180
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,159
to multiply $5 by $8?

2190
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:00,893
Is it in dollars

2200
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,161
squared now or something anyway?

2210
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,296
So that's the sort of thing

2220
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,764
that the accounting system does.

2230
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,632
It gives you

2240
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,134
a way of knowing

2250
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,302
what you're allowed to do,

2260
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,503
what the type differences are,

2270
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,371
and what you can operate,

2280
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,538
how you operate on them.

2290
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,307
SPIVAK: So if every mathematical field

2300
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,174
is an accounting system,

2310
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,075
the category theory

2320
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,009
is an accounting system.

2330
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,978
So what is it accounting system for?

2340
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,979
It's an accounting system

2350
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,914
for the fact that we see in the world

2360
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,316
coherent structures,

2370
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,751
we see in the world, flows of things

2380
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,385
we see in the world,

2390
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,052
quantum mechanics

2400
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,487
we see in the world, likelihoods

2410
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,521
and we see in the world

2420
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,422
coherent structures.

2430
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,556
SPIVAK: So if we want to account for them,

2440
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,858
we need some language.

2450
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,625
And the one that's been

2460
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,993
invented is category theory.

2470
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:35,461
And so

2480
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,562
it makes analogies

2490
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,131
which are similarities of structure

2500
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,433
with different content.

2510
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,434
I've got one thing

2520
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,603
and another thing is to be is to deep.

2530
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,405
That similarity

2540
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,540
is made into a formal object

2550
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,141
and category

2560
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,842
theory's been useful in math or computer

2570
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,676
science, physics

2580
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,513
or material science linguistics.

2590
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,147
SPIVAK: And moreover,

2600
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,181
one thing I didn't see on a slide

2610
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,582
is that category theory helps

2620
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,684
you invent new mathematical fields.

2630
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,986
They might not be big ones

2640
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,621
that are studied by a million people.

2650
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,524
You might just have a micro custom built

2660
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,392
accounting system

2670
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,294
written in category theory.

2680
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,730
So you make a new system of structure.

2690
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,031
And what I'm interested in is

2700
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,533
what sort of system,

2710
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,434
accounting system,

2720
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,268
what could we use

2730
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,670
to account for dynamic interaction,

2740
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,072
like things interacting?

2750
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,707
SPIVAK: So the driving question,

2760
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,676
I really prefer to have a

2770
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,244
question that I can always be asking

2780
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,712
instead of one that I need

2790
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,915
very specific lab to do.

2800
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,149
So I want to know what we have

2810
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,284
right here.

2820
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,418
I want to account

2830
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,453
for this incredible world

2840
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,854
that we have, because on earth

2850
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,556
we have all these amazing forms of life

2860
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,591
from cells to humans.

2870
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,226
SPIVAK: How did that come about?

2880
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,394
And we have the built world

2890
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,062
where we have transportation systems

2900
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,896
and things like that

2910
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,031
and we have computers.

2920
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,066
It's an amazing built world.

2930
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,101
We have language, the ability

2940
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,303
to systematically present

2950
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,771
knowledge like a slideshow

2960
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,673
or a history book or whatever.

2970
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,142
We have morality with rules of thumb

2980
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,176
for living a good life.

2990
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,377
How did that come about?

3000
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,912
SPIVAK: I think in each of these cases,

3010
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,381
they evolved through the push and pull

3020
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,816
and struggle of living.

3030
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,220
So language is refined by continually

3040
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,120
using language

3050
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,922
and the way we present knowledge

3060
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,390
or the built world,

3070
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,060
the way we architect things,

3080
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,695
is continually evolving.

3090
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,163
And even morality.

3100
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,631
Like you have a bunch of societies

3110
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,799
that have to live together

3120
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,901
and they evolve a way to do that.

3130
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,070
SPIVAK: So I want to see see all that.

3140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,805
I want to account for that.

3150
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,374
So what are these systems and

3160
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,408
how do they develop

3170
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,210
and how do we talk about them

3180
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,012
all at once?

3190
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,080
What language

3200
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,847
is appropriate

3210
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,615
for giving accounts

3220
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,384
of this happening in action?

3230
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,585
And can we use that language

3240
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,254
to engineer new systems?

3250
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,522
And then something we were talking about

3260
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,489
just before we started

3270
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:43,789
the talk

3280
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,491
today is like what constitute health

3290
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,459
or wisdom?

3300
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,426
SPIVAK: What gives the system

3310
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,294
a sense of direction,

3320
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,161
and how come it keeps

3330
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,763
finding good senses of direction

3340
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,199
in the sense that evolution,

3350
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:53,733
somehow

3360
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,867
our civilization

3370
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,503
is offering more today than it did

3380
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,842
in the past.

3390
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,343
So the only part of this

3400
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,278
I'm going to discuss

3410
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,812
is the potential accounting system

3420
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,713
that I'm offering here

3430
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,348
or like the beginning of it.

3440
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,218
SPIVAK: So in other words, I don't know how

3450
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,719
all this stuff happened.

3460
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,520
I just

3470
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,354
I don't want to be the one

3480
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:15,721
to figure out

3490
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,323
how all this stuff happened because it's

3500
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,925
obviously it's more than even

3510
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:20,493
then, you

3520
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,627
know, any group of people

3530
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,762
could really finish

3540
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,362
or even

3550
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,263
and I don't

3560
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,265
even have the capacity to really start,

3570
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,402
but I think there are many people who do

3580
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,003
and already are doing that.

3590
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,772
SPIVAK: And what I'm trying to offer is a way

3600
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,539
we could put that

3610
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,810
into some sort of accounting system.

3620
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,477
Okay.

3630
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,347
So this this thing that we're doing

3640
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,015
now is the subject of a talk.

3650
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,784
It's dynamic interaction,

3660
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,752
morphology, the way that things form

3670
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,987
like us institute

3680
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,056
formed or a person forms

3690
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,291
and behavior.

3700
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,260
All that stuff is about little systems

3710
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,328
that interact.

3720
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,295
SPIVAK: And this interaction

3730
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,531
structure itself changes through time.

3740
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,600
And I'll explain a mathematical language

3750
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,368
for working with that sort of thing.

3760
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,169
But on some level,

3770
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:03,903
much of this talk

3780
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,172
will be a case of its own subject matter

3790
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,807
in the sense that

3800
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,041
I'm interested in the development

3810
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,543
of life's order,

3820
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,345
like what is how does this develop?

3830
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,613
But in the science system,

3840
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,082
this takes place between the

3850
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,617
interaction between fields.

3860
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,185
SPIVAK: So right now

3870
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,020
you guys know much more

3880
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,088
about active inference

3890
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,889
and I know more about category theory.

3900
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,124
And so we're participating

3910
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,759
in this science system

3920
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,194
where we're interacting

3930
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,729
and we're having dynamic interaction,

3940
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,964
because after this,

3950
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,532
the part where I'm just talking,

3960
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,701
I'm still looking at Bleu as she's

3970
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,902
she's looking at me

3980
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:37,937
and I'm seeing her nod

3990
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,672
and that that helps me decide

4000
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,907
what to say next and whether we're where

4010
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,976
how this communication is working.

4020
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,112
SPIVAK: So we're experiencing the development,

4030
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,780
the ability for systems

4040
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,782
interacting to shape,

4050
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,051
shape that interaction and become

4060
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,754
like sense, make it together

4070
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,555
in real time here.

4080
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,457
So

4090
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,394
the concepts

4100
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,495
discussed in this talk

4110
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,263
should describe the talk itself

4120
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,131
as an interaction.

4130
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,400
So let me just pause for a feedback

4140
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,535
and just kind of get someone else's

4150
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,537
voice into the space if you're willing.

4160
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,405
SPIVAK: Do you see like

4170
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,172
kind of what I'm saying

4180
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
that the math I'm doing,

4190
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm talking about here

4200
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,142
should be capable.

4210
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm not going to give the description

4220
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,411
because I'd would be like

4230
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,478
filling out the spreadsheet

4240
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,613
with all the facts.

4250
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,414
But it's more like that.

4260
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,014
The math

4270
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,582
could offer the sort of spreadsheet

4280
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,717
you would need to talk about

4290
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,384
this sort of thing.

4300
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,521
KNIGHT: So definitely like math

4310
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,488
related to

4320
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,057
interaction is really

4330
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,124
what activity

4340
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,528
is all about and fundamentally describes

4350
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,231
sense of perception and action.

4360
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,633
Daniel joined us for a minute.

4370
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,001
Do you have any extra comments?

4380
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,269
I have a feeling of something

4390
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,236
to say here.

4400
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,104
No.

4410
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,841
FRIEDMAN: I would just ask, what can math describe

4420
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,111
and where do our science

4430
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,480
and other things that are not math

4440
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,614
also play roles?

4450
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,750
How do those interact?

4460
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,084
SPIVAK: Great.

4470
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,020
Yeah, cool.

4480
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,488
So

4490
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,890
I'm suggesting that math gives you

4500
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,025
the accounting system

4510
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,360
and that science fills it in.

4520
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,096
But let me.

4530
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,164
Yeah, yeah.

4540
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,232
So I think I'm going to go into that

4550
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:13,966
a little more.

4560
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,101
But so there's

4570
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,368
this self-reflective character

4580
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,270
where I'm saying that

4590
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,804
you guys

4600
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,473
just actually participated

4610
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,308
in an interaction with me

4620
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,042
and like

4630
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,610
gave a kind of sense of direction

4640
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,580
for this talk a little bit, or at least

4650
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,081
one thing

4660
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,616
we want to discuss, which is what's

4670
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,251
what's the role of math and science.

4680
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,521
SPIVAK: And so we're kind of created co-creating

4690
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,189
this sense,

4700
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,824
making work that we're doing here

4710
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,792
through our interaction.

4720
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,227
And so that's kind of what I'm saying,

4730
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:41,694
is that there's

4740
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,695
this self-reflective thing

4750
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,896
that the talk itself,

4760
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:44,563
if you want to,

4770
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,364
you can always dove

4780
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,534
into this itself as a case.

4790
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,635
So that's kind of hanging around.

4800
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,436
But I'm not going to push

4810
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,570
really into that.

4820
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:51,971
SPIVAK: The fact

4830
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:52,505
SPIVAK: that we're building

4840
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,141
something together here too much more,

4850
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,308
but it's here.

4860
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,877
So

4870
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,646
I want to talk about how theory

4880
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,848
compresses and information,

4890
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,183
and then there's elaboration

4900
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,385
and there's feedback from experiment.

4910
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,953
So I think that the compression

4920
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,654
and elaboration

4930
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,556
play a big role in the story.

4940
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,791
We compress our past

4950
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,358
into a form

4960
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,226
that we elaborate in the present,

4970
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,228
so we're constantly forming memories

4980
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,563
that are not as big

4990
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,365
as the thing that they're memory up,

5000
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,133
but they're compressions that we can

5010
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,134
SPIVAK: elaborate on. The present

5020
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,204
DNA, for example, compresses,

5030
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,238
record of who died

5040
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,007
and who thrived in some sense

5050
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,242
into language or for nucleotides

5060
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,278
and theory,

5070
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,546
any theory of the compression

5080
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,413
of past experience.

5090
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,482
So the free energy principle is

5100
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,685
someone has compressed ideas about what

5110
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,653
they've seen over and over

5120
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,088
and over again into a very small form.

5130
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,623
And then

5140
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,157
whether you're talking

5150
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,992
about DNA or memories

5160
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
or the free energy principle,

5170
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,563
these are elaborated in the present.

5180
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,231
SPIVAK: So as I speak, this theory

5190
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,766
about compression or whatever,

5200
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,136
not very original, but it's here

5210
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,771
that is an elaboration

5220
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,071
of something

5230
00:13:59,071 --> 00:13:59,772
that compressed

5240
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,440
into these slides in the past

5250
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,008
where DNA is

5260
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,778
somehow read by messenger RNA.

5270
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,846
And I don't know, there's

5280
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,980
a ribosome involved

5290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,648
and stuff and it's elaborated.

5300
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,684
Those genes are producing proteins

5310
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,986
and those proteins are elaborated to

5320
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,756
the elaboration of that compressed code,

5330
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,124
and they then

5340
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,126
create a living form of the thing.

5350
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,229
SPIVAK: So that seems really important.

5360
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,931
And then similarly experiment in theory.

5370
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,333
If theory is like compression

5380
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,033
and experiments

5390
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,235
like elaboration,

5400
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:29,902
these exist

5410
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,970
both in biological

5420
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,371
and mathematical fields.

5430
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,607
So almost everyone knows

5440
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,041
everyone who knows a biology is know

5450
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,643
that there experiments involved.

5460
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,544
And maybe you wouldn't think

5470
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,246
that math has experimentation,

5480
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,313
and I think that it does.

5490
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,114
But it's the attempt

5500
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,149
to articulate and compute things

5510
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,084
that tell you that's

5520
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,185
how you are elaborated.

5530
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,420
SPIVAK: You talk about things and you compute

5540
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,155
and we value formalism

5550
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,590
if it makes expression

5560
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,125
and computation easy.

5570
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,093
So that's the experiment.

5580
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,561
Like how good is this thing?

5590
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,161
Well, does

5600
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,496
it make it easy to say what I want

5610
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,198
and does it make it easy to compute?

5620
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,933
So with Roman numerals here, like

5630
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,701
I don't think this is very good

5640
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,303
at expressing,

5650
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,205
but I know it's really bad in computing.

5660
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,240
SPIVAK: So if you want to multiply this

5670
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,942
Roman numeral by this Roman numeral,

5680
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,010
you're just kind of screwed.

5690
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,445
There is no procedure.

5700
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,580
You can go through.

5710
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,681
The only procedure I know

5720
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,515
is to translate them

5730
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,350
into Hindi, Arabic numerals

5740
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,085
14 and six, for example,

5750
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,420
and then use what

5760
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,187
these are built for,

5770
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,423
which is using the distributive law.

5780
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,260
So 14 is ten plus four and ten times

5790
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,562
six is easy and four times six is easy.

5800
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,631
SPIVAK: So you get 84

5810
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,867
and so you translate it back into six.

5820
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,468
But where that came from

5830
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,903
or why there are three axes

5840
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,439
you'll never figure out it's just 84.

5850
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,775
So the Hindi Arabic numerals,

5860
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,576
I'm saying, are empirically better.

5870
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,445
Like they just win games, right?

5880
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,980
Like Fibonacci

5890
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,214
not only came up with the one one,

5900
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,650
two, three, five eight sequence,

5910
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,919
but probably more importantly,

5920
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,088
it was the one who brought the Hindi

5930
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:56,956
SPIVAK: Arabic numerals.

5940
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,290
SPIVAK: So the Hindus

5950
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,491
apparently invented them in.

5960
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,926
The Arabs saved them for a long time,

5970
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,328
and then Fibonacci found them,

5980
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,229
brought them to to the West

5990
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,631
and they're just better.

6000
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,999
They just weren't.

6010
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,634
They just won out.

6020
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,535
And that's the way that

6030
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,869
experiment exists in math.

6040
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,273
How easy it is to use.

6050
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,240
And that's the sort of value

6060
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,541
claim I'm

6070
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,576
making about what I'm discussing today,

6080
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,844
that it's it's a single

6090
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,012
accounting system.

6100
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,347
SPIVAK: You're not constantly changing what

6110
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,849
the notation means or

6120
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,484
changing

6130
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,752
how you're thinking about things.

6140
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,921
It's all one system,

6150
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,255
and it just works

6160
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,992
really well with itself.

6170
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,193
So the plan for the talk is that

6180
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,196
it will be in for four parts.

6190
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,130
I'll give you a presently

6200
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,831
available case.

6210
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,232
The thing I'm trying to model,

6220
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,033
I'll give a whirlwind

6230
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:41,567
tour of what

6240
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,235
the math actually looks like.

6250
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,403
SPIVAK: I'll talk about some existing

6260
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,871
applications and open questions,

6270
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,676
and then I'll conclude with a summary.

6280
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,110
Okay,

6290
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,978
so the current dynamic arrangement,

6300
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,046
so this Zoom call

6310
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:54,947
that we're having right now

6320
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,149
and maybe with the YouTube livestream

6330
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,150
and the people on the chat

6340
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,285
and Cetera is a dynamic arrangement.

6350
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,221
So how do we think about it?

6360
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,823
I want to break it into three structures

6370
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,925
interfaces, dynamics and interaction.

6380
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,627
SPIVAK: So I'm going to have like

6390
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,629
I think overall six keywords

6400
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,031
and these are three of them and I'm

6410
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,265
sorry there's so many, but they

6420
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,633
all are different.

6430
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,503
So

6440
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,405
each one of us has an interface.

6450
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,707
So it's what I can express and take it.

6460
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,609
I'm expressing through the changes

6470
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,877
of my vocal chords

6480
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,278
and the movement of my hands.

6490
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,546
And I'm taking in information

6500
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,381
through the sensations

6510
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,950
in my body and my eyes and my ears.

6520
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,019
SPIVAK: And then each one of us has dynamics.

6530
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,621
So I have some internal state

6540
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,457
that you can't see exactly,

6550
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,324
but I'm in it

6560
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,727
in some mood and I'm expecting to read

6570
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,694
and all that sort of stuff.

6580
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,662
And then that's updated

6590
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,097
by what I see

6600
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,166
you guys doing or

6610
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,867
what I'm reading on the screen.

6620
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,902
And then between us

6630
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,836
there's interaction,

6640
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,772
which is how my output, my expression

6650
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:54,873
affects you,

6660
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,842
how your expression affects me.

6670
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,478
SPIVAK: So those are what I think is going on.

6680
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,245
A lot of what's going on

6690
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,780
in this dynamic arrangement between us,

6700
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:03,649
it's it's

6710
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,216
really useful

6720
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,684
to draw boundaries around things.

6730
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,986
So you modularized by nesting

6740
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,755
reference frames

6750
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,957
we have little reference frames.

6760
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,691
I mean by that

6770
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,460
I don't necessarily mean the thing

6780
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,795
they mean in relativity theory,

6790
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,030
although I think that would be a case.

6800
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,530
SPIVAK: A reference

6810
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,965
SPIVAK: frame is just a

6820
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,267
a box you put around things and you say,

6830
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,703
I can refer to this as Alice

6840
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,205
and this is Bob and stuff like that.

6850
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,573
I want a frame

6860
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,041
where I get to have a notation

6870
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,143
or a way to refer to things,

6880
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,544
and we have littler systems

6890
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,580
interacting within bigger systems

6900
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,349
all the time.

6910
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,152
We could say that atom, with its

6920
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,622
electron

6930
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,592
orbitals or whatever is some kind of

6940
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,827
reference frame or so.

6950
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,761
SPIVAK: But atoms

6960
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,429
and molecules

6970
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,363
we could think of the molecules

6980
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,398
of reference frame for all of its atoms.

6990
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,134
You can point to them and refer to them.

7000
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,969
Organizations and societies.

7010
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,936
We modularized

7020
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,904
and we say, that's the thing,

7030
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,239
that's the thing, that's the thing.

7040
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,040
And we are putting things together

7050
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,443
and that's useful in evolution.

7060
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,145
So for example,

7070
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,546
according to Herbert Simon,

7080
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,314
like that's how evolution is so fast

7090
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:09,781
is because it

7100
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,284
modularized is our liver and our stomach

7110
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,052
and let them evolve independently

7120
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,955
but also

7130
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,790
or various systems,

7140
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,026
circulatory or nervous system, etc..

7150
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,161
SPIVAK: But also

7160
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,028
it's useful in the way

7170
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,198
we think humans think about things.

7180
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,599
I want to emphasize again

7190
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,200
that the math here

7200
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,201
will not be numerical,

7210
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,102
it will be structural.

7220
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,303
So as we move into the math,

7230
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,437
you'll see how it manages

7240
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,906
these reference frames.

7250
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,175
And so like geometry is about shapes.

7260
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,344
Geometry doesn't have much number in it,

7270
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,879
but there are numbers a little bit.

7280
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,247
SPIVAK: There is like how big the angle is

7290
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,549
and how big the sides are,

7300
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,750
but it's really about the shapes

7310
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,584
and the congruent spins

7320
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,752
and stuff like that.

7330
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,520
And similarly you can put it,

7340
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,254
you can put numbers

7350
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,022
into category theory,

7360
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,223
it accepts that,

7370
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,591
but it's really about the structure

7380
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,926
of why you're using those numbers

7390
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,960
and which numbers can

7400
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,962
be added to other numbers or what

7410
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,730
the rules are about the numbers.

7420
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,032
SPIVAK: And really you don't need numbers

7430
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,499
at all.

7440
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,800
The relationships that are happening

7450
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,804
here, for example, are not numerical.

7460
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,905
But before we get there,

7470
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,773
let's make sure we understand

7480
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,008
our principal subject, because

7490
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,211
we'd like this math to

7500
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,111
be able to describe things

7510
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,113
we work with, like cells or tadpoles

7520
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,449
or us or institutes or whatever.

7530
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,420
And I'll define what I mean

7540
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,456
by interface as a mathematical object.

7550
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,657
SPIVAK: But I want to ground this

7560
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,425
talk in something

7570
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,559
we can all think about together.

7580
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,694
And since we don't have cells

7590
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,296
or tadpoles here, we're the subject.

7600
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,866
So this, this, this zoom call, let's say

7610
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,602
with a library and all

7620
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,903
that is the subject.

7630
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,605
How do we think about ourselves?

7640
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,072
Well, each

7650
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,872
one of us can do

7660
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,506
certain things

7670
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,042
and receive certain things. Okay.

7680
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,144
So I can move and listen.

7690
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,613
We each outwardly express

7700
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,182
and take in what we what we do there

7710
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,951
with what I'm calling our interfaces.

7720
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,019
I said before,

7730
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,954
and I'm going to call these things,

7740
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:56,822
the blue will always

7750
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,590
be the things we can do.

7760
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,959
So it's like the positions of my body

7770
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,828
and the green will be what I can take

7780
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,829
in, kind of like what

7790
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,431
force the forces that act on me or

7800
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,000
the sensorium. I have

7810
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,702
that act on me.

7820
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,770
So any expression,

7830
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,472
whether it's a sound or attitude,

7840
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,673
is a kind of position.

7850
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,274
It's a position

7860
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,876
I'm taking in kind of popular parlance

7870
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:18,710
or whatever.

7880
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,279
Someone's expressing themselves

7890
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,346
or taking a position.

7900
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,247
But you could also imagine

7910
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,182
the position of my vocal cords

7920
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:24,883
moving around

7930
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,518
and that that movement of position

7940
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,753
is an expression

7950
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,855
that comes out of sound.

7960
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,690
SPIVAK: Your inner states are reflected

7970
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,625
outwardly as these positions.

7980
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,126
It's happening

7990
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,460
maybe faster than you can recognize

8000
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,029
in the case of vocal cords.

8010
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,131
But it's still an expression

8020
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,667
using the blue positions,

8030
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,201
the outward expression,

8040
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,636
and then the world impinges on you

8050
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,405
or in me, and it directs me

8060
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,606
and it moves me by forces.

8070
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,341
So when I see,

8080
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,342
you know,

8090
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,810
there could be literal forces on me

8100
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,678
or you could just say,

8110
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,780
Hey, would you mind passing the salt?

8120
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,581
SPIVAK: And that impinges on me.

8130
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,050
It directs me to pass the salt

8140
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,950
that moves me.

8150
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,851
Maybe I don't do it,

8160
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,819
but at least it changes

8170
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,987
my internal state to being

8180
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,489
being stubborn or

8190
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,492
something or to being helpful.

8200
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,161
So what your body can receive

8210
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,928
in a moment.

8220
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,929
This is a kind of weird one.

8230
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,264
I'm not going to emphasize it

8240
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,266
that much, especially later.

8250
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,901
SPIVAK: But it's true.

8260
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,669
I think that what your body can receive

8270
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,571
in a moment depends on its position.

8280
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,839
So when your eyes are open,

8290
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,540
that type of thing

8300
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,174
you can get in through

8310
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,142
your eyes is bigger

8320
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,677
than when your eyes are closed

8330
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,612
so more can act on you.

8340
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,447
If I close my eyes,

8350
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,481
I just don't know what you're

8360
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,016
what you're doing.

8370
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,417
SPIVAK: And when your car goes through a tunnel,

8380
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,653
the GPS stops receiving.

8390
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,289
And when you unplug your monitor

8400
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,624
from your computer, it's no longer

8410
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,560
or your keyboard

8420
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,961
is no longer receiving things.

8430
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,230
So the position can affect

8440
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:46,865
what it can receive.

8450
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,967
The monitor is no longer

8460
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,035
receiving from the computer

8470
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,403
if you disconnect.

8480
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,906
SPIVAK: So the story so far is that you output

8490
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,043
blue positions and you value E

8500
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,912
and you input forces.

8510
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:06,051
And so the force or sensation

8520
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,986
or input that you receive changes

8530
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,654
your internal state.

8540
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,223
And then your state is reflected

8550
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,491
outwardly as a new position.

8560
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,325
I move my eyes

8570
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,427
or my head or my voice box

8580
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,928
and a new sensor,

8590
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,797
and then if I close my eyes, open

8600
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,898
my eyes, I have this.

8610
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,266
SPIVAK: Whatever happens,

8620
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,768
it may be the same

8630
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,669
space of sensations or different,

8640
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,705
but I see new sensations

8650
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,141
and those change my internal state, etc.

8660
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:29,741
etc.

8670
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,542
So this is repeat

8680
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,710
loops repeatedly,

8690
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,512
either discretely if you want to model

8700
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,880
it that way or continuously.

8710
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:36,548
But then

8720
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,683
where do these forces inputs come from?

8730
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,852
They come from this interaction.

8740
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,554
So the way that we're arranged

8750
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,322
here, we're calling in an arrangement

8760
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,291
and that's going to be another key word.

8770
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,826
SPIVAK: Zoom arranges it.

8780
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,896
So that my outputs get to you as inputs

8790
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:51,963
so you can hear me.

8800
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,498
And if you,

8810
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,266
as you receive

8820
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,134
what I say, your body shifts

8830
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,135
and that's your output.

8840
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,070
And that comes to me.

8850
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,106
So the way this works

8860
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,240
is based on the arrangement

8870
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,074
that we're calling Zoom.

8880
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,277
And so now we have another color orange

8890
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,344
and the program arranges

8900
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,613
it so we can input each other's outputs

8910
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,382
and our interaction with the program

8920
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,350
and change the arrangement itself.

8930
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,252
SPIVAK: So if Daniel wanted to,

8940
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,588
he could spotlight me or mute me

8950
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,291
or change how the information is passed.

8960
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,159
And so

8970
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,061
the very things that you're doing,

8980
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,097
the outputs that Daniel is doing or me,

8990
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,466
I could ask him to do that

9000
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,700
or I could be myself.

9010
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,502
The part of our outputs

9020
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,236
have the ability

9030
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,472
to change the arrangement between us.

9040
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,640
SPIVAK: We can walk away or whatever.

9050
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,942
You don't have to actually hear me.

9060
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,976
I don't know why you're smiling,

9070
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,610
but I'm imagining

9080
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,481
you doing some practical joke.

9090
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,549
Okay, so I'm going to move into the

9100
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,854
math now.

9110
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,221
Yeah.

9120
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:50,789
Okay.

9130
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,757
So this algebraic theory of interfaces

9140
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,692
and arrangements,

9150
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,793
there's a bunch of words

9160
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,861
we're going to use,

9170
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,795
and here are the six,

9180
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,863
I think one, two, three,

9190
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,499
four or 507 interfaces

9200
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,334
switching positions,

9210
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,502
forces, states,

9220
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,470
arrangements, enclosures, nothing.

9230
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,171
SPIVAK: I don't think I've said

9240
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,539
all of them so far,

9250
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,074
but they shouldn't be too bad

9260
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,541
at this point.

9270
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,009
So we each have an interface.

9280
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,943
It's what we can.

9290
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,712
It's that through which we interact,

9300
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,479
our interfaces

9310
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,213
allows ourselves

9320
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,414
to express ourselves

9330
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,183
outward to our position.

9340
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,084
And given a position,

9350
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:19,618
our interface

9360
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,585
allows us to receive

9370
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,088
certain forces or sensations.

9380
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,457
Our state is changed by the

9390
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,259
by the received force,

9400
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,293
and then our state

9410
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,228
is expressed as a position.

9420
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,329
SPIVAK: So we're state changes

9430
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,063
based on what we see,

9440
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,331
and then we express it

9450
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,266
and then multiple

9460
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,234
interfaces interact together

9470
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,702
via their current arrangement.

9480
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,905
How we're arranged together

9490
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,473
doesn't have to be spatial arrangement.

9500
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,741
We are the three of us

9510
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,210
here on the zoom call are arranged.

9520
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,411
I guess, in space.

9530
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,046
But really more importantly in terms

9540
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,248
of how Zoom wants to arrange us

9550
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,350
and we also interact with our enclosure,

9560
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,251
which is the thing

9570
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,086
outside is another interface.

9580
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,588
SPIVAK: And these arrangements can be nested

9590
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,188
hierarchically.

9600
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,490
So here's a picture

9610
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,758
and it's kind of schematic.

9620
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,992
It's not supposed to be

9630
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,193
what we really are,

9640
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,829
but every box here is an interface.

9650
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,198
So I have one, two, three, four, five.

9660
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,300
But I also have

9670
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,401
why one is an interface,

9680
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,769
why two is an interface, and this

9690
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,570
is an interface.

9700
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,872
And the way

9710
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,275
we want to draw it is that

9720
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,276
the interfaces

9730
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,811
each interface has on the right,

9740
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,047
I'm going to draw the positions,

9750
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:22,914
SPIVAK: the outputs.

9760
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,783
SPIVAK: So this thing is pushing out stuff

9770
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,984
to the right

9780
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,419
and on the left

9790
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,589
it's inputting forces or directions.

9800
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,624
So maybe this is me here

9810
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,993
and I'm seeing through my eyes

9820
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:35,760
and I'm outputting

9830
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,628
some visual signal

9840
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,197
and I'm putting some auditory signal,

9850
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,267
and then somebody else is receiving

9860
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,868
that auditory signal

9870
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,870
and seeing some other thing,

9880
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,005
and then other person

9890
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,207
is saying something and doing something.

9900
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:49,507
SPIVAK: Okay.

9910
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,177
SPIVAK: So each box will have the positions.

9920
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,211
It can be on the left,

9930
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,412
on the right, sorry.

9940
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,648
And the inputs or sensations

9950
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,283
or forces on the left.

9960
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,551
And my outputs

9970
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,452
become things

9980
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,786
that force you

9990
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,321
or direct you or push you or

10000
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,324
our input to you

10010
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,593
if we're connected like this.

10020
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,496
So inside of each box you could imagine

10030
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,263
there's a state

10040
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,398
and it's changing based on

10050
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,132
what's coming in

10060
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,267
from the left hand wires.

10070
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,570
SPIVAK: So inside of each box, the state

10080
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,538
and it's it's being affected by

10090
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,873
what's left and is pushing out

10100
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,408
data on the right

10110
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,744
and then the multiple interfaces

10120
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,045
are interacting together

10130
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,213
in this arrangement.

10140
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,748
So why one is supposed to be

10150
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,749
the outer box

10160
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,584
here, this middle sized red box

10170
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,619
is why one, the arrangement

10180
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,390
is this formation of wires here.

10190
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,659
SPIVAK: This one thing is the enclosure.

10200
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,559
It is enclosing

10210
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,494
these three things

10220
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,028
like public

10230
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,162
institute encloses

10240
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,232
some workers inside of it, or I enclose

10250
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,768
some organs inside of me

10260
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,069
or something like that.

10270
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,437
And then these arrangements

10280
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,406
finally can be nested hierarchically.

10290
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,341
So there is me and there's you,

10300
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,842
and then we're communicating.

10310
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,310
But inside of us is more stuff.

10320
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,148
And then we're forming this to call.

10330
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:03,515
SPIVAK: Okay.

10340
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:03,982
SPIVAK: I hope

10350
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,619
SPIVAK: all that terminology is making sense

10360
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,387
and feels natural.

10370
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:11,923
The thing I

10380
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,323
didn't say

10390
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,391
here and it's very hard to draw

10400
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,359
is that the arrangements can

10410
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,460
change through time

10420
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,095
based on what flows within them.

10430
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,931
So if I say, Hey, please

10440
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,933
mute me or something like that,

10450
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:22,567
it might

10460
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,702
change the arrangement

10470
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,371
so that you're no longer receiving

10480
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,105
from me.

10490
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,473
SPIVAK: So the arrangement can change your time

10500
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,607
based on what flows

10510
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,442
at the end of this call.

10520
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,276
When we say goodbye,

10530
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,580
it will change the arrangement.

10540
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:35,980
Okay,

10550
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,248
so now we're really moving into mass.

10560
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,416
So as we said,

10570
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,285
the interface consists of two things

10580
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,087
a set of positions.

10590
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,822
Maybe I can be in three positions

10600
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,123
A, B or C

10610
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,459
or maybe I have 44 real numbers

10620
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,626
worth of positions.

10630
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,196
SPIVAK: I'm just outputting this gigantic

10640
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,564
44 dimensional vector

10650
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,065
constantly or something.

10660
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,033
But whatever you

10670
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:55,867
the point is to

10680
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:56,968
make an accounting system

10690
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,570
so you can model what you think

10700
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,773
are being what the positions are.

10710
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,841
Maybe you can

10720
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,142
you can decide for yourself

10730
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,411
which set of positions are being

10740
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,781
being of type A could have

10750
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,882
what set a position

10760
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,017
as being a type B could have.

10770
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,453
SPIVAK: So secondly, for every position,

10780
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,789
there's a set of forces F,

10790
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,524
F, bracket orbit

10800
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,426
or inputs

10810
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,529
you could call this consortium.

10820
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,497
It's what can arrive

10830
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,498
when you're in that position.

10840
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,799
If you're a protein and you're folded

10850
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,100
up, maybe you just can't receive

10860
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,869
certain things on your interior.

10870
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,070
You don't receive charge.

10880
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,104
But when you're unfolded, your

10890
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,773
receiving charge

10900
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,474
or if you're a hedgehog,

10910
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,977
as Tony Smyth says, when you're folded

10920
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,411
up, you can't receive stuff

10930
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,147
on your belly or something.

10940
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,183
SPIVAK: Okay, so, so we'll encode

10950
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,551
this as a polynomial

10960
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,620
in a single variable y

10970
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,956
y y because it stands for unit

10980
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,191
in category theory

10990
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,592
and because it doesn't,

11000
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,461
I don't know, somehow it kind of

11010
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,295
makes you realize

11020
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,263
this isn't your standard

11030
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,931
polynomial, it's not an x.

11040
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:00,398
I don't know.

11050
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,466
I just use y.

11060
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,601
It's traditional for me at this point

11070
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,003
and this is going to be a polynomial

11080
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,738
with non-negative coefficients.

11090
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,772
SPIVAK: When you think of polynomials,

11100
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,873
you might think about numbers

11110
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:09,474
in like

11120
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,009
x squared of five

11130
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,677
is 25 and stuff like that.

11140
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,344
But I'm not going to be

11150
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,312
plugging in numbers

11160
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,747
into these polynomials.

11170
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,849
They're really just ways of housing,

11180
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,951
the data structure

11190
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,685
or like what

11200
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,153
we're going to want to work with.

11210
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:22,954
So I know it's strange,

11220
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,989
but it works really well and it's formal

11230
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,057
and I don't mean to freak out

11240
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,125
when you see the sum sign,

11250
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,760
because even though I'm showing you

11260
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,295
the map and not intending for you

11270
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:30,962
to like

11280
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,864
completely follow it or need it,

11290
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,432
it's an accounting system,

11300
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,733
but like Fibonacci coming to the

11310
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,968
West, like you might not

11320
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,003
SPIVAK: be able to use it right

11330
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,737
away, but

11340
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,939
but if you're interested, you'll,

11350
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,040
you could work.

11360
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,975
So an interface might be

11370
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,810
this would be the whole interface

11380
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,645
if you set up positions P

11390
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,347
And this dummy variable

11400
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,149
Y that's always just going to be there

11410
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,383
because it kind of holds

11420
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,652
the place for this exponent

11430
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,188
and the exponent in the position

11440
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,224
ie is the set of forces

11450
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,525
you can get in position.

11460
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:00,925
SPIVAK: II

11470
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,594
So now we've made math

11480
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,962
for this interface thing

11490
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,263
which has positions

11500
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,565
and for every position, a set of forces

11510
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,967
that can depend on the position,

11520
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,767
whether your eyes are closed

11530
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,202
or open, etc.

11540
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,672
So imagine the interface was the sum

11550
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,610
y y cubed like you buy cubed 62 times

11560
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,545
y to the zero zero.

11570
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,013
You add all those up

11580
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,581
that would have one position.

11590
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,016
SPIVAK: It had five inputs.

11600
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,251
So this sensorium,

11610
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,585
when the person's in this position

11620
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,187
would be five possible distinctions

11630
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,088
it could make,

11640
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,523
whereas in these 62 positions

11650
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,959
they could run around the 62 and b

11660
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,427
you would watch them running around here

11670
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,228
and every time you would

11680
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,463
know they're receiving three

11690
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,098
possible

11700
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:40,832
distinctions as

11710
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,699
inputs, whereas

11720
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,367
when they're over here,

11730
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,501
they're receiving five.

11740
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,235
SPIVAK: When they're over here,

11750
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,137
they're receiving the zero

11760
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,106
they they can't receive ever

11770
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,474
they can't receive.

11780
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,009
Here's another polynomial

11790
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,344
r cubed y to the right of the million.

11800
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,481
If it satisfies this thing,

11810
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,282
these don't have to be set.

11820
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,549
It's finite sets.

11830
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,717
So in this thing,

11840
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,852
it's positions,

11850
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,420
it runs around are three.

11860
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,820
So now it's

11870
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,321
running around

11880
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,856
not only on the surface of the earth,

11890
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,823
but it's just running around

11900
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,691
wherever it wants to

11910
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,558
in some kind of fixed

11920
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,093
coordinates system of the world,

11930
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,194
of the universe.

11940
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,230
SPIVAK: And at any point, no matter where it is,

11950
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,033
it's always receiving exactly a million

11960
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,101
inputs.

11970
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,537
So maybe it's receiving a thousand

11980
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,972
by thousand image.

11990
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,073
It's got some.

12000
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,641
So that is what is receiving.

12010
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,742
But you just make your own.

12020
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:25,743
It's an accounting system

12030
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:25,944
for you

12040
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,546
to make your own thing,

12050
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,081
your own interface,

12060
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,283
and you can make as many as you want.

12070
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,419
SPIVAK: So why why do all this craziness

12080
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,119
with polynomials?

12090
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,155
Because what's amazing to me

12100
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,556
is that the polynomial operations

12110
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,725
mean things in terms of interfaces.

12120
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,126
We can add polynomials.

12130
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:42,927
You know how to do that.

12140
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,330
You can multiply polynomials.

12150
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,863
You might remember

12160
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,032
you do some kind of people call it foil.

12170
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,169
You just kind of multiply polynomials.

12180
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,771
You can compose two polynomials

12190
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,040
like P of Q,

12200
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,075
but then there's some operations

12210
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:57,575
you probably haven't

12220
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:57,875
heard of,

12230
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,144
like tensor and or an internal hum.

12240
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,580
SPIVAK: And these are just

12250
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:03,781
these are

12260
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,148
what are called

12270
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,083
manual structures

12280
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,417
on and a manual closure

12290
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,619
on a category of polynomials.

12300
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,122
And I'm not telling you what that means.

12310
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,290
If you do a category theory,

12320
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,891
you can look at it.

12330
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,394
You know already what it means.

12340
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,161
But

12350
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,764
but they all mean something to us in

12360
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,200
terms of what you can do to interfaces.

12370
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,534
SPIVAK: I'm just repeating this interface here.

12380
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,503
So if I had one of these called P

12390
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,038
and you had one of these called Q,

12400
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:27,872
you could add them,

12410
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,740
you could multiply them, you

12420
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,074
could compose them, etc.

12430
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,045
So suppose P and

12440
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,312
you are

12450
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,313
polynomials representing

12460
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,281
two different interfaces.

12470
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,317
Then what?

12480
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,119
P plus Q Well, it's another,

12490
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,120
it's another polynomial.

12500
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,489
So it again represents an interface

12510
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,456
and it would be the sort of,

12520
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:45,790
it would be

12530
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,290
the interface

12540
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,025
that can output

12550
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,628
a position of P or if you

12560
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,997
and its consortium in a given position

12570
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,665
is whichever

12580
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,967
if it's a position of P,

12590
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,769
it would be the consortium of that thing

12600
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,003
or the forces there.

12610
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,304
If it's a position of

12620
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,173
Q would be the sensorimotor forces

12630
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,075
that you can get there.

12640
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,111
So if he was this interface,

12650
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,146
this kind of thing, that output,

12660
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,180
these sorts of positions

12670
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,182
and input, these sorts of forces and.

12680
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,850
Q Is this one then? P plus?

12690
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,652
Q Is what nine Y to the fifth

12700
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,954
plus two Y to the fourth plus y cubed?

12710
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,190
SPIVAK: And that would be like a machine

12720
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,558
that can be either

12730
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,793
in one of these three states

12740
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,128
or one, these six states,

12750
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,263
sorry, positions.

12760
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,197
And when they are,

12770
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:26,898
they'd be input

12780
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,900
inputting five possible distinctions

12790
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,002
or one of these two

12800
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,003
inputting for possible

12810
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:32,970
distinction, etc..

12820
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,440
So

12830
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,675
that's what P plus Q represents.

12840
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,376
It's something

12850
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,745
making a new interface,

12860
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,413
but P times Q represents

12870
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,314
making a new interface

12880
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,883
in a different way.

12890
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:46,951
SPIVAK: Something with this interface

12900
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,485
would output.

12910
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,152
Both of

12920
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,187
you have to like to remember

12930
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,255
how you multiply polynomials

12940
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,424
for basically the sum ends

12950
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,593
of the product. Polynomial.

12960
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:55,993
A sum

12970
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,528
end of this thing is a sum

12980
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,031
end of P and a sum end up Q.

12990
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,901
So the positions of this thing

13000
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,436
would be a pair consisting

13010
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,040
of position of P and a position of Q,

13020
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,309
but an input there or a sensation

13030
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,243
or distinction you can make.

13040
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,146
SPIVAK: There would be one of either P or a Q

13050
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,481
because like just

13060
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,348
if you remember, like what

13070
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,583
a p was five

13080
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,851
Y to the force

13090
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,085
output, five different things

13100
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,587
and inputs for no matter what.

13110
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,056
And key was six y cubed

13120
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,890
outputting six

13130
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,924
and inputting three

13140
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:27,859
that when you multiply them

13150
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,161
you would output 30.

13160
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:30,962
I'm just multiplying

13170
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,729
straight across here

13180
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,197
30 Y to the seventh

13190
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,800
so you output both a position MP

13200
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,602
and a position and Q a position

13210
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,970
in a five by six grid.

13220
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,506
SPIVAK: Here are.

13230
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,574
And then you'd input one of seven things

13240
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,810
either something to P or something to Q.

13250
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,846
That's just what times does.

13260
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,580
You could say, Well,

13270
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,282
I want to input to both of them.

13280
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,083
I don't want to input to

13290
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,451
just one or the other.

13300
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,318
And then you're using

13310
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,387
a different operation called Tensor.

13320
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,488
So P ten tensor

13330
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,891
Q takes these two things and multiplies

13340
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,992
both positions

13350
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,294
and the directions and the sensoria

13360
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,265
and lets you output both and input both

13370
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,432
all the time.

13380
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,268
SPIVAK: So this operation does that

13390
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,269
times operation does.

13400
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:11,769
When I said

13410
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,403
plus operation

13420
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,804
does that composition,

13430
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:14,372
is it interesting?

13440
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,207
One, when you compose polynomials,

13450
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,708
what it would do is an output

13460
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,977
would be something that output a P

13470
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,180
and then also a strategy

13480
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,182
for no matter what the P input was,

13490
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,683
an output, a q

13500
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,184
it doesn't,

13510
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,852
it doesn't have to wait for you

13520
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,321
to tell it what the input to P was.

13530
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,422
SPIVAK: It'll just

13540
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,390
give you the strategy

13550
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,558
for automatically output

13560
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,760
an accusing once you know an input.

13570
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,096
So it runs P then Q in series and then.

13580
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:39,764
Yeah.

13590
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,731
And so

13600
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,201
this thing kind of outputs a protocol.

13610
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:43,834
I think I'm going to see

13620
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,635
that on the next slide

13630
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,137
a little better so

13640
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,071
or pretty soon

13650
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,573
the or operation runs either

13660
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,608
P or Q or both in parallel.

13670
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,910
SPIVAK: And then this bracketing operation

13680
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,047
runs arrangements for wiring.

13690
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,148
If you

13700
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,051
if you remember what that means, like

13710
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,219
I'll get into this a little more,

13720
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,654
but this one is going to output

13730
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,990
arrangements of P and Q

13740
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,460
and input what flows on the wires.

13750
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,394
So that's going to be an interesting

13760
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,896
one for us later.

13770
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:12,863
And I'm really saying

13780
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,599
is that all these different operations

13790
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,566
take interfaces

13800
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,401
and make new interfaces out of them,

13810
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,137
and that allows you to kind of build

13820
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,908
things up modular.

13830
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,909
SPIVAK: We're also going to be able to

13840
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,876
we can also formalize

13850
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,877
the notion of arrangement.

13860
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,013
So we thought about ourselves

13870
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,581
in the Zoom call as an arrangement

13880
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,816
because Zoom lets

13890
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,516
my outputs

13900
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,485
be your inputs and vice versa.

13910
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,454
But you can also think about cells

13920
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,123
and organs and or cells or cell organ

13930
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,761
arranged in a cell or cells in a tissue.

13940
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,428
SPIVAK: The arrangement is

13950
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,264
just how the information passes

13960
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,732
between those interfaces.

13970
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:48,633
I'm not so concerned

13980
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,101
about the spatial arrangement

13990
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,036
except as it allows information to pass

14000
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,971
between the interfaces.

14010
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,706
So here's a picture again

14020
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,274
and the or

14030
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,577
interesting of the arrangement.

14040
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,079
So two things about this picture.

14050
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,880
You can see that

14060
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,515
the arrangement is how information

14070
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,284
passes between interfaces.

14080
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,919
You can kind of see it visually, but

14090
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,487
two things about

14100
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,390
this will be generalized.

14110
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,091
SPIVAK: First, the information sharing can be

14120
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,159
much messier.

14130
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:15,793
You don't,

14140
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,228
you don't except in the circuit.

14150
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,463
You don't just have a perfect wires.

14160
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,032
The inputs here might be affected

14170
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,333
by all sorts of stuff.

14180
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,034
And second,

14190
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,202
the information sharing can change,

14200
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,171
like the interfaces can change shape.

14210
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,506
I might close my eyes,

14220
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,774
but also the thing I say to

14230
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,409
you might change your inner interaction.

14240
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,478
SPIVAK: So that's contained in this notion of

14250
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,079
an arrangement.

14260
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,516
So formally, if you do know

14270
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,317
category theory,

14280
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,051
then you've probably heard

14290
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:40,885
of categories,

14300
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,887
sphincters and natural transformations.

14310
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:43,788
And polynomials

14320
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,056
are in fact folders

14330
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,291
from set to set and arrangement.

14340
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,460
It looks like this picture,

14350
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,795
but all I mean by

14360
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,029
it is a natural transformation

14370
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:52,963
of polynomials.

14380
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,632
So every one of these pictures

14390
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,599
can be translated

14400
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,801
into a natural transformation

14410
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,803
of polynomial functions.

14420
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,572
SPIVAK: And what this picture would be is

14430
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,140
you take the little arrangement,

14440
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,342
little interfaces, p one,

14450
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,277
P2P three, four, five,

14460
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,446
you would tensor them together

14470
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,381
and then the arrangement itself

14480
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,582
would be a natural transformation

14490
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,618
from P1 10 to 2055 to.

14500
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,822
Q The outer outer interface here

14510
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,125
now what's happening?

14520
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,660
So brief interlude for matter stuff.

14530
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,194
I just told you

14540
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:23,761
that an arrangement

14550
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,762
is not for transformation

14560
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,330
of polynomial functions

14570
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,832
and all that category theory

14580
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,899
and I'm not expecting you to know

14590
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,667
category theory.

14600
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,668
SPIVAK: I'm not expecting the audience

14610
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,802
till category three.

14620
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:32,837
So what's up with why?

14630
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,072
Why would I even tell you that stuff?

14640
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,574
I'm just trying to show you

14650
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,641
what the math looks like.

14660
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,310
Let any technical person in the audience

14670
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,011
who does know category theory

14680
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,079
see that I'm

14690
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,947
what I'm talking about

14700
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,447
and kind of know

14710
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,082
where to look for what's next.

14720
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,551
SPIVAK: But for everyone else or everyone.

14730
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,053
I just want to show

14740
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,854
what the math looks like

14750
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:50,988
and what it's about,

14760
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,824
because so much of math is quantitative,

14770
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,593
or maybe it's about shapes or something,

14780
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,061
but this math is really different.

14790
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,596
So I want you to see it

14800
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,930
because I want you to ask like,

14810
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,331
what is it?

14820
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,333
How is this math and what is it for?

14830
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,135
SPIVAK: And the point is, it's about interfaces.

14840
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:04,735
It's about time

14850
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,569
you manipulate them,

14860
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,370
how you arrange them,

14870
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,538
how you guess them.

14880
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,840
And interfaces have outputs and inputs

14890
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,741
and they're captured.

14900
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,209
That can depend on the outputs.

14910
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,310
And that sort of structure

14920
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,879
is kind of hard to talk about cleanly,

14930
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,813
but it's really well

14940
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,581
captured with polynomials

14950
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,049
not considered as functions,

14960
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,318
but it's like ways of holding structure.

14970
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,020
SPIVAK: And then you can do these operations

14980
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,221
to the polynomials

14990
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:24,889
and they

15000
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,723
they let you make

15010
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,591
new interfaces from old

15020
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,460
and we'll be talking about arrangements

15030
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,361
and dynamics next.

15040
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:30,928
But again,

15050
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,896
they'll just be in this category

15060
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,497
of polynomial functions

15070
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,132
that it's all kind

15080
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,400
of the same story again and again.

15090
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,901
We don't have to

15100
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,536
change our accounting system

15110
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,003
to move

15120
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,771
between interfaces, arrangements,

15130
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,042
nesting dynamics, etc..

15140
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,110
SPIVAK: Okay, so dynamics,

15150
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,545
let's look at this arrangement again.

15160
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,013
What is every API,

15170
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,148
all these PS had a dynamical system

15180
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:51,982
running it.

15190
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:52,616
Well then what

15200
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,818
I'm saying here is that Q

15210
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,619
therefore would too.

15220
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,121
So a dynamical system is a thing

15230
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,791
with states that evolve through time.

15240
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,460
My current emotional state

15250
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,327
or the state of life

15260
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:03,928
where I think

15270
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,463
I am going to talk or whatever

15280
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,464
is my current state.

15290
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,731
SPIVAK: And then I look at you guys

15300
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,500
and I see what you're looking like

15310
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,468
or I'll read the slide

15320
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,436
and then it changes and then I

15330
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,438
output something.

15340
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,607
So that's what a dynamical system is.

15350
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,309
And then it can be formalized

15360
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,344
as a system about ease or,

15370
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,379
or a discrete dynamical system.

15380
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,080
Or you can just think of it

15390
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,015
as a high level idea.

15400
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,184
SPIVAK: And I've said this so many times now,

15410
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,085
but I'll say over time

15420
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,086
you're in a state

15430
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,155
that shows up as your position,

15440
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,423
in other words, your output,

15450
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,457
and then any possible input

15460
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,727
you get would change your state.

15470
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:37,495
And right.

15480
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,562
So the math could be discrete

15490
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,231
or continuous. It both works.

15500
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,300
This formula set up.

15510
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,302
So mathematically a dynamical system

15520
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,105
one P is a natural transformation

15530
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,274
swi to the s to p

15540
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,943
where s is a set of states.

15550
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,144
SPIVAK: Again, why am I telling you this?

15560
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,746
Because all the math looks the same.

15570
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,280
Whether you're talking

15580
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,881
about arrangements

15590
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,982
as natural transformation

15600
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,683
between polynomial countries,

15610
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,684
or you're talking about

15620
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:02,453
dynamical

15630
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,420
systems themselves

15640
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,523
and happening these interfaces,

15650
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,390
they're all just natural

15660
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,057
transformations

15670
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,527
between polynomial functions

15680
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,861
and then

15690
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,463
given the arrangement

15700
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,431
of all these PS inside of Q,

15710
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,567
which is natural estimation

15720
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,201
and giving this now

15730
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,702
transformation here, the dynamics

15740
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,904
in each of them,

15750
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,773
you get the dynamics in. Q

15760
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,441
So if I had a dynamical system

15770
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,309
in it, so.

15780
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:31,081
Q By composing natural transformations.

15790
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,884
So this is currently the last slide.

15800
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,787
I want to think about dynamics

15810
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,321
a bit more.

15820
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:37,821
So if you remember

15830
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,823
a few slides ago,

15840
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,792
I was talking about operations

15850
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,762
in a dynamical system on P plus Q

15860
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:45,296
would be one

15870
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:45,930
that can switch

15880
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,298
between P mode and Q mode.

15890
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:47,932
SPIVAK: So sometimes you're out

15900
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,167
SPIVAK: putting P stuff in and putting from it.

15910
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,536
Sometimes you are putting Q stuff

15920
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,437
in inputting from that.

15930
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,539
So sorry, I'm a

15940
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,273
little bit sick,

15950
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,642
so my voice is not great today.

15960
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,210
A dynamical system on p times

15970
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,546
Q would output both simultaneously

15980
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,148
in any state.

15990
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,249
It's outputting both,

16000
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,051
but it can receive from just one

16010
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,118
or the other

16020
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,721
a dynamical system on p tensor Q

16030
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,257
would output both and receive from both

16040
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,059
a dynamical system

16050
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,994
and p composed Q would be

16060
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,228
would do the serial protocol

16070
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:18,829
where it outputs

16080
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,965
a P and outputs a strategy

16090
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,733
for taking any input on P

16100
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,703
and and turning it into an output on Q.

16110
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,304
SPIVAK: And then it would listen

16120
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,274
for an input on P and an input a Q

16130
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,109
so kind of just tells you, here's

16140
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:32,643
what I'm going to do.

16150
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,111
No matter what you do,

16160
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,613
it gives you a serial protocol,

16170
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,747
is what I'm saying.

16180
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,749
And what about P intercom?

16190
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,051
Q This is the in the category

16200
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,186
polynomials functions.

16210
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,555
There is a internal home for tensor.

16220
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,156
SPIVAK: You may have absolutely no idea

16230
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,358
what I'm talking about,

16240
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,692
but it's something that comes with

16250
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,494
the math that no one created it.

16260
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,462
It wasn't invented.

16270
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,664
It just is part of the structure.

16280
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,064
Kind of like

16290
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:54,632
the complex

16300
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,467
numbers are miraculous in

16310
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,901
the sense that you

16320
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,871
you say you want algebraic closure

16330
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:01,572
and all of a sudden

16340
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,539
you get

16350
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,041
you get if I have one derivative,

16360
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:04,975
then I'm all derivatives

16370
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,609
and stuff like that.

16380
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,411
SPIVAK: So it's kind of the category

16390
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,345
polynomial functions

16400
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,313
is kind of miraculous.

16410
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,248
It has tons and tons of structure

16420
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,483
that no one asked it to have.

16430
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,751
It just has.

16440
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,219
But what is this structure,

16450
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,720
this internal hum?

16460
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,921
Well, it's the sort of thing

16470
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,024
that runs arrangements for P and Q.

16480
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,361
So a dynamical system on this thing

16490
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,497
where I tensor P one, two,

16500
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,031
three, three, four

16510
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,466
or five comma Q and put it in brackets.

16520
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,934
SPIVAK: This internal hall,

16530
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,871
what it does, it's a dynamical system.

16540
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,372
This is a polynomial,

16550
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,340
even though it looks like

16560
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,074
a big expression.

16570
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,043
It's itself a polynomial.

16580
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,679
And this polynomial has outputs

16590
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,981
and has inputs as usual.

16600
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:44,581
And so what it

16610
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,116
dynamical system on this would do is

16620
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:46,950
would be output

16630
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,119
arrangements in the output. Okay.

16640
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,054
Now I want you to wire two

16650
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:50,654
you and you to y

16660
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,289
or to you and you to y review.

16670
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,224
SPIVAK: So if you were forming an institute,

16680
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,726
you'd say, wow,

16690
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,361
let's have

16700
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,797
this guy report to that person

16710
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,065
and all that sort of stuff,

16720
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,300
and you would create some arrangement.

16730
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,234
And then that's

16740
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:04,902
what you output,

16750
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,471
as you say, and then you listen

16760
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,906
and you see what flows on the wires

16770
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,808
and you see how Alice is talking to Bob

16780
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,209
and now Bob is talking to Carla

16790
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,377
and all that stuff.

16800
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,611
SPIVAK: And you listen to that,

16810
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,612
and as you listen,

16820
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,581
you'd say, Hey, actually,

16830
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,183
I want Bob to report to Carla

16840
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,718
instead of Alice or whatever.

16850
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,853
And so you would change the arrangement.

16860
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,388
Your inner internal state

16870
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,623
would be to listen and receive

16880
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,359
the stuff that's flowing on the wires,

16890
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,928
and you'd be affected by that,

16900
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,429
and then you'd output new arrangements

16910
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,464
for the system.

16920
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,364
SPIVAK: And I think that's kind of

16930
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,734
getting to this morphology thing.

16940
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,435
Maybe maybe there are systems

16950
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,903
that are monitoring

16960
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,772
the sorts of transmissions

16970
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,640
that are happening between subsystems

16980
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,376
and then and then

16990
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,344
now, putting new ways

17000
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,580
that they should arrange each other.

17010
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,550
Okay, so let me give some applications,

17020
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,719
digital circuits and control systems

17030
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,920
live here.

17040
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,489
So a computer is a nested

17050
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,492
arrangement of dynamical systems.

17060
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,360
SPIVAK: Every transistor, the dynamical system,

17070
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,662
and two of them make up at NAND gate and

17080
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,433
and then you can get an or gate

17090
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,234
by wiring together

17100
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,668
three gates like this.

17110
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,103
I taken my inputs

17120
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,004
and I split them

17130
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,672
and I feed them to NAND into the NAND

17140
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:16,573
and then I put them together

17150
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,008
and I put them into the NAND

17160
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:18,942
and now I have or

17170
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:20,410
and this

17180
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,378
whole thing

17190
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,479
is just like

17200
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,314
NAND has two inputs and one output.

17210
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,048
SPIVAK: This whole thing

17220
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,383
has to input to an output,

17230
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,186
but It's got some internal structure

17240
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,721
and now we've got an or a gate

17250
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,922
we could nest or gates and

17260
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,793
and gates and NAND gates and we can get

17270
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,594
outer circuits and multiplying

17280
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,863
circuits and, and

17290
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,133
alias arithmetic

17300
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,334
units, whatever

17310
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:48,305
and, and CPU's and monitors

17320
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,173
and they're all made

17330
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,475
just with transistors

17340
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,378
like the memory cells are all,

17350
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,012
are all

17360
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,847
like flip flops are just

17370
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,582
situated transistors.

17380
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,217
SPIVAK: And so we can kind of

17390
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,686
make this nested system of transistors

17400
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,788
and get a computer.

17410
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,123
And so the arrangement

17420
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,025
here is all really simple.

17430
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,459
It's never changing in time,

17440
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,595
it's soldered in it, it's fixed

17450
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,064
unlike us on the Zoom call.

17460
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,566
It's dynamics are simple.

17470
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:16,900
Every state is just a function

17480
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,770
of the input only and it just use it.

17490
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,537
SPIVAK: There's no memory

17500
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,272
in the in the transistors

17510
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,509
and yet because of loops in the wiring

17520
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,610
in the arrangement,

17530
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,511
we get

17540
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,478
all possible

17550
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,414
things that the computer can do.

17560
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,549
So with enough nesting and enough

17570
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,651
interesting arrangements,

17580
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,053
even though the arrangements internally

17590
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,588
are not that difficult

17600
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,355
when you nest them,

17610
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,557
they get really amazing in the sense

17620
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:41,692
you get a computer

17630
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,694
and that is the dynamical system

17640
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,428
that is happening

17650
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,963
right now, allowing for this Zoom

17660
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,497
call to take place.

17670
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,233
SPIVAK: I guess there's some internet stuff too

17680
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,200
that I don't know how it's made,

17690
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,502
but the computers made this way.

17700
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:54,905
Control systems also

17710
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,039
have complicated dynamics.

17720
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,306
Let's say

17730
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,975
this is a power plant or something.

17740
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:58,542
But again,

17750
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,343
I think they

17760
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,211
basically have fixed arrangement.

17770
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,247
So your cruise control in your car

17780
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,147
isn't changing,

17790
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,117
whether it's listening to the gas or the

17800
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,418
maybe for the battery

17810
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,653
in a in a hybrid car,

17820
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:10,988
there would be a changing arrangement.

17830
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,923
But at least the old fashioned

17840
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,791
control systems have a fixed arrangement

17850
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,692
of how the feedbacks

17860
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,496
going to work to control the the speed

17870
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,600
or whatever temperature.

17880
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,167
Deep learning

17890
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,502
also fits into the formalism

17900
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:26,770
upon the wheel functions,

17910
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,938
but in a different way.

17920
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,740
Here the interfaces are all the same.

17930
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,074
They're all outputting a real

17940
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,676
and inputting a real

17950
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,177
now.

17960
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:34,912
And the arrangements

17970
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,712
are all really simple.

17980
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,447
SPIVAK: They're activated weighted sums.

17990
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,116
Now I'm drawing this differently

18000
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:39,816
than most people would.

18010
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:40,751
Most people would put these

18020
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,121
three boxes on the left of this big box

18030
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,291
and they'd wire the three things in.

18040
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,292
And it would seem like

18050
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,960
this was a box taking our three

18060
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,463
are the way I'm thinking about it,

18070
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:54,698
because I want to put this

18080
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,800
into the context of this accounting.

18090
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,335
SPIVAK: So to a polynomial function,

18100
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,738
it works better to think about a neuron

18110
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,840
listening to some neurons on its left

18120
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,208
or some predecessor thing.

18130
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,810
So like a higher level thing,

18140
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,179
listening to lower level things,

18150
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:09,713
it makes more

18160
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,514
sense in this formalism

18170
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,483
to put them inside.

18180
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,918
And then the arrangement

18190
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:15,886
isn't just a fixed,

18200
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,621
it isn't just a wiring diagram,

18210
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,922
but it has more structure.

18220
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:19,323
SPIVAK: As I said,

18230
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,157
those wiring diagrams

18240
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,592
were just easy cases.

18250
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,294
Often it's more complex,

18260
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,629
but they're still arrangements

18270
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,364
in the sense of natural transformations,

18280
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,732
polynomial functions.

18290
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,100
And what this arrangement would do

18300
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,135
is it take the output of these sub guys

18310
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,937
and wait them, maybe

18320
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:34,471
multiply this

18330
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,372
by 3.2,

18340
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,873
etc., add them up

18350
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,976
and then do an activation function

18360
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,011
and output that to the higher level,

18370
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,245
bigger thing,

18380
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,514
and then when it gets a loss in,

18390
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,816
it would take the gradient

18400
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,218
and pass the components of that

18410
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,020
gradient to the three

18420
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,689
or pass the

18430
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,657
components of that loss

18440
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,825
to the three things

18450
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,594
and then take the gradient and change

18460
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,762
the wiring diagram,

18470
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,463
not the wiring

18480
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,697
but the interaction pattern.

18490
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,633
SPIVAK: So a change these three numbers.

18500
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,168
So the information flowing out

18510
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,336
is the inner box's current.

18520
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,104
Guess about what's

18530
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,238
going on in the world,

18540
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,906
the current weighted sum.

18550
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:10,907
It's like

18560
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,476
these guys send out their guesses,

18570
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,610
we add them up,

18580
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,811
we send our guess

18590
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,646
as the higher level manager here,

18600
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,348
and then we get some lost function.

18610
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,784
We distribute it to our sub units.

18620
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,920
SPIVAK: We also use it to change the arrangement

18630
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,554
here.

18640
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,790
So this the changing of weights

18650
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,159
in the training of neural network is the

18660
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,028
is the changing arrangements

18670
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,829
that I've been kind of pushing

18680
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,299
this whole time, right?

18690
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,501
The arrangement is dynamic.

18700
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,668
The loss

18710
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,337
not only is sent a little boxes,

18720
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,305
but is updating the arrangement,

18730
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,273
the collection of weights

18740
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:47,677
so deep

18750
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,713
neural networks is one of four examples

18760
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,347
we currently have

18770
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,015
of a certain structure that

18780
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,016
a post-doc

18790
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,051
working with me named Brandon

18800
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,852
SHAPIRO and I are calling

18810
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,554
a dynamic organizational structure

18820
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,523
or dynamic operand.

18830
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,157
SPIVAK: It's a fractal

18840
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,224
like system of arrangements

18850
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,993
that change through time,

18860
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,127
where the arrangement decides

18870
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:04,928
how information flows

18880
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:05,495
through the system,

18890
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,797
just like I've been saying.

18900
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,165
And yet the flowing information

18910
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,232
contains the arrangement,

18920
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,801
just like I've been saying.

18930
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,701
And we formalized

18940
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,170
this using category theory

18950
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,937
and the four examples

18960
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,038
we have our deep learning,

18970
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:15,772
which I was talking about

18980
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,208
in the previous slide prediction markets

18990
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:20,877
have been learning.

19000
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,712
SPIVAK: So this is where Sophie Lipkin

19010
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:25,248
and non-cooperative strategic games.

19020
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,683
So we have only for example

19030
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:27,217
of the structure,

19040
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,352
but I'm guessing there are many more.

19050
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,320
So I'm guessing, for example,

19060
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,289
that active inference can be another one

19070
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,690
or maybe free energy minimization

19080
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,759
or something like that.

19090
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,460
The point is that

19100
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,261
these are like very fractal structures

19110
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,397
where like be

19120
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,031
a collection

19130
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,833
of deep learners or gradient dissenters.

19140
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,567
SPIVAK: If you put them together,

19150
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,469
you get another gradient to center.

19160
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,471
If you take a bunch of predictors

19170
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,939
and make them into a single predictor,

19180
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,807
you get another predictor.

19190
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:51,775
So like the collection

19200
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,678
of predictors becomes a predictor.

19210
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:55,479
And the way that

19220
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,548
the way that predictors are,

19230
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,884
the way that wealth or trust

19240
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:01,518
is distributed

19250
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,652
between predictors

19260
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,654
is properly nested and stuff like that

19270
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:05,822
SPIVAK: didn't really go into it.

19280
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,791
SPIVAK: But I'm interested in

19290
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,027
whether well, I'll say that next slide.

19300
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:11,394
Okay.

19310
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,262
So wrapping up

19320
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:12,963
kind of made

19330
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,164
people think of math about number,

19340
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,233
but it's not a math subject.

19350
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,100
And accounting system

19360
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,368
tracks certain things.

19370
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,970
And what we're trying to track above

19380
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,638
is dynamic arrangements.

19390
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,240
The math is called polynomial functions

19400
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:23,573
and it's

19410
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,007
well known

19420
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,876
and beloved in category theory

19430
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:26,510
and it accounts

19440
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,911
for interfaces, dynamics

19450
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,313
and arrangements in a really nice way.

19460
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,781
SPIVAK: And it's about building a bigger system

19470
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,583
for little or littler parts.

19480
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,951
It accounts for composing

19490
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,419
circuits and control systems

19500
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,220
and deep learning

19510
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,788
and prediction markets.

19520
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,757
And then you could combine these

19530
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,526
because they're all in one formalism.

19540
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,161
You could take your control system

19550
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,229
and hook it up to a deep learning system

19560
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,931
and put that in a prediction market.

19570
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,366
And you,

19580
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:49,833
all of us,

19590
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,834
just polynomial functions

19600
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,869
all the way down.

19610
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,970
SPIVAK: I think it might have

19620
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,438
been, I should

19630
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:55,705
have said

19640
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,073
might have particular value

19650
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,642
in active inference

19660
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,644
because it lets us talk

19670
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,778
coherently and precisely

19680
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:02,712
about these things

19690
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,813
like changing interfaces.

19700
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:04,748
I, i,

19710
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,715
i might be wrong,

19720
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,951
but I don't know that that's the part of

19730
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,121
the formalism of active inference today

19740
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:11,755
in terms of like

19750
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:12,656
changing the arrangement

19760
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,590
and stuff like that.

19770
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,158
SPIVAK: But I'm interested to hear more

19780
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,426
you guys

19790
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:17,327
changing how things

19800
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,695
communicate, change, how

19810
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,296
the communication

19820
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:19,930
pattern itself

19830
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,600
changes as information is exchanged.

19840
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,234
But if we wanted

19850
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,468
to make active inference

19860
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:25,702
into a

19870
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,170
dynamic organizational structure,

19880
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,538
for example,

19890
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,741
you might like

19900
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,444
dynamic organizational structure.

19910
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:34,911
One person,

19920
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,980
when they saw that, they thought, Oh,

19930
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,747
you should really call it

19940
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:38,949
multi-scale

19950
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,650
dynamic organizational structure

19960
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,952
in order to really clarify your

19970
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,053
particular brand here,

19980
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,224
but maybe not so expensive.

19990
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,191
SPIVAK: So what would we do

20000
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,226
if we wanted to make

20010
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,293
free energy minimization

20020
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,329
a dynamic organizational structure?

20030
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,297
What we would specify all the interfaces

20040
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,999
that we're going to be talking about

20050
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:56,766
that would be used

20060
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,635
to house energy minimization.

20070
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,769
Like what is a free energy?

20080
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,338
Minimize or allowed to output

20090
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,273
and what are they allowed to input?

20100
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,609
And you would get clear on that step one

20110
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,876
and then you would consider

20120
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,711
how free energy

20130
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,448
minimizes arrange themselves, like what

20140
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,482
an arrangement of free energy

20150
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,017
minimization would be,

20160
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,319
where if you arrange them in that way,

20170
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,787
it would constitute

20180
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,422
a larger scale of free energy,

20190
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,624
minimize air.

20200
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,092
SPIVAK: So that's the sort of thing

20210
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,360
you would have to ask

20220
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,060
to make this

20230
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,529
into a dynamic organizational structure.

20240
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,432
And as long as they all cohere nicely,

20250
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,667
there was some form of check

20260
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,501
we would do.

20270
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,035
We would have

20280
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,570
a dynamic organizational structure.

20290
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,374
So to summarize,

20300
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:37,874
I feel like

20310
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:38,808
I've said it a million times

20320
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,343
now, but applied category theory

20330
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,645
is math for tracking

20340
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,079
interlocking structures,

20350
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,614
cohering structures.

20360
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,181
SPIVAK: It's not about

20370
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,116
how much of something there

20380
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,085
is, it's about how it's arranged.

20390
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,086
And it applies in quantum

20400
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,321
mechanics and computer science

20410
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,489
and math, material science

20420
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,690
and linguistics.

20430
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,393
But it focuses on structural questions

20440
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,294
in each one.

20450
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,695
It allows the content

20460
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,529
to be something

20470
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,531
that someone else handles later,

20480
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,632
and it's just telling you

20490
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,233
how you're going

20500
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,467
to be handling that content

20510
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,568
so that you don't kind of step

20520
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:09,039
on your toes, toes as you as you use it.

20530
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,440
SPIVAK: So I'm interested I'm interested

20540
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,474
in the structure

20550
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,543
of interacting dynamical systems,

20560
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,778
like how I want to account

20570
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,113
for be able to account for this.

20580
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:17,881
I don't want to necessarily

20590
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,149
give the account,

20600
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,317
but I want to be able to account

20610
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,484
for this stuff

20620
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,886
that we're doing here together.

20630
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,722
How we change, how we're inputting, I'm

20640
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,257
changing by turning the speaker off

20650
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,024
or disconnecting

20660
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,859
and therefore not inputting the same,

20670
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,394
or how we're outputting,

20680
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,263
muting or camera off

20690
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,264
and how all that affects

20700
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,865
what happens on this call

20710
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,634
or wherever we are and how we change

20720
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,401
and what we learn

20730
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,537
is how we make sense of things together.

20740
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,005
SPIVAK: So again, I don't have specifics,

20750
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:42,739
but what I'm offering

20760
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,107
is this accounting system,

20770
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,042
this category of polynomial functions

20780
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,844
to account for dynamic arrangements.

20790
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,512
And I'm hoping that it

20800
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,046
is helpful

20810
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,682
for thinking about active inference.

20820
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,017
So that's it.

20830
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,387
I'm happy to talk about stuff.

20840
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,088
KNIGHT: That's super awesome.

20850
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,622
David, thank you so much.

20860
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,192
I have a million questions,

20870
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,259
but I didn't want to interrupt

20880
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,462
because I was really enjoying just

20890
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,363
sharing you

20900
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,231
because it

20910
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,232
helps it gel

20920
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,701
more solidly in my brain if you can.

20930
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,236
If the interaction is like

20940
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,404
give me all the things

20950
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,405
and then let me like

20960
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:16,506
pick apart a little pieces

20970
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,174
and maybe that works for

20980
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,310
hopefully the audience also.

20990
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,211
KNIGHT: Danielle, did you

21000
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,011
are you watching the YouTube

21010
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,546
try to serve questions now?

21020
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,881
Do you want to go over there?

21030
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,083
Because I I'll interrogate him for.

21040
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,417
SPIVAK: Okay.

21050
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,219
SPIVAK: And this doesn't block you, does it.

21060
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,653
This thing up here?

21070
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,122
FRIEDMAN: No, it looks fine.

21080
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:32,489
SPIVAK: Okay.

21090
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,891
SPIVAK: I need to screen to be there.

21100
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,726
FRIEDMAN: Luke, please begin the interrogation

21110
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,560
and I'll be ready

21120
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,163
with the live questions. Cool.

21130
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:40,730
All right.

21140
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:41,998
Okay, so

21150
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,367
let me just go back to the beginning.

21160
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:45,034
And

21170
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,971
so in the very beginning, you said that

21180
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:48,638
you feel like

21190
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,340
after the defense kind of meshes

21200
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,541
with category theory.

21210
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,278
And I just am curious.

21220
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,112
I mean, I think, like,

21230
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,014
I kind of got a really good idea

21240
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,949
through the course of your talk,

21250
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,218
but maybe you could articulate the way

21260
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,855
to maybe kind of help us understand

21270
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,525
where that that basis is coming from.

21280
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,161
SPIVAK: Your that's cool. Yeah.

21290
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,062
When I when I first heard it,

21300
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:15,832
it was one thing was like utility

21310
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,234
and prediction are melded

21320
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,170
like what I want

21330
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,871
is I'm just expecting the world

21340
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:22,739
to be a certain way

21350
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,007
and what I want is for it

21360
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,074
to be that way.

21370
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,644
So if I want to

21380
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,513
if I really if I really intend

21390
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,848
to have something, it's

21400
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:32,882
because I know that

21410
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,117
I kind of deserve it.

21420
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,885
SPIVAK: I can't actually.

21430
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,287
I think people might have fantasies

21440
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,888
where they think they can

21450
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,322
get things

21460
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,657
they don't deserve or something,

21470
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,091
but it doesn't work out.

21480
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm not sure I feel like I'm

21490
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,594
going into too much there, but.

21500
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,163
But I like this idea of

21510
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,231
melding those two things

21520
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,132
because utility never

21530
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,366
really made sense to me.

21540
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,936
It's like, where do I get this

21550
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,704
utility function from?

21560
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:55,939
SPIVAK: Well, but I really

21570
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,274
what I somehow thought was like

21580
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,909
like what they're saying is like, my,

21590
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,778
my knees are a certain way.

21600
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,413
Their prediction

21610
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,148
of like the fact that gravity

21620
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,182
will be in a certain range

21630
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,851
or my lungs can take in this sort of

21640
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:08,418
or this way

21650
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,886
because of a prediction

21660
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,554
that my lineage has made

21670
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,889
about what sort of atmosphere

21680
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,657
I'm going to be put into

21690
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,493
and the things I'm saying to you right

21700
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,861
now, like utility, whatever

21710
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,862
I'm using to decide

21720
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:19,863
how good it is for me to say a

21730
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,131
thing is my prediction of what's

21740
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,200
what's actually wanted to hear.

21750
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:24,968
SPIVAK: So I like that

21760
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:25,702
SPIVAK: it was like reduce

21770
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,337
the number of variables there,

21780
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,372
like number of entities in the universe

21790
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:29,806
or something

21800
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,641
from utility and prediction

21810
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,477
just to prediction.

21820
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,245
I don't remember

21830
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,747
like other things

21840
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,048
exactly, but I just remember

21850
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,149
kind of feeling like,

21860
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,452
oh, I also like this scale free.

21870
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,721
So free energy minimization,

21880
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:48,124
for example, or, or or Bayesian predict,

21890
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,926
you know, updating stuff

21900
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:50,927
doesn't need you to be

21910
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:51,895
at a particular scale.

21920
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,130
SPIVAK: It's not about subatomic particles

21930
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,300
or something like to scale free and

21940
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,904
and that somehow it's a physics thing.

21950
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,272
Like I'm really looking for a scale

21960
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,406
free thing.

21970
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,841
You mentioned Emergence Bleu.

21980
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,242
I'm going to start talking to you

21990
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,745
about something, but but

22000
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,013
I'm not a huge fan

22010
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,014
of the concept of emergence

22020
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:11,848
because I feel like it's

22030
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:12,649
usually talking,

22040
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:13,683
assuming we're going to start

22050
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,851
from a low level

22060
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,185
and then say

22070
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,154
and then the next level is magic.

22080
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,322
SPIVAK: And then they start from that level,

22090
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:19,622
they're like,

22100
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,723
and then the next level is magic.

22110
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:20,924
And I'm

22120
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:21,624
really looking for

22130
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,661
like the principles where,

22140
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,462
the inductive step,

22150
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,231
the move from end to end.

22160
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,333
Plus one is the thing we're monitoring.

22170
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,834
So we're never like confused.

22180
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:32,635
We're like,

22190
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,303
Well, where did this

22200
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,604
amazing thing happen?

22210
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:35,805
We're always seeing

22220
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,707
we're monitoring that part. And

22230
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:39,976
I really like that

22240
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,711
free energy minimization

22250
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,279
and entropy maximization

22260
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:43,513
and stuff

22270
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:43,947
like that

22280
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,782
is the sort of thing that I could

22290
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,650
imagine happening at all scales.

22300
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,252
No matter if you're a person

22310
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:55,024
or you're a cell or you're an atom.

22320
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:55,925
KNIGHT: Cool. Definitely.

22330
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,759
KNIGHT: I have to apologize

22340
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,493
for keeping

22350
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,428
this thing out of my background,

22360
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,396
but I'll try to remember to mute.

22370
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,165
But I do think that like,

22380
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,733
yes, emergence is cool,

22390
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:04,567
but also there's

22400
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,670
this bi directional information flow.

22410
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,706
And when we had Mike Levin

22420
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,040
come onto the livestream,

22430
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,175
he really talked about it

22440
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,209
when he discusses

22450
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,144
the computational boundary of the cells.

22460
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,413
KNIGHT: So yes, like there are bottom up,

22470
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,915
there are emergent properties

22480
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,950
that happen in a collective,

22490
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,086
but there's also top down constraints

22500
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,021
on those emergent properties

22510
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:25,355
that that

22520
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,757
come from the quote, higher level

22530
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,359
or maybe like larger scale.

22540
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,593
So like if we're building things

22550
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,495
up and down, there's constraints

22560
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,163
that go down and information

22570
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:34,631
that comes up.

22580
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,898
And you've got to have

22590
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,233
this bidirectional information

22600
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,302
flow to even start to think about

22610
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,104
drawing any kind of boundary

22620
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,640
or creating like an interface around

22630
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,141
the thing itself.

22640
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,175
KNIGHT: Like that, like we,

22650
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,211
we talked about cognitive science like

22660
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:48,878
and then I don't know

22670
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,413
if you're familiar with that paper, but

22680
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,448
yeah, it was

22690
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,251
cool and something else.

22700
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:55,885
And so I know

22710
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:56,486
like you've talked

22720
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,220
with Mike a lot

22730
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,455
and also with Chris Fields

22740
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,991
and when Chris came,

22750
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,492
he really

22760
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,994
talked to us about contextually

22770
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:09,599
and he started to get into some math

22780
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,233
that I think is

22790
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,334
maybe related

22800
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,902
to some of the things

22810
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,370
that you were talking about there.

22820
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,406
KNIGHT: So you talked about operations

22830
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,608
that correspond to interactions

22840
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,677
between sets

22850
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:24,047
and tests, such as about two spaces

22860
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,848
and like channel theory.

22870
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,717
And as these like interactions

22880
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:31,954
that transform sets as info morph isms.

22890
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,322
So like,

22900
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,323
and I don't know

22910
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:35,992
if that ends up like language

22920
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,661
speaks to, to this or is like,

22930
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,130
it's hard for me to tell

22940
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,031
what is the language

22950
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,800
of category theory and,

22960
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,235
and what is like the application

22970
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:47,737
of the category theory

22980
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,505
to something in real life

22990
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,240
or that's not just,

23000
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:51,574
you know,

23010
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:52,442
the set of X such

23020
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:52,909
that X

23030
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,643
is less equal

23040
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,279
to like these kinds of math words.

23050
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,647
SPIVAK: Right? Yeah.

23060
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,282
So the two spaces stuff

23070
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,183
is definitely category

23080
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,984
theory and reliefs.

23090
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,353
There's a nice way of talking about the

23100
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,354
relationship between

23110
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,523
two spaces upon email

23120
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,024
functions,

23130
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:08,691
although I don't

23140
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:09,692
have it on the tip of my tongue

23150
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,694
right now?

23160
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,763
So these polynomial functions

23170
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,932
are kind of bidirectional

23180
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,166
because the like

23190
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,101
if you have these arrangements

23200
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:23,172
which are maps of polynomial functions,

23210
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,943
this sort of thing, this quote unquote

23220
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,544
higher level thing

23230
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:32,148
is talking to the lower level things,

23240
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:32,915
lower level

23250
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,250
things are talking to each other

23260
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,151
and they're also talking

23270
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,152
to the higher level thing.

23280
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:36,819
SPIVAK: So there's this kind of

23290
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,121
SPIVAK: bidirectional thing

23300
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,890
there and so on that level, I'd say,

23310
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,594
yes, it does sound similar to what

23320
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,895
Chris Fields was saying.

23330
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,063
And then

23340
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,164
but you also ask like,

23350
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,234
what is the application of category?

23360
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,469
So once you have an accounting system,

23370
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,204
you can build a tool from it.

23380
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,105
So if someone says, Hey,

23390
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:56,506
I got this

23400
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,273
great idea,

23410
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,208
it's all about plus and times

23420
01:02:59,208 --> 01:02:59,475
and like

23430
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,344
dollars can be added but not multiplied

23440
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:02,912
and they can be multiplied by numbers

23450
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,013
but not each other,

23460
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,815
whatever you make this rule,

23470
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,582
and then someone could

23480
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:07,550
build a spreadsheet that

23490
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,220
program that incorporates that rule.

23500
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,756
SPIVAK: And maybe current spreadsheets

23510
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:14,190
don't allow

23520
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,092
you don't keep you on the rails

23530
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:16,559
with respect

23540
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,994
to not multiplying $2 figures.

23550
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,395
But you could imagine that they

23560
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,363
they did.

23570
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,098
So what's the application?

23580
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:22,732
The application

23590
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:23,132
is it once

23600
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,834
you have the accounting system,

23610
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,469
the mathematical counting system,

23620
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,770
you can build tools from it

23630
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,205
or you can just think through it on

23640
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,573
a whiteboard or something.

23650
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,342
SPIVAK: But if you build tools,

23660
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,711
let's that's a major way people use

23670
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,980
math, calculus or whatever.

23680
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,849
They simulate things.

23690
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:40,817
You use category theory.

23700
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,551
What you do

23710
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,385
is you say,

23720
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,254
I have this noodle category called poly.

23730
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,356
And then someone says,

23740
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,691
you know, they want to implement it.

23750
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,792
Well, instead of thinking

23760
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:50,660
about all the features

23770
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,728
they want from an interface language,

23780
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:53,229
they're like,

23790
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,297
Oh, and let's have it

23800
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,231
print like this

23810
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:55,832
and let's have it

23820
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,999
publish the web like that.

23830
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:57,667
SPIVAK: And like,

23840
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,569
you know, they have all these features.

23850
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:00,837
What it allows you to do is not

23860
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,005
look at any feature requests.

23870
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,073
You could just implement

23880
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,174
the accounting system,

23890
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,677
you just put it in there, just the map

23900
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,811
and you call it a day.

23910
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:09,512
And then if somebody

23920
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,681
else wants to add stuff, you do it later

23930
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,883
and you don't use that to influence

23940
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,252
kind of the basic code.

23950
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,553
SPIVAK: And it allows you to break very,

23960
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,721
very highly structured

23970
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,857
and very compressed code that does

23980
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,124
that does

23990
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,227
all of the major backend

24000
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,561
work of the thing.

24010
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:26,696
And then every other feature

24020
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,831
request is, you know,

24030
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,066
that's kind of the gold plating

24040
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,133
or like the thing that makes

24050
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,269
a user interface for it. But

24060
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:35,471
does that make sense

24070
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,641
as a, as an application?

24080
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,041
KNIGHT: Yeah.

24090
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,576
And like perfectly segue

24100
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,945
into my next question actually.

24110
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,581
So so you talked about category theory

24120
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,551
as like a potential accounting system.

24130
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,052
And early

24140
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,420
on, actually,

24150
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,388
I think you even mentioned

24160
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,257
morality in your talk,

24170
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,124
but even before

24180
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,425
we were talking about intelligence

24190
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,262
and like grounding in ethics and wisdom

24200
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:03,032
and I'm now like internal studying,

24210
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,869
regenerative finance and potentially

24220
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,404
like new ways

24230
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,107
to develop like accounting systems

24240
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,141
that maybe involve

24250
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,409
like carbon credit

24260
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,945
or some kind of moral or ethical bound.

24270
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,948
KNIGHT: That's like a new system for like

24280
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,150
not just plus and minus dollars,

24290
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,819
but but maybe like a new system

24300
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:24,954
for accounting that

24310
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,123
like a ledger that that allows

24320
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,892
for more thoughtful consideration into

24330
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,194
sort of like the environment

24340
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,730
and just the world at large and humanity

24350
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,731
and our our faith

24360
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,800
and future as a species.

24370
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,534
And I just wonder

24380
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,236
if you've thought about that or

24390
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,270
and I definitely think like,

24400
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,705
you definitely think that category,

24410
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,907
you can maybe jump in and rescue us

24420
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,842
or just what are your thoughts on.

24430
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,078
SPIVAK: Yeah, so category theory,

24440
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,447
you have to do the work of deciding

24450
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,883
what your accounting system is concerns.

24460
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,785
It's like it helps you decide what

24470
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:56,719
what things

24480
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,523
since it is talked about all of math

24490
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,525
it can be written a category theory

24500
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,793
at this point

24510
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,530
or at least all that I can think of

24520
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,564
it's got

24530
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:09,031
all of

24540
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,499
math is the stuff that people have used

24550
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,134
so far to think about the world.

24560
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,337
SPIVAK: And so it's somehow getting all of that

24570
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,038
into a system.

24580
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,373
So it's likely that whatever

24590
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,908
we're thinking about now,

24600
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,310
if this were generated, finance, etc.,

24610
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,945
if you know,

24620
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,447
there would be some good way

24630
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:25,548
of putting it into category theory.

24640
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,615
But that's still has to be done.

24650
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,217
It won't rescue you, except

24660
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,719
it'll be there as like,

24670
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:30,920
yeah, I think I could.

24680
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,355
SPIVAK: If I had an expert to work with,

24690
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,389
I could do it.

24700
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,092
But then in terms of the question itself

24710
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,927
for generative finance and

24720
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,062
and that's and morality

24730
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,731
and stuff like that, well,

24740
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,264
I mean,

24750
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:42,565
I don't know

24760
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:43,165
if this is the sort of thing

24770
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:43,933
that comes to mind,

24780
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,102
but one thing I think in our society

24790
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,337
that might be pretty bad

24800
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,640
and is in ourselves also,

24810
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,341
or at least

24820
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,076
maybe it's good, but it's good in a way

24830
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,544
I don't understand yet.

24840
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:56,979
SPIVAK: And that is

24850
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,348
that in these big arrangements, there's

24860
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,851
little things whose job it is to hide

24870
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,854
the intentions of the things inside.

24880
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,222
And so,

24890
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,125
like, I think I'm not sure

24900
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,060
I'm going to name this person

24910
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,195
and it's almost a trigger, but

24920
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:14,964
Jeffrey Epstein,

24930
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,932
I think like, what was he good at?

24940
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,267
I kind of think I know

24950
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:18,667
he was known

24960
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,268
for like

24970
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,202
making these financial

24980
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,804
derivative instruments that like

24990
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:23,939
hid the, the,

25000
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:26,942
the subprime mortgage stuff.

25010
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,511
SPIVAK: And I feel like his whole island

25020
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,012
and all this stuff he was doing, like

25030
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:30,646
he just knew

25040
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,648
all the secrets and his

25050
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,650
and I could imagine

25060
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,418
backing away from him.

25070
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,453
But like also like the meat industry,

25080
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,821
there is secrets

25090
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,923
about how meat is produced.

25100
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,691
And when you go to the supermarket,

25110
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,193
their job is to make sure you don't

25120
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,828
think about that stuff.

25130
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,096
SPIVAK: And so

25140
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,198
when you form these big arrangements

25150
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,533
or the financial system

25160
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,300
like there's

25170
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,334
a lot of what goes on

25180
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,069
in the financial system

25190
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,870
that's hiding the

25200
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,771
almost slavery

25210
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,574
that takes place in various places.

25220
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,709
So and in myself,

25230
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,178
maybe the greed, I think all

25240
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,013
this is really coming from

25250
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,881
the need to survive

25260
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:06,649
at all costs

25270
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,516
or something like that,

25280
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:11,120
that it seems like our cells in our body

25290
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,456
SPIVAK: don't have. But we somehow have gotten.

25300
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,591
I'm not sure about that.

25310
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,826
So anyway, one thing that comes to

25320
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,127
mind is like,

25330
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,629
what's up with hiding intentions?

25340
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:26,502
And do is there any place for that?

25350
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:30,473
KNIGHT: Well, also, just like from

25360
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,675
from a very biological perspective,

25370
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,776
I do think that

25380
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,378
we have little things inside of us

25390
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,647
because not function.

25400
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:41,617
It is to hide things.

25410
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,053
But I definitely don't have access

25420
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:44,720
to that.

25430
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,821
The all of the knowledge

25440
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,390
of every single cell in my body

25450
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,793
or every even orgasm.

25460
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,895
So, so I mean, like

25470
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,697
survive at all costs.

25480
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:54,930
KNIGHT: Like,

25490
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,899
KNIGHT: yes, I could be like monogamous

25500
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,834
with going a little cancer

25510
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:02,004
tumor somewhere that's not known to me.

25520
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,173
And like we have mechanisms

25530
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:04,740
that mask

25540
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,242
pain and even mask

25550
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,544
like proprioception or so.

25560
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,379
So there's a lot of things going

25570
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,414
on, like there's a lot of hiding

25580
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,284
even in file in the biological system

25590
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,487
that happens between skills

25600
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,122
which totally leads

25610
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,458
into my next question so perfectly,

25620
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,760
which is about compression

25630
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,929
and elaboration.

25640
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:31,033
KNIGHT: And so like what is hidden

25650
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,670
or what is compressed, right?

25660
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,705
And what is the relationship

25670
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,341
or function or

25680
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,043
utility of category theory

25690
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,546
in elaborating compression

25700
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,481
and elaboration,

25710
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,650
like if I get the compressed version

25720
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,083
of like

25730
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,519
what the larger box container

25740
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,820
is, what's happening

25750
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,588
with the larger box?

25760
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:54,590
Can I elucidate the structure

25770
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,291
and what's happening

25780
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,892
in the smaller boxes

25790
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,160
or the even the arrangement

25800
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,529
of the smaller boxes in the within,

25810
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,830
the larger container,

25820
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,500
the larger scale, say

25830
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,768
and just so,

25840
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:08,437
so how much how good is this math?

25850
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,772
KNIGHT: Is it going to how

25860
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,140
how is it going to help me understand

25870
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,408
compression and elaboration

25880
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,742
across scales?

25890
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,078
SPIVAK: Yeah, cool.

25900
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:16,612
I first

25910
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,580
want to say that

25920
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,747
I think of category theory

25930
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,382
as humanity's

25940
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:24,153
best thought compression language.

25950
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:24,954
I didn't.

25960
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:25,621
Yeah.

25970
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,423
So for example, the category of

25980
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,124
polynomial functions is

25990
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,027
the whole

26000
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,062
subcategory function

26010
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,096
from set to set span

26020
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,165
by products of represented this.

26030
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,167
And I told you the entire definition

26040
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,969
and I don't expect you to understand it,

26050
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,737
and I wouldn't even expect of category

26060
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,172
theorists to understand it.

26070
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,540
SPIVAK: But I would write that expression

26080
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:44,940
that I just said

26090
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,941
on the board and would be,

26100
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,977
I don't know, 20 words or 30 words.

26110
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:50,779
And then

26120
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,114
that would be sitting there at the top.

26130
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,315
And then I would go through like,

26140
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,917
what do I mean by category?

26150
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,918
What do I mean by set?

26160
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,119
What I mean by filter?

26170
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,288
What do I mean by stand by?

26180
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,590
SPIVAK: What do I mean by co-product

26190
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,791
and what do I mean by represent?

26200
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:03,425
And I would go through

26210
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,194
those words

26220
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,195
and I would explain

26230
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,029
whichever ones of those

26240
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,197
who didn't understand,

26250
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:08,931
and then I would

26260
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,366
explain those in a compressed way.

26270
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:11,634
And then you'd say, Yeah, I get that.

26280
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:12,668
Or No, I don't get that.

26290
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,570
And we could unpack thing.

26300
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,939
So the category theory itself

26310
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,173
before we get to your question

26320
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,009
about the interfaces and arrangements

26330
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,610
is, is this amazing

26340
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,611
thought compression language

26350
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,647
where all the stuff in this talk,

26360
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,016
all the math behind it

26370
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,384
and the stuff is all

26380
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,520
it is an all in elaboration of of this

26390
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,222
very very compressed

26400
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,657
few words

26410
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,558
because we really made this language

26420
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,629
SPIVAK: for compressing big thoughts.

26430
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,598
Then there if I remember,

26440
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,333
I hope I'm not missing

26450
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,167
the main part of the question.

26460
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,403
But you were also talking about the

26470
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:48,404
arrangements themselves

26480
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,306
as compression and

26490
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,141
and yeah,

26500
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,943
like an outer circuit is a compression

26510
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,881
of a bunch of and or logic circuits

26520
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,149
that are themselves

26530
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,784
a compression of NAND gateway

26540
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:02,885
to themselves,

26550
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,286
transistors arranged in a certain way,

26560
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,587
a certain way, certain way.

26570
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,922
SPIVAK: And the NAND gate,

26580
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:07,523
if you think about it,

26590
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:08,190
why did you arrange

26600
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,725
those two transistors that way?

26610
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,327
Because you knew

26620
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,861
that it would always act this way.

26630
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:13,696
You can kind of like

26640
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,431
everyone's demanding

26650
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:16,832
all the time, but

26660
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,034
or is a pretty good thing to think about

26670
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:19,835
and and is a

26680
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:20,736
pretty good thing to think about

26690
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:22,171
and plus is pretty good.

26700
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,106
SPIVAK: And so these compressions,

26710
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,574
out of all the possible

26720
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,609
ways of arranging transistors

26730
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,211
into the number of transistors

26740
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:29,912
in the outer

26750
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,814
circuit that can add to

26760
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:32,548
three digit numbers

26770
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,782
or something like that,

26780
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:34,616
that might I don't know.

26790
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:35,718
Let's just pretend that took

26800
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,955
ten that took a thousand transistors.

26810
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,491
If I out of all the ways of arranging

26820
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,492
a thousand transistors,

26830
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,326
there's like a few

26840
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,328
that you would actually like

26850
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,396
that where you're like

26860
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,464
instead of two numbers

26870
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,598
and getting like some random thing,

26880
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,233
you get the actual sum.

26890
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,635
SPIVAK: And so we compress into for some reason

26900
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,437
some compressions are useful

26910
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,806
because we can predict them.

26920
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,208
And like I can kind of predict

26930
01:12:59,208 --> 01:12:59,708
your behavior

26940
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,542
based on what

26950
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,878
I'm seeing out on your face

26960
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,813
and, and what you need to know from me

26970
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,915
or what I can do to help and vice versa.

26980
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:07,950
And Like

26990
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,419
that ability to compress all this stuff

27000
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:11,253
into just something

27010
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:12,354
you output on

27020
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,023
the interface is is really important

27030
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,026
in the same is happening in the organ

27040
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:20,162
in the in the outer circuit and stuff.

27050
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,131
SPIVAK: So you kind of create things

27060
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:24,366
that have a well-defined usefulness,

27070
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:24,800
even though I have

27080
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,335
no idea what that means.

27090
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,238
And and I don't know,

27100
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,639
does that answer the question

27110
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,207
or did I miss a major part of it?

27120
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,413
KNIGHT: So let me just repeat a part of this.

27130
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:41,417
So if I am a compression, say like,

27140
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,785
let me just do something really simple.

27150
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,386
I'm the number six

27160
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:46,021
and I'm a compression of,

27170
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,323
you know, three numbers.

27180
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,591
And it can be.

27190
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,327
So can I, can I?

27200
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,363
I guess what I compress

27210
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,732
is the set of the possible numbers

27220
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,368
that make up six, like the three.

27230
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,436
KNIGHT: That's what I compress. Right.

27240
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,804
So that's what translates

27250
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,471
to the compression.

27260
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,540
So you can never really go

27270
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,374
from the compression

27280
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,341
number six, figure out

27290
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,744
which of those three numbers were right.

27300
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,078
SPIVAK: Right, right.

27310
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:13,081
But you can what you do know

27320
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,283
is the remaining

27330
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,553
thing that sickness gives you

27340
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,455
there's lots of things that use six

27350
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,690
and they're all happy to know about six

27360
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,359
and same with or like

27370
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,061
I don't know how you made your

27380
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:26,728
you could have made it

27390
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,530
with 43,000 transistors

27400
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,431
and wasted a bunch of them.

27410
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,033
But the point is

27420
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,068
I don't need to know all that stuff.

27430
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,002
SPIVAK: All I need to know

27440
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:34,970
is that this thing is going to take

27450
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,406
2 billion and produce a boolean

27460
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,509
in a certain way.

27470
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,643
And so the compression,

27480
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,645
this outer interface is saying,

27490
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,246
I don't care

27500
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,481
about all your private methods.

27510
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,281
Just tell me like,

27520
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:50,152
what can I expect from you?

27530
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,153
And I think part of like,

27540
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,321
you know, in our society

27550
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,555
we have identities.

27560
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:55,524
SPIVAK: I'm guessing that identity,

27570
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:56,558
which is such a major thing

27580
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,061
today, is like this compression

27590
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,330
of like what's expected from the person.

27600
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:02,631
And

27610
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,535
we, we are working out like

27620
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,104
how those identities really do help us

27630
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,941
expect things from each other.

27640
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,643
KNIGHT: So just on a topic of identity

27650
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,345
and like to follow up and maybe continue

27660
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,913
this train of thought a little bit.

27670
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,682
So like I am Bleu, I am a human.

27680
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,684
Like I'm a human that's alive,

27690
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,051
that's here.

27700
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,786
Talking under the compression

27710
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,955
of mass stream number 4.1,

27720
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,156
which all of this conversation

27730
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,791
will eventually confess to.

27740
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,361
Active Institute Mastering 4.1.

27750
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,096
KNIGHT: But, but like the fact that I am

27760
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,197
Bleu and I am human, like

27770
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,399
I am one among the set of many things

27780
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,167
that is all human.

27790
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,103
And like we describe the set,

27800
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,405
like living human in a certain way.

27810
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,074
Like I have a certain number of cells,

27820
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,310
but many of the cells are not human

27830
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,080
like so, so more so at some times your

27840
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,017
digestive cycle than others.

27850
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,985
KNIGHT: The more so sometimes are not human

27860
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,921
then actually are human.

27870
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:02,190
And so it's these set of like things,

27880
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,760
how many human cells, how many

27890
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,062
different E coli, so many

27900
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:09,565
different types of bacteria

27910
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,532
and microorganisms.

27920
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,099
And like

27930
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,000
all of these things

27940
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,468
compressed to the set of like

27950
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,203
living human,

27960
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,472
I would like to be able to unravel

27970
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:18,273
like, well,

27980
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,275
it is like go from living human or like

27990
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:20,943
you can just find

28000
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,744
the limits of like, okay,

28010
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,912
so now like too many E

28020
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,315
coli was like some decomposing human

28030
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:27,816
that's not alive.

28040
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,117
KNIGHT: So like, I would like to be able

28050
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:31,954
to really push the boundaries of what

28060
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,255
or even find

28070
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,456
the boundary of,

28080
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,159
of what makes the set of cells

28090
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,527
that is a living human versus

28100
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,728
like when do you

28110
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,730
it's like the phase transition,

28120
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,131
like the critical point.

28130
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,533
At what critical point

28140
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,568
are so many of these microorganisms

28150
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:47,502
alive that I become

28160
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,371
not a living human anymore?

28170
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,739
SPIVAK: Yeah. Yeah.

28180
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,907
So in the same way

28190
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,376
a an end gate is not made out of

28200
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,777
and gates

28210
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:56,878
it's made out of smaller

28220
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,714
things or, you know, a logic. Right.

28230
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,716
So we don't really expect

28240
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:01,483
the high level thing

28250
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,085
to be made out of little things.

28260
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:03,485
But the reason

28270
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,653
I think you're saying that there are

28280
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:05,821
these things called human cells

28290
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:09,024
is because we share this DNA and the DNA

28300
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:10,626
that you're tracking when you say there,

28310
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,327
hey, do you call, I is not me.

28320
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,062
SPIVAK: And the bacterial gut,

28330
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,531
gut bacteria stuff is not me

28340
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:18,834
because it doesn't have our

28350
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,268
DNA, but it is

28360
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:21,436
you in the sense that it helps

28370
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,171
you as a pattern exist.

28380
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:23,939
And so if I was putting

28390
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,040
an interface around you,

28400
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,341
I definitely wouldn't

28410
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,376
personally want to like

28420
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,777
only use your DNA cells

28430
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:29,411
and call those of you

28440
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,679
because I would be

28450
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:33,715
you wouldn't be a very good you.

28460
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,217
SPIVAK: But yeah.

28470
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:35,984
So what can happen

28480
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,319
is like these E coli

28490
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,120
or these cancers

28500
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,354
or whatever inside of you,

28510
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:43,125
let's say you're this gigantic of stuff,

28520
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,359
that what can happen

28530
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,495
is that they can start to say things

28540
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,064
that start to mess with that arrangement

28550
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,399
and start to change the arrangement.

28560
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:50,832
And so, remember,

28570
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,934
the arrangement is changing on

28580
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,469
what's flowing through the wires.

28590
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,471
SPIVAK: So your E coli things in there

28600
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,440
might be saying some stuff

28610
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,341
or spreading some stuff

28620
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,475
that's changing the arrangement.

28630
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,344
And now this cell is no longer

28640
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,413
talking about cell when it should have.

28650
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:05,380
And now that it's no longer

28660
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,815
talking to that cell

28670
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,250
because the arrangement has changed

28680
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,685
now it is now that other cell

28690
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,219
is not receiving what it usually does.

28700
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,121
SPIVAK: So it starts to say different things.

28710
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:15,190
And slowly this

28720
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,291
this changes the arrangement

28730
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,793
so much that you're no longer

28740
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,461
a coherent whole.

28750
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,562
And the things

28760
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:21,963
that we can expect from you

28770
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,632
your identity has changed to one

28780
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:30,072
that's like not as interesting.

28790
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:30,772
KNIGHT: Definitely.

28800
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,341
KNIGHT: And so can you see that in the

28810
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:34,409
with the math, like

28820
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,644
where this maybe

28830
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,112
phase transition

28840
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:37,679
takes place

28850
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,948
or like at what level of rearrangement,

28860
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,817
like maybe it's 20% rearrangement

28870
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:44,319
or like 20% coherent arrangement or

28880
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:45,921
measures like the

28890
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,923
information in the circuitry

28900
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,192
transferring from one to

28910
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,694
like from one piece to another such that

28920
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:53,762
like when the information flow

28930
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,730
is so disrupted,

28940
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,431
then it ceases to be

28950
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:57,933
a functional arrangement.

28960
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:00,335
SPIVAK: Yeah, I,

28970
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:01,837
I think that problem is as hard

28980
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:02,504
is like being able

28990
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,371
to look at a spreadsheet

29000
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,040
and seeing if there's corruption

29010
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,742
like people can do it.

29020
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,876
But it's a judgment.

29030
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:11,012
It's like someone decides, like, no,

29040
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,381
that's not, that's not real

29050
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,551
or yeah, it's like,

29060
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,120
I know it when I see it kind of thing.

29070
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,288
So there might be rules of thumb

29080
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,056
you could create

29090
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,592
in this accounting system like

29100
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,827
but I doubt

29110
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:29,131
I don't feel comfortable like the,

29120
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,700
the definition of the faith transition

29130
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,869
and I wouldn't expect it to be

29140
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:35,871
any more than

29150
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,107
a judgment, but yeah.

29160
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,208
KNIGHT: Well, thank you

29170
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,310
and thanks for letting me kind of ramble

29180
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,879
on a little bit there.

29190
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,648
So on the sidebar, we're here

29200
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,185
totally changing the subject.

29210
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,053
If you were a Roman,

29220
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,255
like if you were ancient

29230
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,156
Roman using

29240
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,024
ancient Roman numerals,

29250
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,226
would Hindi Arabic numerals

29260
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,228
still be empirically better

29270
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:02,330
or does that depend on context?

29280
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,932
SPIVAK: I think they would.

29290
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,601
I actually know that it might not be

29300
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:08,537
in the current culture,

29310
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,271
but I think

29320
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,307
I think it is just empirically better.

29330
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,709
Like in a sense,

29340
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,345
like is a better baseball player better?

29350
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:21,783
Well, they're better at baseball.

29360
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,285
Like, I'm not saying that's better.

29370
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,120
Like maybe you just love these things

29380
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,221
and it makes you feel really good

29390
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:27,322
to see cases and stuff.

29400
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,023
SPIVAK: And then for you,

29410
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,825
like it's great like you use this thing,

29420
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,494
but if you want to be a math person

29430
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,628
that multiplies things

29440
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:34,462
like you

29450
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,430
apparently in Rome,

29460
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,331
like if they were,

29470
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,232
they knew about square

29480
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,200
root of two back then.

29490
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,901
They figured out like

29500
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,037
1.41 for apparently. I don't know.

29510
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,938
I don't know if that's true.

29520
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:43,405
But they were

29530
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:45,106
Pythagoras was like back then like

29540
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,008
can you imagine

29550
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:47,742
taking square root

29560
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:50,078
if this is what you're using, it's just

29570
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,413
you can barely multiply like

29580
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,815
how could you take it to a power and do

29590
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,017
could we do quantum mechanics today

29600
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,953
if we were having to do this,

29610
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,654
could we do

29620
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,190
could we do even compound with this

29630
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,993
like I would never, ever want like

29640
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,028
so it just wins.

29650
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,363
Like it just

29660
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,431
it's empirically better

29670
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,000
because those who decide to move to

29680
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,269
this system will outcompete this.

29690
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,005
And in life

29700
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,608
there is some sort of competition

29710
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,176
and

29720
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,577
so I do think that

29730
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,512
it's empirically better,

29740
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,748
but I'm happy to hear if you disagree.

29750
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,751
KNIGHT: I mean, I do think like,

29760
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:30,051
you know,

29770
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,386
survival of the fittest, right?

29780
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,454
So so

29790
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:33,688
clearly like the Hindi

29800
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,224
Arabic numerals have have one.

29810
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,325
But but also

29820
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:37,893
I think

29830
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,661
that if I had never seen a Hindi Arabic

29840
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,962
numeral before

29850
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,964
and was trying to multiply that like

29860
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,199
I would first

29870
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:44,900
because it's like

29880
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,634
just one

29890
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:46,568
I'm familiar with, it's

29900
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,136
part of my model

29910
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,638
is to use these Roman numerals.

29920
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,273
KNIGHT: If I were in ancient Rome

29930
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:51,940
and I would be like,

29940
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,708
What is this one for? You know?

29950
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,110
And so it's just whatever,

29960
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,944
I guess that you're,

29970
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:56,645
you're familiar with.

29980
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,213
It's but but it's it's

29990
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,783
neat to hear your perspective also.

30000
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,286
SPIVAK: I mean, like if you were a moth

30010
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,688
and it was turning, you know, this

30020
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:07,989
everything was turning brown

30030
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:09,591
because of new smoke.

30040
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,625
You might be familiar

30050
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,660
with being a white moth,

30060
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,627
but like

30070
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,462
any moth that tends to being a brown

30080
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,931
moth would win.

30090
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:16,965
I don't know.

30100
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,033
Yeah, there's familiarity

30110
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,200
and that is a thing

30120
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,335
because we need that.

30130
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:21,670
We need homeostasis and stuff.

30140
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,572
SPIVAK: But there's I don't know.

30150
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,408
Yeah, I think that

30160
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:29,177
if someone was a more capable person

30170
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,379
in terms of being able to change,

30180
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,747
they would,

30190
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,417
they would appreciate that faculty

30200
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:36,451
themselves.

30210
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,520
Like they'd be like, I'm glad I tried

30220
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:41,756
to change.

30230
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:42,357
Yeah.

30240
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,727
KNIGHT: Well, and so now I have a series

30250
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,663
of questions about

30260
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:49,564
the interface

30270
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,232
and the dynamics and interactions.

30280
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:51,466
I don't know

30290
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,600
if you want to

30300
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,703
skip forward to the slides.

30310
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,738
So these are these like terms

30320
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:57,138
like you said,

30330
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:58,740
you have some key terms, interface

30340
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,677
dynamics, interaction, and I'm tracking

30350
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:05,313
these terms.

30360
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:05,814
Are they

30370
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,248
part of

30380
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:09,718
like the formalism of category theory?

30390
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:10,618
KNIGHT: Is this something that like

30400
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,721
everyone is a category they're studying,

30410
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,356
they're not. Okay.

30420
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,524
So that was my my question was,

30430
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,927
you know, because the way that you

30440
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:22,497
discussed these interfaces, positions

30450
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,933
versus states arrangements and closures

30460
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,903
really spoke to active inference so much

30470
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,039
like I really get why you're like,

30480
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,874
oh yeah, that seems to like kind of mesh

30490
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,943
with my current ideas.

30500
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:35,176
KNIGHT: Like,

30510
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,112
so like we have the interface

30520
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,681
which we talk about like

30530
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,282
a marcos blanket,

30540
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,184
like a separation of boundary

30550
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,886
and in the markup, like

30560
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,554
I like the sense states

30570
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,822
and the actual states.

30580
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,157
So like in the interface

30590
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,593
it is like you would call it positions

30600
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,228
and forces.

30610
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,796
Like that's where I act on the world

30620
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,331
and the world acts back on me.

30630
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,367
KNIGHT: Like in the Marcos boundary.

30640
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,369
And so similarly like talk

30650
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,171
about like the dynamics of the system

30660
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:04,272
as being hidden

30670
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,975
only like internal to the system.

30680
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,376
And we have like hidden states

30690
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,378
like our internal states.

30700
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,947
And then yeah, the interaction is like

30710
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,183
what I would refer to as like

30720
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:17,152
a state update, like, like

30730
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,087
so there's like, you know, we interact

30740
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,089
and then I might change or I might,

30750
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,590
it might just influence my

30760
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,491
future trajectory.

30770
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:24,893
KNIGHT: So I just wanted to

30780
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,628
highlight that the great degree

30790
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:27,362
of similarity

30800
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,497
between what you talked about

30810
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:30,532
and like what we talk

30820
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,133
about very regularly and actually

30830
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:33,568
inference is great.

30840
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,669
SPIVAK: So what I did was I took,

30850
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:35,670
I started noticing

30860
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,238
polynomial functions, wanted to do

30870
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,840
what I was trying to do

30880
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,075
and then

30890
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,677
I took the feeling of using them.

30900
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:43,344
Like when I

30910
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,513
the intuition I get by asking myself

30920
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:46,081
what a map

30930
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,015
of polynomial functions

30940
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,416
is or whatever,

30950
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,318
and came up with these words

30960
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:52,754
as the things that most

30970
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,022
like most intuitive

30980
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:54,889
English words

30990
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:55,790
that tracked

31000
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,792
how the math was was changing

31010
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,227
or how the math

31020
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,562
developed as I

31030
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,464
made a story about these things.

31040
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,865
SPIVAK: So these are really just the words

31050
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,267
that I found to most.

31060
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,103
Give me intuition for tracking

31070
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,104
what the math was

31080
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:13,408
was doing automatically.

31090
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,275
It looks like Daniel

31100
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,643
has his hand raised.

31110
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,980
FRIEDMAN: I think you just great

31120
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,615
questions Bleu and David

31130
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,350
thanks for the very

31140
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,785
powerful and creative talk.

31150
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,352
I think

31160
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,088
on this topic of the active inference

31170
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,058
ontology mapping,

31180
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,026
I think that was really quite

31190
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,128
well stated,

31200
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,062
which is

31210
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,831
this idea of an input output system

31220
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,835
or an interface and things that are on

31230
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,270
one side of the interface

31240
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:42,971
are shielded

31250
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:43,838
from that

31260
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,340
on the other side of the interface.

31270
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,574
FRIEDMAN: Otherwise quite literally

31280
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,443
it would be a different thing

31290
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:49,711
is a really powerful idea

31300
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:51,880
and it comes up in computer science

31310
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,181
with APIs,

31320
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:56,217
it comes up in graphs and topology,

31330
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:58,520
and we can even think about things

31340
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,622
like the arithmetic operations,

31350
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,357
like of operations

31360
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:03,558
or nested parentheses.

31370
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:03,992
It's like, well,

31380
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,793
what happens in the parentheses?

31390
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:07,028
It stays in the parentheses

31400
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,830
until it's compressed

31410
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,766
and then it goes into some other area.

31420
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,902
FRIEDMAN: And then also even how you described

31430
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:16,237
searching for intuitive words

31440
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:17,438
and I'm sure actively

31450
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:21,276
inferring with many learners for terms

31460
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:24,546
have a natural interpretation

31470
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,582
or a conversational interpretation

31480
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,052
and also point towards more technical

31490
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,622
usage, which I think in active inference

31500
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:37,825
we see a lot about system delineation

31510
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,494
and partitioning from the environment

31520
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,496
like such as the ones that brought up

31530
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,998
nested systems and interacting systems.

31540
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,700
FRIEDMAN: And also

31550
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,403
regarding some numerical quantities

31560
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,272
like surprise attention and so on.

31570
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:55,443
Although also we have recently seen

31580
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,145
some symbolic active

31590
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:59,180
inference implementations

31600
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,982
from JF cluster

31610
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,818
that are engaging in this action

31620
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,286
perception loop

31630
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,121
without sending statistical

31640
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,856
or numerical messages,

31650
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:09,624
but rather

31660
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:12,260
communicating about logic values.

31670
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,363
So I just wanted to note that and

31680
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:17,765
if you have any thoughts

31690
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:18,833
otherwise, I'll read a question

31700
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,636
from the chat. Um, yeah.

31710
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:22,203
A quick

31720
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:24,005
thought is like somehow

31730
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:24,739
when I

31740
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,908
we take language, for example, math,

31750
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,712
and we translate it into motion.

31760
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:33,214
So like if you say please pass the salt,

31770
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:34,949
then like 10 to 15

31780
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,118
atoms will move through space.

31790
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:37,352
You know,

31800
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:39,153
you say this word in language

31810
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:40,355
and in ten to the 15 atoms

31820
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,389
move through space

31830
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,524
and like some salt crystals land on your

31840
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:46,160
on your food or whatever.

31850
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:47,262
SPIVAK: And so

31860
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,331
by having the math

31870
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,799
into intuitive ideas

31880
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,401
in our in our minds,

31890
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,403
we can then take the mathematical ideas

31900
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,237
and translate them

31910
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,238
into the movement of atoms.

31920
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,007
So like me being able to talk or,

31930
01:27:59,007 --> 01:27:59,941
or whatever

31940
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:00,341
and like

31950
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:01,209
it's really important

31960
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:02,377
that we have intuitive ways

31970
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:03,344
of thinking about these things

31980
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:04,379
because otherwise

31990
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:05,680
they won't translate down

32000
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,814
into the movement of atoms

32010
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:07,749
that actually the action

32020
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,351
that we see in the world, that actually

32030
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:11,986
accomplishes anything.

32040
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:12,987
So I'm

32050
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,689
SPIVAK: I'm worried about all the mathematicians

32060
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:15,790
that are doing math

32070
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,492
that they don't have any sense at all

32080
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,661
about how it could ever be used.

32090
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,095
And this is kind of the point of Tobias

32100
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,597
Institute is like

32110
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,399
you can I don't mind if you do it

32120
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:25,633
like okay, you can do whatever you want.

32130
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:26,401
But like

32140
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,269
I don't see a point in doing math

32150
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:30,938
if you no idea how that would ever

32160
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:33,241
be useful to anyone

32170
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,009
even in a thousand years.

32180
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:36,544
SPIVAK: And so I'm,

32190
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,279
I don't know so yeah to connect

32200
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,213
the point is like to

32210
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:39,714
to connect

32220
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,249
with the audience here

32230
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,150
have this possibly

32240
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,018
be useful to anyone for real.

32250
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,453
I need to find the words

32260
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:46,821
that take the math

32270
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,656
and translate it into intuitive concepts

32280
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:49,924
so that they can come back

32290
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:50,725
to the math that they

32300
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:51,693
want to or whatever.

32310
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:57,031
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, Lou, anything to add

32320
01:28:57,031 --> 01:29:01,269
on it?

32330
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:03,971
KNIGHT: Go ahead and read the chat questions.

32340
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:04,572
Great.

32350
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:05,473
SPIVAK: All right.

32360
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:06,441
FRIEDMAN: So this will

32370
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:06,841
pull us

32380
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,209
back, generalize a little bit,

32390
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:08,609
and then I'm

32400
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:09,444
sure we could

32410
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:10,044
talk more

32420
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:13,047
active inference or institute talk.

32430
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,250
So Ali wrote

32440
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,152
it is said that category theory is,

32450
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:19,420
the most abstract

32460
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,490
area of mathematics out there, perhaps

32470
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,524
we can even call it

32480
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,727
a kind of meta mathematics.

32490
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:26,828
Daniel Dennett

32500
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:28,730
claims in intuition

32510
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,531
and other tools for thinking

32520
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,833
that we can theoretically

32530
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,002
go meta on every level of abstraction.

32540
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:38,906
FRIEDMAN: So is it possible to conceive a level

32550
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:39,841
of abstraction

32560
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,442
even more meta

32570
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,745
than category theory in mathematics?

32580
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,614
SPIVAK: Yeah, great question.

32590
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:47,982
So

32600
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,686
there is a category of all categories.

32610
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,122
There is.

32620
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:54,956
The thing is that

32630
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:55,623
when you have a category

32640
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:56,824
of all categories,

32650
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,659
first of all, it's like

32660
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,895
really big and second of all,

32670
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:02,597
it has an

32680
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,499
even higher level structure

32690
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:06,100
that than each category does.

32700
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,968
So it's called a two

32710
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:08,736
category of all categories.

32720
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,171
And then there's a three category

32730
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:11,773
about two categories.

32740
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:14,108
SPIVAK: And but there is amazingly

32750
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,810
a thing called infinity categories

32760
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,011
that finishes this thing

32770
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,713
where there is an infinity category

32780
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:20,081
of all infinity categories.

32790
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,649
And I think

32800
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,484
I think that that the abstract

32810
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:24,152
like is very hard

32820
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,720
to think about this thing,

32830
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,789
but it is still an active area

32840
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,490
of, of research

32850
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,026
to create like a nice infinity category.

32860
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,163
But the but yeah, people

32870
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:37,098
keep getting stuck on, hey,

32880
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:37,999
I've got this category,

32890
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,100
I've got all these categories

32900
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,134
and I want something more abstract

32910
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:41,536
and then I need a two category

32920
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,537
and I'm done.

32930
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,304
SPIVAK: I got the

32940
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,273
two category of all categories,

32950
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,507
but then eventually someone

32960
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:47,942
the next one. And so

32970
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,311
so yeah, this is

32980
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:51,245
this is a great question.

32990
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:52,680
It is an active area of research

33000
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,983
right now. Okay.

33010
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,151
Interesting.

33020
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,786
I'll ask one

33030
01:30:58,786 --> 01:30:59,821
active inference

33040
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:01,222
related question that connects

33050
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:03,291
also to enclosures and nesting.

33060
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:07,562
So we've in the generative models

33070
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,530
that we see in active inference,

33080
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,765
they're Bayesian graphs

33090
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:12,200
and they're describing control

33100
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,001
systems and action perception loops

33110
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,403
and so on.

33120
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:18,806
We've seen nested models be used

33130
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:21,542
in at least two different ways.

33140
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:24,312
One is to describe systems

33150
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:26,113
who are physically nested

33160
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:29,317
within one another, such as an organism,

33170
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:30,518
and then the organs,

33180
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,053
the cells, the organelles

33190
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,188
and those interfaces and.

33200
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,591
FRIEDMAN: What that nesting or enclosing

33210
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,092
can be interpreted

33220
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:42,063
as has a natural spatial interpretation.

33230
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:44,899
However, there have also been

33240
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,501
nested models

33250
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,904
of cognitive modeling flavors,

33260
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,274
and in those cases it's never been clear

33270
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:55,276
whether the nesting or enclosing

33280
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:56,644
that's happening

33290
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:58,880
is reflecting spatial boundaries

33300
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,148
in some cognitive space.

33310
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:02,550
If one chooses that

33320
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,918
direction of interpretation

33330
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,320
or in fact what that nesting entails,

33340
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,856
and then importantly why it would have

33350
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,992
a structural ice amorphous m

33360
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:13,861
with the nesting of the matryoshka

33370
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:14,629
and just things

33380
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:15,329
that are physically

33390
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:16,831
nested inside of each other.

33400
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:20,101
FRIEDMAN: So what does nesting and enclosure

33410
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:21,602
mean here,

33420
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:21,936
and is it

33430
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:24,272
referring to spatial boundaries?

33440
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:25,806
Other conceptual boundaries.

33450
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:27,008
SPIVAK: Yeah.

33460
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,109
Great. So

33470
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:30,211
this so

33480
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,113
like same with airplanes or something.

33490
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,180
We have the physical airplane,

33500
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,081
but then

33510
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,349
different parts of the airplane

33520
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:36,384
are really talking to each other.

33530
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,218
That may not be like

33540
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,052
the radio

33550
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:38,920
of the control tower

33560
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,821
and the radio of the airplane

33570
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:41,889
are in some sense

33580
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,457
more closely connected than.

33590
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,725
The radio of the airplane

33600
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,861
and the engine of the airplane,

33610
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,230
the the radio,

33620
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:49,664
the airplane

33630
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,264
and the radio

33640
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:53,968
and the pilot are strongly connected.

33650
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:54,502
SPIVAK: And so, yeah,

33660
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,337
there's always this logical,

33670
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:58,306
what I would call physical arrangement

33680
01:32:58,306 --> 01:32:59,874
and logical arrangement,

33690
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,376
and those might be different.

33700
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:05,746
But what are from this point of view

33710
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:08,382
or one thing you could do is just

33720
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,184
so if you if you look at,

33730
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,352
I don't know, this x one,

33740
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:12,553
two and X two, one,

33750
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:13,688
you might imagine that there's

33760
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,022
a logical way of arranging things

33770
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,157
where these really seem like

33780
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,426
they're quite close. And so

33790
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:23,965
I probably

33800
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:24,599
should have shown this,

33810
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,666
but that picture

33820
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,602
is the same as this one.

33830
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:30,871
I've just undone the nesting.

33840
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:34,442
Let's see if I can kind of show that.

33850
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,510
So yeah, let's see. This is.

33860
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,945
Oh, no, it's not.

33870
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:39,513
Oh, darn it.

33880
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:40,748
I didn't take the same one.

33890
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:42,149
It's confusing.

33900
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:43,317
Okay, well,

33910
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:44,385
I think I added an extra

33920
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:48,356
loop on this thing or something.

33930
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:49,223
SPIVAK: Anyway, my point is,

33940
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:52,460
we can undo this nesting and have it be

33950
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:53,527
have this one

33960
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:54,362
be closer to this one

33970
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,931
in some other nesting.

33980
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,232
So you could use

33990
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,734
this organizational system

34000
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:00,968
called an operator

34010
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:01,869
to handle the fact

34020
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:02,470
that you might want to

34030
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,970
nest things

34040
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:06,340
differently for different purposes.

34050
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,309
This picture here is supposed to be

34060
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,111
either physical arrangement

34070
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:11,612
or logical arrangement.

34080
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:12,246
SPIVAK: It doesn't matter.

34090
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:14,382
And it's really just

34100
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,050
about who's talking to who.

34110
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,518
That's the most important thing.

34120
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:18,719
The thing is that in your liver

34130
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,087
or in your brain, in your cell,

34140
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,122
maybe

34150
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:22,657
the latency of communication

34160
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:23,758
is much greater

34170
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:28,763
than across the boundaries.

34180
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,031
Sorry for the

34190
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:31,899
voice issue.

34200
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:34,168
FRIEDMAN: Well, very interesting.

34210
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,403
And in neuroscience

34220
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:36,737
speaks to the distinctions

34230
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:38,973
of structural, functional

34240
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,509
and affective connectivity, which

34250
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:43,911
if only it was dominoes

34260
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:44,679
hitting each other

34270
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,213
and they were all identical.

34280
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:47,481
But even in that case,

34290
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:49,083
I don't think they would be identical.

34300
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,418
So we're dealing with something

34310
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,552
and that's a great example

34320
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:52,887
where the informational

34330
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,889
and the causal connectivity,

34340
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,190
after all the Bayesian

34350
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,292
causal graph architecture

34360
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:00,061
is pointing towards

34370
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:01,862
something that is presenting itself

34380
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:03,030
as cause

34390
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,433
with a technical specific definition,

34400
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:07,401
although a natural word.

34410
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:08,569
FRIEDMAN: And so it is interesting

34420
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:11,205
when the causal architecture

34430
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,473
may not reflect

34440
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,075
the physical architecture

34450
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:16,610
and vice versa. Right.

34460
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,611
And that's the opera

34470
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:18,579
and the notion of opera,

34480
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:20,047
which I never said during the talk. But

34490
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,551
this nesting thing is

34500
01:35:24,852 --> 01:35:27,054
is designed to allow you to rearrange

34510
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,556
how you want to consider

34520
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,490
inside and outside,

34530
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:30,091
or whether you want to

34540
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:32,259
consider physical or logical

34550
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:33,661
to allow you to do that

34560
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:35,296
zooming on your own time

34570
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:37,231
or you're in your own way

34580
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:38,132
without affecting

34590
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:38,733
what the thing

34600
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:42,870
is going to do as a whole.

34610
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,171
FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Bleu.

34620
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:48,342
KNIGHT: So just to add on to the possible

34630
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:49,710
layers of nesting,

34640
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:50,644
there's also the layer

34650
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:52,413
of temporal nesting, right?

34660
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,182
So things happen at a very fast pace

34670
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:56,183
that we don't observe,

34680
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:57,184
like delay the slip

34690
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,185
flickering as long

34700
01:35:58,185 --> 01:35:59,820
as it's greater than 60 hertz.

34710
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,122
I don't see it flickering,

34720
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,023
but I know flickering.

34730
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:04,291
As long as it's

34740
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,627
not in my perceptible range,

34750
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:09,163
then it doesn't really matter to me. So.

34760
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:09,663
KNIGHT: So there's

34770
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:11,699
and just

34780
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:12,566
similarly,

34790
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:15,035
I don't think biological evolution

34800
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,170
maybe cares

34810
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:19,306
all that much about mastering 4.1,

34820
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:21,208
but cares about like how many children

34830
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:21,809
we each have

34840
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,211
and all these other things, right?

34850
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:27,481
So that, that the, the relevance,

34860
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:28,282
the salience

34870
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:31,018
and across temporal scales is also

34880
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:34,121
something to think about.

34890
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:35,222
And we talked about

34900
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:36,524
like the changing interface,

34910
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:38,559
I think you mentioned that

34920
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:41,662
and with with the question of like

34930
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:42,029
I don't know

34940
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:42,797
if active inference

34950
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,065
does this changing interface also

34960
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:48,302
it does in the mark of which

34970
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,570
we just actually learned

34980
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:50,171
about and talked about

34990
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:50,738
when we were talking

35000
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:53,941
about quantum systems with Chris

35010
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,544
and Mike and John.

35020
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:57,845
KNIGHT: So that was

35030
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,548
KNIGHT: I think livestream number 40.

35040
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,717
FRIEDMAN: Also on on that technical

35050
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:03,984
note,

35060
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:04,718
I would suggest

35070
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:06,954
that the plain essence

35080
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:07,855
of the blanket

35090
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,857
definition does not entail

35100
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,626
any sort of dynamical rearrangement.

35110
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,796
However, recent work by Dalton s

35120
01:37:15,863 --> 01:37:16,831
and others

35130
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:17,631
has pointed

35140
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:20,000
towards a definition of a blanket index

35150
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:23,370
which reflects a weekly mixing dynamical

35160
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:26,106
interface zone

35170
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,142
that is on a 0 to 1 continuum

35180
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,211
and that may point towards

35190
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,279
the kind of rearrange of all interfaces,

35200
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,481
although not with the kind of

35210
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,885
category theoretic nature.

35220
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:39,720
FRIEDMAN: As far as I know.

35230
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,321
But again,

35240
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:43,157
this is like a very interesting area

35250
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,161
and I can see many applications

35260
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:48,128
in systems

35270
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:50,631
including online teams and organization.

35280
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:51,932
And so I really like that.

35290
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:54,535
You used what was that Hans

35300
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:56,937
and I

35310
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,940
for making some of these connections

35320
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:06,113
clear, cool.

35330
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:08,182
KNIGHT: And just just one last connection.

35340
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,651
You had mentioned your applied

35350
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:14,989
to apply the tools

35360
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:16,023
that you're facing right now

35370
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,792
and you mentioned prediction markets.

35380
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,762
And I do think that.

35390
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:22,496
Well well,

35400
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,698
first of all, you talked about like

35410
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:25,799
before you talked about that

35420
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,301
you talked about the free energy

35430
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:28,669
minimizes

35440
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:28,903
sort of

35450
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,704
each little component in the system

35460
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:32,406
is the free energy minimizing

35470
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,674
and how like it

35480
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:34,708
within the FP

35490
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,476
it can

35500
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:37,578
scale to form like a container

35510
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,312
free energy

35520
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:39,880
for energy minimize it

35530
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,549
so yes and that will stay a free energy.

35540
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,018
KNIGHT: The free energy minimize

35550
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,920
as long as it decreases

35560
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,721
the free energy of all of the components

35570
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:48,756
in the container

35580
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,591
for it to stay in container. Right.

35590
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,459
So that's that speaks self-assembly

35600
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:53,727
and perhaps of the genesis.

35610
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:57,598
And then in these

35620
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:57,998
so again,

35630
01:38:57,998 --> 01:38:59,600
consider how free energy minimizes

35640
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,968
the range themselves. There we go.

35650
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:01,502
And how

35660
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:02,770
constitute a larger scale

35670
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,604
free energy minimize

35680
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,673
or if it lowers the free energy?

35690
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:08,042
KNIGHT: And then just in terms of application

35700
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,109
prediction markets,

35710
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:12,179
I think is a really good way to

35720
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:13,414
maybe align

35730
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:15,416
category theory with the FCP.

35740
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,585
And I think some of that has been done.

35750
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:22,222
I want to say like the multi arm band it

35760
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,358
problem is maybe like

35770
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:26,460
like a rudimentary example of that

35780
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,127
and I don't remember

35790
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:28,262
which livestream that was.

35800
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,463
KNIGHT: It was a long time ago,

35810
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:32,366
but we did have a paper

35820
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,934
dealing with the multi band

35830
01:39:33,934 --> 01:39:36,270
the problem and using that to solve it.

35840
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:36,937
And that might be

35850
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:38,305
a way to start to learn like.

35860
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:41,642
FRIEDMAN: On the

35870
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:43,744
just on the prediction market area.

35880
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,212
And then, David, really curious to hear

35890
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:46,447
what you think.

35900
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,015
I see a lot of parallels with what

35910
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:50,551
you described about transistors.

35920
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:50,985
Again,

35930
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:53,020
you said a thousand pieces components

35940
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,355
in this transistor.

35950
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:56,857
The space of the a thousand pick

35960
01:39:57,224 --> 01:40:00,294
and connections might be vast.

35970
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:01,095
And so that's where

35980
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,529
like selective processes

35990
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:03,731
and abduct of logic

36000
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:05,132
come into play with this

36010
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,501
two stroke engine of like diversifying

36020
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:09,737
and exploring the space and pruning down

36030
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:11,238
based upon function.

36040
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:12,339
FRIEDMAN: And so we could imagine

36050
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:13,674
prediction markets

36060
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,243
where the next mate level

36070
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:18,946
the the the colony participants

36080
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,581
is making great predictions,

36090
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,882
but then they're being compiled

36100
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:24,184
in a way that's actually inadequate.

36110
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:26,720
We could also imagine the other extreme

36120
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,455
where no nest mate knows

36130
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:30,090
how much food the colony has or what

36140
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,393
the weather is outside, etc.

36150
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:34,561
But it's natural actions

36160
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:36,096
still participate

36170
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:38,399
in a colony or in a market

36180
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:40,434
that makes adaptive decisions.

36190
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:42,403
FRIEDMAN: So in that structuring

36200
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:44,471
of multi-scale sense, making

36210
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:47,341
the composability

36220
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:50,344
and the ability to create systems

36230
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:53,414
that are valid across scales

36240
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:56,583
and don't enforce any kind of

36250
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:01,088
implausible constraints,

36260
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,157
it becomes essential because

36270
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:03,991
people point

36280
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,559
sometimes to wisdom of crowds

36290
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,761
and all these other related areas,

36300
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:09,663
and there's probably some areas

36310
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,631
and some ways of doing it

36320
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:12,833
that are just incredibly effective.

36330
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,335
FRIEDMAN: And I'm sure we can think of

36340
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:16,837
crowds and ways of doing it

36350
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:17,971
and questions

36360
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:20,207
where it is just not that way.

36370
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:21,575
SPIVAK: Yeah.

36380
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,178
SPIVAK: So in this in this work of unknown

36390
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:27,314
dynamic organizational structures,

36400
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:28,482
there is a kind of fractal

36410
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:30,684
like nature to it where the same thing,

36420
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:31,752
like there's one formula

36430
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,187
for the whole thing.

36440
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:35,422
And so in order to be

36450
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:37,958
one of these things

36460
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:40,861
like in this technical sense that we

36470
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:41,762
wrote up,

36480
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:44,364
it can have all sorts of crazy stuff

36490
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:45,232
at one level that doesn't

36500
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:48,035
exist at no level like we.

36510
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,471
SPIVAK: This is not supposed to be

36520
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:51,371
an indictment of it.

36530
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,407
But we tried to make a more socialist

36540
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:55,976
example of a trick prediction market

36550
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:58,011
where the wealth of, the

36560
01:41:58,445 --> 01:41:59,613
the updated wealth

36570
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:03,350
would be more evenly distributed.

36580
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:06,420
And it wasn't like it didn't

36590
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,488
it didn't have fractal

36600
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:09,022
like property where

36610
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:09,756
what would happening

36620
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:10,791
at the high level

36630
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:11,558
with coherence

36640
01:42:11,558 --> 01:42:13,427
with what was happening to low level

36650
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:14,495
and so it could have been

36660
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,529
because we weren't

36670
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:17,798
we were creative enough or whatever.

36680
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,767
SPIVAK: But my main point is that there are

36690
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:22,302
there are rules to this system

36700
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:23,971
that say when it's

36710
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,339
going to kind of

36720
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:27,674
align across the entire structure.

36730
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:29,042
And when it does,

36740
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:30,944
then you get a very short description

36750
01:42:30,944 --> 01:42:32,980
that that happens at all scales.

36760
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,382
And so

36770
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:38,485
what what this kind of tracking system

36780
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,854
allows is to say,

36790
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:41,855
I mean, you don't have to trust

36800
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:43,390
that dynamic organizational structures

36810
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:44,725
are a good system.

36820
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:46,426
SPIVAK: But if you were like, well, we need some

36830
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,061
something to guide us here,

36840
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:50,597
then you could use it to say,

36850
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,866
Well, this way of assembling predictions

36860
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:53,934
to make our little prediction

36870
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:54,968
just doesn't work

36880
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:57,171
as one of these dynamic

36890
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,138
organizational structures.

36900
01:42:58,138 --> 01:42:59,072
And therefore,

36910
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,607
we're going to deny it

36920
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:02,109
as the way we're going to do stuff

36930
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:03,544
because they're just not going to work

36940
01:43:03,544 --> 01:43:07,514
when we do multi-scale things.

36950
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,615
SPIVAK: These four examples

36960
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:12,152
do so in heavy learning.

36970
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:12,986
For example, what we

36980
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:13,620
what we mean by

36990
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,388
that is

37000
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:15,422
spike time

37010
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:16,590
dependent plasticity

37020
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:19,760
where like what happens if, if I hear

37030
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,029
you say the same kind of balance

37040
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:25,132
as, as me, but you said it like 1/2 ago,

37050
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:25,999
whereas I'm saying it

37060
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:27,367
now, then,

37070
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,402
then I want to wire to

37080
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:29,536
you more strongly.

37090
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,505
SPIVAK: So this kind of, like just

37100
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:33,440
this kind of time horizon where

37110
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,841
I'm listening for your

37120
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:36,109
your agreement with me

37130
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:37,277
and if you did before me

37140
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,745
that I want to wire to you more

37150
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:39,513
that itself.

37160
01:43:39,513 --> 01:43:41,782
There is a way putting this together

37170
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,050
that has this kind of fractal

37180
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:43,984
like structure,

37190
01:43:43,984 --> 01:43:45,185
but there's tons of ways of doing it

37200
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:46,053
that don't.

37210
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:47,454
SPIVAK: And so that that's kind of

37220
01:43:47,454 --> 01:43:48,422
what's going on here.

37230
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:51,625
FRIEDMAN: In in what you

37240
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:52,392
just said with

37250
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,628
a short description across scales.

37260
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:58,232
I see it reflected in that definition.

37270
01:43:58,232 --> 01:43:59,900
You wrote up on the chalkboard

37280
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,768
that could be uncompressed

37290
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:04,371
and in Pass the salt

37300
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,640
or pass the salt, please.

37310
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,843
And then in the organizational setting,

37320
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:11,878
that kind of multi-scale decision

37330
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:13,981
making and ability to address

37340
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:16,950
a kind of integrated

37350
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:20,053
stack of scales

37360
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:21,488
such that

37370
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:23,523
there is a compression

37380
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:25,993
like I am running,

37390
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:27,527
which is describing

37400
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:30,130
a coherent set of actions

37410
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,431
ranging all the way down

37420
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,734
to the, to the cellular and molecular

37430
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:37,170
that can be semantically compressed

37440
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,273
in a verbal or linguistic community

37450
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:40,774
in a certain way.

37460
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:41,608
FRIEDMAN: And there's other people

37470
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:43,176
who you say, I'm running

37480
01:44:43,176 --> 01:44:44,144
and they're going to look at you like,

37490
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:45,646
What language are you speaking?

37500
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:47,581
So it still is contextual, yet

37510
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:48,715
we can have these

37520
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,751
multi-scale or descriptions.

37530
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:52,719
And then

37540
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,689
I have a note from Kevin in the chat

37550
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:57,024
in case it hasn't been noted,

37560
01:44:57,024 --> 01:44:59,192
it might be worth mentioning to David

37570
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,961
that Markov blankets

37580
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:01,828
in active inference

37590
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:03,630
are just a kind of Bayesian network

37600
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,965
directed acyclic graphs

37610
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:05,766
with probabilities

37620
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,167
assigned to the vertices

37630
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:07,801
for all those

37640
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,936
who will be following this trail

37650
01:45:09,936 --> 01:45:13,640
and working to build this relationship,

37660
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,776
hopefully between category

37670
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,943
theory and active inference.

37680
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:18,879
FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Kevin.

37690
01:45:18,879 --> 01:45:19,279
SPIVAK: Cool.

37700
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,383
Thanks.

37710
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:24,418
KNIGHT: So very cool.

37720
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:26,253
I think we're coming up on time.

37730
01:45:26,253 --> 01:45:26,653
David,

37740
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:27,421
do you want to tell us

37750
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:28,855
maybe a little bit about

37760
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:30,057
or if we have any questions first

37770
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,159
that we would happy to

37780
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,761
maybe attempt to elaborate?

37790
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:35,529
Or also,

37800
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:36,296
if you want to tell us

37810
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:36,697
a little bit

37820
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:38,065
about this institute

37830
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:40,600
and what your goal and function are,

37840
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,537
how you came to, you know, self-assemble

37850
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:46,306
in that form. That would be great.

37860
01:45:46,306 --> 01:45:46,640
Sure.

37870
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,109
Yeah.

37880
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:52,012
Basically, in in academia, there is no

37890
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,115
I my co-founder

37900
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:57,050
Brendan and I wrote a textbook.

37910
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,785
There is no interest in

37920
01:45:58,785 --> 01:45:59,820
writing in academia.

37930
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,121
I especially like to help people

37940
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:02,923
learn a new subject.

37950
01:46:02,923 --> 01:46:04,591
There's no reward for it.

37960
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:06,727
There's no reward in the math

37970
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:09,196
for making tools out of the math

37980
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:10,630
or trying to help people

37990
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,232
either learn it or use it.

38000
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:13,967
And so

38010
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:16,103
basically I'd been at MIT

38020
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:17,037
for eight years

38030
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:19,639
and then my department said,

38040
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:20,841
We now have a new policy

38050
01:46:20,841 --> 01:46:22,843
that you can only be here five years

38060
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:23,677
if you don't have tenure.

38070
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:24,511
And I didn't have tenure.

38080
01:46:24,511 --> 01:46:25,946
I was a research scientist.

38090
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:26,880
And so he gave me a two

38100
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,883
and a half years to two go.

38110
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,252
And so

38120
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,588
I was like, Well, okay,

38130
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,289
that makes sense because academia

38140
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:37,891
doesn't care about, you know,

38150
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:39,459
about the

38160
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:41,161
stuff that I'm really trying to do.

38170
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,430
And so Brendan and I made institute

38180
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,731
because we actually want

38190
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:46,533
the stuff we're doing to help the world

38200
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:48,668
make more sense of things like we are

38210
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:49,636
this gigantic,

38220
01:46:49,636 --> 01:46:50,137
you know, we've,

38230
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:50,637
we've,

38240
01:46:50,637 --> 01:46:51,772
we're a network of people

38250
01:46:51,772 --> 01:46:53,940
that the world that has to steer

38260
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:54,841
it has to decide is

38270
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:55,776
climate change really?

38280
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:58,512
You know, is is Obama a muslim?

38290
01:46:58,512 --> 01:46:59,646
We don't know these answers.

38300
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:00,480
Apparently, we don't

38310
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,349
we can't figure these things out.

38320
01:47:02,349 --> 01:47:03,049
And that just

38330
01:47:03,049 --> 01:47:03,550
I think it's

38340
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:04,951
because we don't have the communication

38350
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:08,288
to to to to do that.

38360
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,191
And so I just want like

38370
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:13,360
I think there's just it's not because

38380
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,227
I think there is this

38390
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:16,096
greed thing in everyone

38400
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,098
or this need to survive or whatever

38410
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:18,398
it is.

38420
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:19,466
It's hiding of information

38430
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,135
that is probably causing problems.

38440
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:23,203
And I don't really understand it.

38450
01:47:23,203 --> 01:47:23,904
And you're right, like

38460
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:24,337
we don't need

38470
01:47:24,337 --> 01:47:26,239
everything out in the open.

38480
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,108
But mostly I think what's really causing

38490
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:30,544
problems is just lack of communication.

38500
01:47:30,544 --> 01:47:31,711
It's like my greed.

38510
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,446
If I understood

38520
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:33,780
how it was affecting you,

38530
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,748
maybe I wouldn't

38540
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:36,550
need to do this particular one.

38550
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,050
And like,

38560
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,918
if you understood

38570
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:38,685
how the scientists

38580
01:47:38,685 --> 01:47:40,987
came to the idea of climate change

38590
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:42,622
and you could track

38600
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,058
track that to the level you want it to,

38610
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:45,692
you could

38620
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:47,594
actually, you

38630
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:48,829
know, understand these things.

38640
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:50,464
Then maybe you wouldn't question it.

38650
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:51,665
It's just that, like,

38660
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:52,699
you haven't done the experiment

38670
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:53,133
for yourself

38680
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:54,000
and you're not trusting

38690
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,602
that it's done in the right way.

38700
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:57,904
And so I was hoping at least that

38710
01:47:57,904 --> 01:47:58,271
the more

38720
01:47:58,271 --> 01:47:59,039
we can help people

38730
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:02,042
communicate and understand each other

38740
01:48:02,042 --> 01:48:04,578
and have high fidelity accounting system

38750
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:08,381
so we can be accountable,

38760
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:10,150
the more we can solve problems together

38770
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:10,750
and like things

38780
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,184
that wasn't

38790
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:13,353
being rewarded in academia itself,

38800
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:17,757
we, we needed to go outside and position

38810
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:19,926
between academia

38820
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:23,129
and industry and society.

38830
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,298
So that's how we decided to form,

38840
01:48:25,298 --> 01:48:26,233
to post.

38850
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:28,301
That.

38860
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:28,835
That notion

38870
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:31,004
of accountable communication

38880
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:33,240
is really powerful

38890
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,041
because we see cases

38900
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:36,142
where communications

38910
01:48:36,142 --> 01:48:36,810
are accounted

38920
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,211
for, metadata,

38930
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:40,313
logging and peer review

38940
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:42,782
and where are we accountable socially?

38950
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:43,250
Where is it

38960
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,418
a digital accountability

38970
01:48:45,418 --> 01:48:48,188
and the accounting schemes are askew

38980
01:48:48,555 --> 01:48:51,091
and so people are looking at their shred

38990
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:52,592
of the spreadsheet

39000
01:48:52,592 --> 01:48:55,929
and uncertain on how those numbers

39010
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:56,696
were derived,

39020
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:57,864
whether It's the whole picture.

39030
01:48:57,864 --> 01:48:59,232
Or do you have all the sheets

39040
01:48:59,232 --> 01:49:00,700
in that file, like

39050
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,102
with a partial picture?

39060
01:49:02,102 --> 01:49:04,404
And yet the space of

39070
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:06,673
communication strategies just like that

39080
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:09,809
thousand part transistor board was vast.

39090
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:10,143
Well,

39100
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:11,912
there's more than a thousand people.

39110
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:14,347
And so the space of communication

39120
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:18,552
simply edges, let alone quality and tone

39130
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:22,422
and content is so vast that again, it

39140
01:49:22,422 --> 01:49:25,659
emphasizes the need for a vocabulary

39150
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:26,726
and a grammar

39160
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:26,927
and a

39170
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:28,528
syntax of composable,

39180
01:49:28,528 --> 01:49:30,564
dynamic organizational structures.

39190
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:34,301
So we can even begin to be working

39200
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:35,669
not just in this one

39210
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:36,469
very local

39220
01:49:36,469 --> 01:49:39,606
potentially reason in organizational

39230
01:49:39,706 --> 01:49:40,240
space.

39240
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:42,676
Yeah, I totally agree.

39250
01:49:42,676 --> 01:49:44,511
I mean, in computers, in the Internet,

39260
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:47,180
we have very composable things

39270
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:49,115
that you can really make math out of

39280
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:51,017
and at every scale in some sense

39290
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:51,384
there is like

39300
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:52,953
the same sort of thing happening.

39310
01:49:52,953 --> 01:49:54,621
And this allows computer scientists

39320
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:57,257
to talk to each other and guy working.

39330
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:58,258
So we're working on

39340
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,492
like internet protocols

39350
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:01,361
and some transistors.

39360
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:02,295
On some level

39370
01:50:02,295 --> 01:50:03,630
they can kind of talk,

39380
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:06,099
but like an urban planning person

39390
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:09,603
and a, you know, a biologist, geneticist

39400
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,538
and a mathematician and like,

39410
01:50:11,538 --> 01:50:13,006
I don't know, whatever.

39420
01:50:13,006 --> 01:50:15,408
It's like these people across society,

39430
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:16,776
they have their like talking

39440
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:18,378
and wingding said each other

39450
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:19,679
like they're just like,

39460
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:20,614
you know,

39470
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:23,116
mailbox, envelope, ampersand

39480
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:24,250
and like they don't understand

39490
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,185
what each other is talking about.

39500
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:26,653
And that we're never going to

39510
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:29,422
if we can't cohere.

39520
01:50:29,422 --> 01:50:30,090
Like there's

39530
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,057
this all these little languages

39540
01:50:31,057 --> 01:50:32,659
that are not coherent together.

39550
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:34,327
And in category theory,

39560
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:35,729
there's tons of languages,

39570
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:36,796
a language of topology,

39580
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:37,964
there's a language of algebra,

39590
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:40,000
the language of logic and logic.

39600
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,266
You know,

39610
01:50:40,266 --> 01:50:41,901
there's number theory,

39620
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:43,503
there's tons and tons of languages

39630
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:46,339
and each one needs to be an isolated

39640
01:50:46,506 --> 01:50:47,941
like needs to have its own space

39650
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:50,043
so it can develop notation for itself,

39660
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:52,412
so it can develop techniques for itself

39670
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:53,580
and not have to ask

39680
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,382
anybody else's permission and.

39690
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:56,583
What category theory?

39700
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:57,017
And same

39710
01:50:57,017 --> 01:50:58,985
with like urban planning and genetics

39720
01:50:58,985 --> 01:50:59,653
like they don't.

39730
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:00,420
And the geneticist

39740
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:01,454
doesn't want to say like,

39750
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:02,088
oh, sorry,

39760
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:02,989
I used

39770
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,891
the word, you know, structure

39780
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:05,492
and I know

39790
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:06,626
already using the word structure.

39800
01:51:06,626 --> 01:51:07,627
So we'll call it something else

39810
01:51:07,627 --> 01:51:08,395
like they don't want to like

39820
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:09,696
have to do that.

39830
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:11,264
And yet in category theory,

39840
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:12,666
what it allows you to do

39850
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,968
in math is take topology

39860
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:16,469
and make an analogy

39870
01:51:16,469 --> 01:51:18,872
with number theory or with algebra

39880
01:51:19,139 --> 01:51:20,740
and actually send information

39890
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,776
that can lands intact

39900
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:24,377
because the function tells you

39910
01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:25,945
what you're expecting to keep

39920
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:26,713
and what you're expected

39930
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:28,982
to lose across this connection

39940
01:51:28,982 --> 01:51:30,350
and anything you expect

39950
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,651
and keep, it keeps.

39960
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:33,453
And so what we're hoping for

39970
01:51:33,453 --> 01:51:35,121
is that by creating

39980
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:36,389
like finding

39990
01:51:36,389 --> 01:51:38,158
languages that that you can use

40000
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:39,693
across lots of disciplines,

40010
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,628
from epidemiology to

40020
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:42,729
chemistry or whatever,

40030
01:51:43,763 --> 01:51:44,130
we can

40040
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,432
create single like

40050
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:46,733
languages and then connect them

40060
01:51:46,733 --> 01:51:48,201
to other languages,

40070
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,770
database languages and physics languages

40080
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:51,905
and stuff like that,

40090
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:54,274
and allow them to each evolve

40100
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:57,844
and create their own independent

40110
01:51:57,844 --> 01:51:59,312
notation and techniques

40120
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:01,581
and yet be able to have that interface,

40130
01:52:01,581 --> 01:52:02,615
that compress thing

40140
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:04,050
sends something across the boundary

40150
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:04,818
to somebody else

40160
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:06,586
and have it arrive intact

40170
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:11,458
in a trustworthy and accountable way.

40180
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:12,358
Awesome.

40190
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:12,992
Well, David,

40200
01:52:12,992 --> 01:52:14,961
thanks for hanging out with us

40210
01:52:14,961 --> 01:52:17,564
and talking to us about Category three

40220
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:19,399
and maybe come back and talk to us

40230
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:19,999
some more about it

40240
01:52:19,999 --> 01:52:22,001
and maybe we can align deeper on

40250
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:23,203
on the relationship

40260
01:52:23,203 --> 01:52:24,738
between the type of things

40270
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:25,438
that you're discussing

40280
01:52:25,438 --> 01:52:27,240
and to activate it. That's great.

40290
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:27,707
That's great.

40300
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:27,907
Yeah.

40310
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,409
Thanks a lot for the invitation

40320
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,244
to to be with you guys today.

40330
01:52:31,244 --> 01:52:32,378
Okay, thanks.

40340
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:32,946
Thank you, David.

40350
01:52:32,946 --> 01:52:36,149
Good bye. Bye.
