4770	401060	00:04	Sean Tull will present a formal approach to how you can describe active inference in terms of an entirely graphical language called the language of string diagrams. If you're watching Live, please feel free to write your questions in the Live chat.	Sean Tull will present active inference in string diagrams on September 1	Active Inference in String Di diagrams
402710	564950	06:42	A category amounts to a collection of objects, or sometimes called systems, and what are called morphisms. What you can do with these processes is compose them. From these you can build much more elaborate string diagrams in your category.	Minoidal categories and string diagrams are examples of symmetric minoidal categories	Minoidal Category and String Diagrams
565450	850930	09:25	The point of category three is extremely general. This could be talking about computational processes or physical processes or quantum processes. To do that, you use extra structure that this category has. It forms what's called a copy discard category. These let us turn some things that you normally have to do with equations into simpler pictures.	Amorphism is a morphism with no input or an output	Applied category theory, the state-level morphisms
852150	1212360	14:12	So I want to talk about generative models and how you view these in the diagrams. The way that these visual networks are drawn in active inference text is converging on something a bit closer to string diagrams. You really do label everything, not just the variables.	So I want to talk about generative models and how you view these in diagrams	Bayesian Networks and generative models
1212730	1497460	20:12	A simple generative model of that form would just look like this network diagram. More elaborate example of generative models are discrete time models. Often you will see models being plugged together to form these hierarchical models. In particular, we'll talk about how you update a model or update the beliefs within a model.	Generative models describe how to update beliefs within a model	In the world of generative models
1498230	1807240	24:58	When your observations are sharp, you can do Bayesian updating. There's at least two ways to generalize sort of the picture from the last slide to give a notion of updating. Instead of approximate things using free energy, I'll talk about free energy next.	So we want to talk about how you can do Bayesian updating in string diagrams	Bayesian updating and Bayesian conditional channel
1809770	1859480	30:09	If you have two distributions, sigma and Omega, the surprise of one distribution relative to the other is defined by this expectation value. Important special cases where this come up are when you're calculating entropy, which is the self surprise. And the KL divergence can be calculated from the surprise and the entropy.	The surprise of one distribution relative to the other is defined by expectation value	Exploring surprise of distributions
1861370	2068120	31:01	The paper helps clarify the different notions of free energy that we found in active instruments. In particular the variational and the expected free energy energy. It all comes down basically to having a definition of surprise. This is a third notion of updating for soft observations, which is an interesting way to think about what VFE minimization is doing.	We define variational and expected free energy energy in this paper	Free Energy and the VFE update
2068970	2628794	34:28	In active inference, what we're doing is we're receiving two things. We're receiving an observation in the current time and we have some preferences about what we'd like to see in the future. To show what active inference itself will kind of look like in terms of string diagrams.	In active inference, what we're doing is we're receiving two things	Inactive Inference: The expected free energy
2628912	2887680	43:48	The way in which free energy itself is compositional. The idea is that we want to think of this one free energy principle applying at all levels of a system. More interestingly, there's the second way inwhich it's compositional, which is the sequential mode of plugging models together.	The way in which free energy itself is compositional is discussed here	Open VFE and the compositional framework
2889570	2994480	48:09	String diagrams provide some natural language for talking about active inference. They give you a nice representational language for just drawing pictures of your generative models. Also let you do the reasoning because you can do probability theory with them.	String diagrams provide a natural language for talking about active inference	Active Inference with String Di diagrams
2995730	3071180	49:55	There's lots of other questions around. It would be nice to connect this now to topics in AI and so on. Think about how it relates to other, basically applications of category theory in AI. Could try and connect this up to lots of further topics.	I talked about two notions of updating with respect to soft observations	Jeffrey-style and Pearl-style updating in AI
3071630	3131094	51:11	And something else we were also interested in that I mentioned is that we got into the topic by thinking about consciousness. There's been just loads of proposals for how active inference is related to consciousness. So that's something we'd love to do in future. But for now, I'd like to say thanks again to all of you for listening.	Daniel: Thanks so much, Sean, for your really fascinating presentation	The String Diagrammatic Approach to Consciousness
3131292	3494874	52:11	String diagram formulation of active inference kind of takes a similar approach to somehow providing more than just handy tool for representing active inference modeling. It opens up new possibilities for further developments in active inference theory. If you never used this kind of compositional view, there is stuff you would miss.	String diagram formulation of quantum mechanics unveils properties difficult to see with Hamiltonian	String diagrams and active Inference
3494912	3910820	58:14	The project is part of a larger project for developing collective intelligence. Can you compare this kind of formulation to this recent formulation of constructor theory in terms of string diagrams or categorical formulation. Would love to see various aspects of cognitive science understood categorically.	This project is part of a larger project for developing collective intelligence	Categorical formulation of Consciousness
3912790	4144140	1:05:12	How is time treated in category theory? Or how does active inference treat time today? We talk about discrete time and continuous time generative models. How does that give us a different grasp on dynamical modeling?	How is time treated in category theory or active inference	How is time treated in category theory and active Inference?
4145310	4434370	1:09:05	The best way to learn string diagrams, I think, if I'm going to talk about it like this. There will be various nice introductions out there to using them. I would recommend finding a nice introductory paper in whatever field you're most used to.	How do we go about learning to draw string diagrams	How to learn String Diagrams
4434460	4766260	1:13:54	In quantum formulation of active inference or quantum active inference, there's this attempt to also develop the retradiction aspect of inference as well. Can this formulation be reconciled with quantum Bayesianism as well?	Can this formulation be reconciled with quantum Bayesianism as well	Non-Classical Bayesian Inference
4770070	5016786	1:19:30	Ollie: I'm really excited to see this line of development in active inference theory. My hope is that ultimately these different strands can be unified into coherent and overarching framework. I'd love to apply for those topics.	Ollie: I'm excited to see development in active inference theory	Active Inference and Categorization
5016888	5227840	1:23:36	The physical and the cognitive science come together. What language could express such work? Right now we're speaking in English with the active inference ontology dialect. I would love to see string diagrams and other approaches.	Sean: I would love to see string diagrams and other approaches	Intelligence and the Bayesian Model
