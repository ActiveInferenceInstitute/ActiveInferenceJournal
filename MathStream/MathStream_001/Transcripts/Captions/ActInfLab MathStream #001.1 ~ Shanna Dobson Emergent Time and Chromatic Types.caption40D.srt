00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:06,873
Hello.

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,175
Welcome to the Active Inference Lab.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,747
This is Math Stream, 1.1,
our first math stream.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,319
And we're really lucky today to be able
to have some time with Shannon Dobson.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,155
And we're going to be talking about
emergent time and chromatic types

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:26,426
and hear a lot more on this topic
and also check in with everyone's

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,862
questions that are in the live chat
or in the comments later.

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,698
But first of all,
just quickly introduce yourself

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,900
and then hear a presentation
and then have a discussion.

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,704
So again, I'm Daniel
and I'm here with my co organizer, Sarah.

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,108
So maybe Sarah, say hi
and then pass it off Hey.

12
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,346
Sarah calling in from Lockdown Forever
Berlin, Germany, and

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,283
I'm looking forward to talking to

14
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,520
Sheena Dobson

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,888
and who we are.

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,922
Thank you.

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,390
Thank you for a nice intro.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,891
Hello, everyone.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,761
My name is Shana, and I am
I'll be a graduate student in the fall,

20
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,396
but I've started a whole bunch of stuff

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,067
in the middle,
and I'm kind of a, I guess, a polymath

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,237
that got a bunch of degrees at once
and did a master's.

23
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,674
And I'm a I was hired right away as
a full time lecturer, kind of everywhere.

24
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,211
And then a couple topics
and I'm pretty interested in.

25
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:23,817
So let's see if if this can be exciting
for someone like Shayna.

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,885
I'm sure your attention

27
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,959
OK. Daniel, can you see this?

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,260
OK? Yep.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,062
All right.

30
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,497
Am I ready to go?

31
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,265
OK, good.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,800
All right.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,101
All right.

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:46,506
So I want to talk about emergent time
and chromatic types and maybe

35
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,376
I mean, it's up to you all
if you want to ask me questions as I go

36
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,012
or maybe hold them
because I'm trying to concentrate.

37
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,514
What's going on here?

38
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,051
You're going to see there's some heavy
topics involved, but I tried to make them

39
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,790
as beautiful and palatable as I can,
so let's just get right to it.

40
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,792
What are these
and what am I talking about?

41
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,294
So I have a few questions

42
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,530
kind of driving this independent
of the mathematics.

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,133
I'm trying to make this
not super math focused.

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,569
I was trying to make those kind
of more applicable to everyone

45
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,872
because the math that I do is super
niche,

46
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,375
and I was trying to not do that
and be like non-inclusive.

47
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,944
So the big questions are philosophy.

48
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,413
Questions
that are driving me is What is time?

49
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,083
Is there anything that isn't time?

50
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,087
Time is always modeled as either
just like a Geiger counter

51
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,790
or it's this sort of accepted
background phenomena.

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,092
And I don't really agree with that.

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,361
I feel like
we haven't focused too much on it.

54
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,563
People think like, where is it?

55
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,432
You know,
I ask like sometimes I give talks and my,

56
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,202
my first question is like,
where is yesterday?

57
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,970
And of course, people like what?

58
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,206
You know, you could zoom out
and look at like the light,

59
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,375
you know, the light cone data
and things like that.

60
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,677
But it's like phenomenological,
really interesting.

61
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,347
Where is it and will it always be here?

62
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,349
And I remember
I was talking to Rafael before, so

63
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,419
and he's got this great paper about like,
you know, I mean, is it

64
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,088
we would always be here
and maybe it's not.

65
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:14,227
Maybe it's sort of
just maybe it came at some point as well.

66
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,563
And so I think it's sort of emergent.

67
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,398
So not like wasn't always here.

68
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,167
And here is probably not the appropriate
word. You're going to see that.

69
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,035
I love language.

70
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,436
So again, I'm super polymath

71
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,639
and a lot of my math
papers are super math philosophy.

72
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,476
And so I think there's
a lot of problematic

73
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,646
terms that we need to actually go into.

74
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,416
And so I actually said,
where's not our comedian time?

75
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,919
You know, so none our comedian the
you know, the

76
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,289
to be our comedian
is to believe in Infinitesimals

77
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,391
that you can always have a number bigger
or lower

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,828
and quantum mechanics,
you really have a cutoff, right?

79
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,733
So if quantum mechanics does modeling,
you know, cutoffs as you know,

80
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,037
spatial cut outs is not our comedian,
why is time not also not our comedian?

81
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,672
So I'm very interested in that.

82
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,807
What would that actually look like?

83
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,812
And we go heavy into that so, you know,
Sarah, I have the air that's theory

84
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,182
DA in the French continental philosophy
saying that there's always a

85
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,117
there is an A mathematics.

86
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,854
We always go there exists, you know,
there exists an X such that whatever.

87
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,756
And so that's very powerful.

88
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,157
The existential quantifier.

89
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,759
Right. But and qualifier.

90
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,528
But I'm you know,
what are the conditions for existence?

91
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,731
This is something
Chris Fields and I are working on.

92
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,201
Like what are those
not just like metabolic conditions,

93
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,472
I mean, all of this, you know, so
I think the big bang is a real problem.

94
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,876
And like going into that, of course,
you have all these wild theories about,

95
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,446
well, you know, it's like a white
you know, like a white hole

96
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,782
that pass through something else
and all this kind of stuff.

97
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,384
But I'm really interested in like

98
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,120
what are the conditions
to even have existence, right?

99
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,090
So what what would the conditions
be to have a discretization of time

100
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,892
what does that even mean?

101
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,728
So what is entropy
and a temporal discretization?

102
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,564
So we have this very vague
notion of entropy.

103
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,869
And I agree with Max Tegmark that
there is no objective notion of entropy.

104
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,272
You're like, oh, well,
there's a local influx of energy here,

105
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,409
but you know, the environment
surrounding it, loss energy.

106
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,644
So there seems to be a calibration
there, you know.

107
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:16,482
So my whole point is to category
the stop mechanism, just like

108
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,486
Chris talked about in his last talk,
you know, biologically speaking,

109
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,223
like when to stop, like,
you know, cellular dividing.

110
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:29,262
The stop mechanism on the bio level is
very, very, very intricate in my opinion.

111
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,097
And so I'm wondering like,

112
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,500
how would you categorize by that,
I mean like using category theory?

113
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,704
So my whole vibe here
is to try to actually

114
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,541
upgrade the mathematics that's used
in modeling some of these things.

115
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,511
Again, my head is pretty abstract,
so I see things abstractly,

116
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,412
but I think it's a gift

117
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,283
because it's allowing me
to see connections in a nonlinear way.

118
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,787
So my brain is definitely nonlinear and
I try to use that in linear phenomena.

119
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,458
So I say, you know, how can we say,
you know, there exists a time asymmetry?

120
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,260
But he uses this like phrase, well,
when there is no objective

121
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,796
notion of entropy,
I think it's really, really tricky.

122
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,632
There's also no proven
structural causality.

123
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:06,933
All right.

124
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,770
And so you had this, you know, the light
cone, it's a little vague right?

125
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,805
There's some problems with g r there,

126
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,808
some problems with the formulation
of light cone and things like that.

127
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,878
Light cones wouldn't withstand
quantum mechanics and stuff like that.

128
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,414
So I firmly believe, you know,

129
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,250
just like Bertrand Russell,
that there is no structural causality

130
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,487
and it leads you into these great things
like last Thursday ism.

131
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,087
And, you know,

132
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,756
the world was made 5 minutes ago

133
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,525
and there's really no logical
impossibility in saying that.

134
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,062
So I have not seen
a structural causality.

135
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,363
And so again, Chris Fields

136
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,699
and I agree with this,
and that's why we're writing this stuff

137
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,302
number eight,
why are we actually experience memories?

138
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,104
This is actually

139
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,443
like why a lot of this is very again,
taken for granted.

140
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,247
And so I'm really interested in
like why that is cause people

141
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,517
say you have memories to prevent you
from falling off a cliff again,

142
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:03,189
like association and base Pavlovian,
you know, survival.

143
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,525
And that's not what I'm talking about.
Right.

144
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,796
I'm actually talking about like how
why do you experience them?

145
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,533
Somebody like me, like a total precog,
like I remember everything.

146
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,036
And sometimes I can get haunted
by thoughts like memories

147
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,474
that just come, come in and I know
there's a lot of people like that.

148
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,675
Maybe you're just taking a test

149
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,877
and these horrible memories
just fly in your head.

150
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,813
Or maybe they're really good memories,

151
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,882
but the experience of
that is very strange.

152
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,552
Nobody knows what a thought is. Right.
And I was there.

153
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,687
I think you asked and Sarah and Chris,
it's talk.

154
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,155
You know what?

155
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,557
What is a thought?

156
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,893
And I've I haven't heard anything
about what those are people.

157
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,962
Oh, quantum fluctuations
and things like this.

158
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,265
Yeah, but there's something else going on
because,

159
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,102
you know, for instance,
like the speech that I just said,

160
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:55,274
I read number eight 2 minutes ago
and so the speech is gone, right?

161
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,477
It dies, but something remains.

162
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,912
And so what is that?

163
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,214
It seems like there's a hologram,

164
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,550
a copy of everything that you say
that's actually stored in the brain.

165
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
And you're doing
some kind of recall with that.

166
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,956
But I don't understand
storage of everything is discrete.

167
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,692
And so that's why this is very complex
and very beautiful.

168
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,794
So I say, what are they like?

169
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,562
What is the fundamental unit of thought?

170
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,930
You know, Alan Watts is going to say so.

171
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,931
Oh, it's like existence

172
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,067
and I'm not really sure
what the bio people are going to say.

173
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,201
What is it?

174
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,770
You know,
what is not a thought, you know?

175
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,907
So for me, you're going to see that I'm
going to invoke this finite condition,

176
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,246
a finite set is a compact,
totally disconnected space.

177
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,615
It's, it's it's like a cantor set.

178
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,784
So I think that what's happening
is time is like a cantor set.

179
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,288
And somehow
you are recalling over a Cantor set.

180
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,391
What is a thought that no idea, right?

181
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,628
No idea
how we're even speaking to each other.

182
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,196
So I think we actually need to go over
what that is.

183
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,331
These are just the questions
having begun the talk, right?

184
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,400
So questions, too, right?

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,068
What is causality like?

186
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,672
What is it again, if I don't believe in
structure you know, oh, A came before B,

187
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,776
that's very reference frame dependent
and reference frames are flimsy.

188
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,677
Right.

189
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,680
And so I say, well, causality per him
and then I say, well,

190
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,149
what is a measurement
that's very tricky, right?

191
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,419
Of course, the quantum problem
and just measurement in general.

192
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,153
Yeah.

193
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,622
And I say, well, what is a reference
frame that's even worse.

194
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,562
You know, according to me, my world,
according to me and my who is me?

195
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,397
And so that's going to be tricky.

196
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,702
So Chris and I both agree, like
what is this personal identity over time?

197
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,872
And you've got big branches of philosophy
like paternalism and endurance,

198
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,608
as I'm trying to do,
trying to figure out what that is right.

199
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,478
Who is this right?

200
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,315
Is is me today the same as me yesterday?

201
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,885
Well, clearly not, because the cells
are doing a whole bunch of things right.

202
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,154
We don't have any of the same cells
that we used to have.

203
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,358
I mean, maybe it's the neuronal things,
but, you know, you have a boundary.

204
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,426
And so what's happened?

205
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,828
So, you know,
I don't understand what over time means.

206
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,030
I don't know how anyone can be over
anything.

207
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,266
So then, you know, Sarah,
it wasn't you know,

208
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,468
shouldn't you talk about space time?

209
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,903
And I'm like, that's just a manifold.

210
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,505
It's like one of the most basic
structures in mathematics.

211
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,774
And we have more sophisticated
mathematics.

212
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,410
So I don't really vibe
with the manifold thought.

213
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,245
I think you can really,

214
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,749
really sparkle and dazzle
that up to see what's actually happening.

215
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,151
I don't know if you actually have
to unify them like that.

216
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,322
You could just be specializing time
instead of leaving time as it is.

217
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,192
So then I'm like, OK,
if you want to just use like

218
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,528
manifold and differential geometry,
you could also go number theory.

219
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,262
And so like

220
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,998
what would a number
theoretic time look like

221
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,100
and what would a number
theoretic space look like?

222
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,037
So you don't have to
just like my whole point is that physics,

223
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:42,675
like the framing of physics, is based
on the mathematics at the current time.

224
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,112
So a lot of quantum mechanics is like
linear algebra and operator theory,

225
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,382
but you could also up that
and make it like algebraic number theory

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,750
and then you'd get new physics.

227
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,819
So with me,
if you give new math, you get new physics

228
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,189
so upgrade the math, you know, so
what is the number theoretic black hole?

229
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:02,461
That sounds a lot cooler to me than the,
you know, the framing of the black hole.

230
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,664
The old model has a lot of problems.

231
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,233
Can you also, like, see me? OK, yep.

232
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,067
OK, cool.

233
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:08,300
All right.

234
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,237
So let's go through this outline
and again, I'll just keep the talk

235
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,805
at like an hour and then

236
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:14,974
all right.

237
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:15,608
So here we go.

238
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,544
So those are my like big questions,
kind of funneling everything.

239
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,247
So I'll talk about discrete time.

240
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,083
I'm going to really firmly say
that there is no synchronous

241
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,652
reference, that everything
that's happening now already happened.

242
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:31,457
You do have like a lot of time
in the brain to process.

243
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,861
So there is nobody is experiencing
anything as it is and things like that.

244
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,463
Also going to say that there really is

245
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,833
no self reflexivity because I don't know
if that there's a self

246
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,571
and so Chris and I are trying to actually
formulate all this together, right?

247
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,541
So I really don't think there is
a production designer and Darren doesn't

248
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,078
with those two philosophies
that are trying to say that you exist

249
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,015
as a four dimensional being
and you kind of exist through time.

250
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,250
And I think there's some problems
with that.

251
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,419
So problems with current
ism are enduring.

252
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,489
Schism is like, Oh, I got cut
and I have a reaction later.

253
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,726
You know, those pieces of you
were supposed to be independent,

254
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,861
but they're not.
We're in touch with our pain.

255
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,264
But they would say that it's like
not so it's, it's a little tricky.

256
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,000
I think there is no personal identity
over time.

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,435
I have no idea how this is happening.

258
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,271
There's like a
reset happening every, every,

259
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:20,806
every

260
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,409
whatever
you may not want to say Planck time,

261
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,579
but if there's not personal identity
over time, there's definitely, you know,

262
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,182
so I think the memory, whatever
it is, has a singular support.

263
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,185
The support is the, the,

264
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,823
the the places
where function is not zero.

265
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,026
So if you only have singular support,
then that means you're not zero

266
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,528
on a singular set.

267
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,098
So it's actually again,
I'm trying to upgrade the mathematics

268
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,802
used in all of this to fractals
and Cantor sets things like that.

269
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,904
I'll introduce chromatic types

270
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,040
and chromatic types is going to be
this new spin that I'm working on

271
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,277
that's sort of paralleling
what's called a helmet Toby type

272
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,113
a new holographic principle
based on these diamonds

273
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,415
that I really like and emergent time.

274
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,819
OK, so for the why, how and to

275
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,988
what extent that I was asked
to kind of fill out and said why?

276
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,890
Because this day there does not exist
a coherent

277
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,592
formalism of emergent time
nor discretization of time.

278
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,394
Imagine there is no continuum, right?

279
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,429
That's a huge, huge segment.

280
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,066
What exists actually between
the discretization what is emergence?

281
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,402
How can we again are complexity

282
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,172
of class, complexity
class in the sense of Turing degrees.

283
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,173
That's what I'm referring to.

284
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,543
So not equivalence classes, Sarah,
but like the Turing degree equivalent

285
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,147
that you still have this like there is,
and that's the physics of time

286
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,716
equivalent of a meaningful president,
but it's absent of all

287
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,152
because it was string
because industry is like sophistry.

288
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,623
We have a we have lots of physics
sophistry and mathematical sophistry.

289
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,760
And I'm like,
can we actually try to figure out how

290
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,598
we can actually have existence
with this discretization of time

291
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,702
independent of any kind of conniving,
you know, so how well we're going to,

292
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,470
you know,
hopefully have a wonderful introduction

293
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,440
discretization mathematically
all of it is commensurate with it.

294
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,010
OK, so I'm into a lot of.

295
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,580
Metrics.

296
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,651
Where you can construct spaces
based on algebraic spaces.

297
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,953
So I'm going to

298
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,722
try to go really lightly through this
because this is pretty heavy,

299
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,527
but so you can quotient out a scheme
which is like a higher dimensional notion

300
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:26,465
of an algebraic variety by a Patel
equivalence relation pro it tells us

301
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,835
a certain topology, an equivalence
relation is going to be a gluing.

302
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,303
So you get this diamond,

303
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,808
which is a shiv on a category
and a category called Perfecto IT spaces.

304
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,978
So this diamond
has these quote impurities

305
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,080
which are these geometric points
I refer to.

306
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:46,685
So this is a notion from Peter Schlosser
and I really like the diamond idea.

307
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,688
And so what happens
is that you have this,

308
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,993
this geometric point, which is a more
ism of schemes and it's almost like

309
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,598
so it's sort of like this that there are
mathematical impurities in this object.

310
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:04,403
And so when you have a normal diamond
and you have different colors on it

311
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,007
that are reflections of the impurities,
but you don't ever actually see

312
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,510
the impurity itself, you just see
the reflections of the impurities.

313
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,781
And so you're never actually getting
the thing, you're actually only getting

314
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:20,286
shifted versions of a reflection that's
what I think is going on here, right?

315
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,156
So you have your,
you know, your interface and no one's

316
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,526
ever actually experiencing the thing,
just a pro finally many copies.

317
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,560
So you can,

318
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,464
you can pull this Marxism of scheme back,
which is a technological move.

319
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,333
Then you get this what's called a pro.

320
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,001
Finally, many copies of spots.

321
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:40,039
See, this is the attic spectrum
of an algebraically closed curve.

322
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,910
So you can make these products for C
cross s underline for s underline being a

323
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,048
pro finite set, which I described earlier
so you can get these awesome products.

324
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:54,887
And this is
this is the new model that I use to write

325
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,389
this cool paper with

326
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,592
my awesome colleague
Robert Kuttner about a new model

327
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,129
of consciousness where it's like,
OK, this is what's going on.

328
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,300
You know, you have pro finally
many copies of this of of perception.

329
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,304
It's you're not really perceiving so
but that's pretty deep.

330
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,273
That's the hardest
some of the hardest math on the planet.

331
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:19,945
It's like looking at sheaves
on a category so democratized time.

332
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:20,179
Right?

333
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,181
So something I came up with just a bit
ago is like,

334
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,150
you know, there really is
no you can't really say A equals B,

335
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,354
whatever you want to say that really
what you're saying is a equals

336
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,891
B up to some condition X where X is
what is called a homer tobi type.

337
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,995
So type theory is like pretty rampant

338
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,365
in the end, like lots of awesome models.

339
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,535
And so a homophobic type
is going to be like a it's an equivalent,

340
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,140
it's an equivalence based on homo topaz,
which are deformations

341
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,174
between two spaces.

342
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,544
So you can say a is equivalent to be
a criterion X is considered

343
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,447
Z to be really careful
with the statement equals.

344
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,351
Yeah, and so really we really only have
Intersubjective agreement

345
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,486
on certain metrics.

346
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,088
So I really think there is no equality
for anything.

347
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,358
You just have a bunch of agents
agreeing on these metrics, right?

348
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,461
The brilliant Don
Hoffmann has a bunch of work on that too.

349
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,331
And I was working in his research group
for a bit.

350
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,235
So, you know, I think that mentation
these biological processes is I

351
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:16,902
just give him

352
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,538
a talk on like

353
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,274
Mentation and a certain hematology type

354
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,411
that it actually works in discrete time.

355
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,446
So how are you actually going to do that?

356
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,949
How can you actually model memory
and biological functions

357
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,619
over a disparate times time
that looks like a bunch of dots.

358
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,555
So that looks like memory
of a singular support.

359
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,956
And you're going to have to

360
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,126
really figure out how you could get words
and things like that.

361
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,862
So what I'm going to do is like introduce
this paramedic types.

362
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,098
So again,
there's no personal identity over time.

363
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,867
I think you only have chromatic 2 hours
of localization.

364
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,002
I'll go over that.

365
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,739
But in your singular support, you're
doing what's called a localization.

366
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,175
Localization is a way of adding inverses.

367
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,911
And, you know,
for instance, the integers, right?

368
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,045
If you want to add

369
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,315
inverses to the integers, you need to get
something like the rational numbers.

370
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,821
So to add inverses as a way of making
a space more full, I'll say.

371
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,056
And then also you can take categories

372
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,560
which are morph isms
and you can make them morph isms.

373
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,662
Isomorphic
which means they're invertible.

374
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,764
So localization is very powerful.

375
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,033
So again,
there really is no personal identity.

376
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,535
There's only personal identity
up to time.

377
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,538
I also think, I don't know, time
may be just the up too condition

378
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,739
for you to exist.

379
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,243
You are in essence localizing
at each point of the singular supports,

380
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,911
and I think I wrote it.

381
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,313
Yeah, wrote a little paper about this

382
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,915
that should be out
in the Journal of Cognitive Science.

383
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,017
So hopefully it's there.

384
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,152
So it is this.

385
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,122
So how much tummy time does the top
a logical space regarded up to a week?

386
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,490
How much will be equivalence

387
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,359
OK, so it's

388
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,429
a top a logical space regarded up to

389
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,065
how you know, how you can actually

390
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,734
equate various objects in the space

391
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,470
and what's called an infinity group void.

392
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,407
You know, you can get an infinity group
where all the Morph isms

393
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,010
are actually
so all the maps are actually invertible.

394
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:09,047
So we call we cometary equivalence
and map between typological spaces

395
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,384
which induces isomorphism
on all the topic groups.

396
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,420
How much of your groups are encoding

397
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,089
the homophobe behavior?

398
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,927
And so, so that's in that book
that I recommended to you so groups.

399
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,297
So we're familiar with groups,
you know that you know where symmetries

400
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,101
relate an object to itself,
but a group void, you have symmetries

401
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,437
acting between more than one object
as you can see in this like this visual.

402
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,772
So I've got a,

403
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,042
B, C, D, these are multiple objects
and you have maps going everywhere.

404
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:42,447
So a group void is a category
where all the morph isms are isomorphism.

405
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,186
So if I have an Infinity group, it means
I have an infinite, infinite morph isms.

406
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,254
So infinite Isomorphism.

407
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,990
So the big idea for the chromatic type
is to actually

408
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,093
put a chromatic tower
over a temporal logic.

409
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,695
We're all familiar with temporal logic

410
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,531
and you're
going to see what I mean by this tower.

411
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:04,336
So I think you can actually create
chromatic types instead of a hematocrit

412
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,037
type.

413
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,906
So we're going to be interested
in creating these chromatic spaces

414
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,376
that have their own notion
of localization.

415
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,546
And then you can get a new idea of time.

416
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,349
So localizing a geometric comatose.

417
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,317
So again, I told you,

418
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,487
localization is a way of adding
inverses in category theory.

419
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,890
That means you want to make your maps
isomorphism.

420
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,327
So we say given a category C
and a Class W more prisms,

421
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,963
we see the localization CW inverse.

422
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,032
You can get a reflective localization.

423
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,903
What you do is you localize, which means
add inverses, you complete the space.

424
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,740
If that's the Koshy space,
if you want to get sequences to converge,

425
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,577
and then you take the inverse limit
which is gluing, you're going to see.

426
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,979
I do a lot of gluing.

427
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,015
So for a category categories,
collection of objects and more prisms

428
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,018
and you have an associativity condition
and an identity arrow.

429
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,221
So how much of this again are maps ways

430
00:20:56,221 --> 00:21:00,192
to get ways to get objects
to be equivalents?

431
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,694
And there's all kinds of ways
that you can do that.

432
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,031
So I'm interested in something
on top of logical localization.

433
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,001
So this is another type
of chocolate localization.

434
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,337
So we see a type electrical localization
as a left exact localization.

435
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,873
And again, I'm going to go very gentle
with some of these definitions,

436
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,477
left exact localization of an affinity
one category.

437
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,013
So that's a category
with infinitely more presence

438
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,549
in the sense of passing
to what's called a reflective seven

439
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,919
for any one category ET a collection
morph isms that are mono morph isms.

440
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:33,258
So with the details are
of course they're important, but for

441
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,396
the full point is
that you have a reflective subcategory.

442
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,631
What's that reflective subcategory?

443
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,634
It's a full subcategory
such that the objects

444
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,438
in the more bosoms
have reflections in the category.

445
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,073
So that's very cool.

446
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,343
So the objects
and the more prisms have reflections.

447
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,778
Every object and D

448
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,915
looks at its own reflection
by a certain amorphous empty data TD

449
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,383
and the reflection of an object

450
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,852
see and see is actually equipped
with an isomorphism.

451
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,220
So that's great.

452
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,824
The inclusion creates all limits and
it has all cool limits which do admit.

453
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,661
So the to say that you have limits
and code limits means

454
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,398
that your categories sort of a very,
very nicely well behaved.

455
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,536
So this is very neat
that in the reflective subcategory

456
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,539
it seems very apropos to pair
that with the diamond work that

457
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm trying to do because

458
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,376
the diamond is dealing with

459
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,947
finite limit copies of these reflections
and the reflective sub category

460
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:34,052
contains
reflections of the actual objects.

461
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,356
It's a very, very special

462
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,558
subcategory.

463
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,329
So again, the whole idea is to get OK,
so maybe at every moment

464
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,666
you are actually top
a logically localizing

465
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,867
and so that actually means
you're actually

466
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,937
just looking at your own reflections
all the time, which you are, right?

467
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,240
There's a lot of maxim
that say, you know, you see what you are.

468
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,375
Absolutely.

469
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,512
So I still, you know, so I'm using
all of that beautiful mathematics

470
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:05,817
to actually justify a statement
that would only be like

471
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,421
without the mathematics, the statement
would just be like a sentence.

472
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,823
And I can actually try to justify it
structurally.

473
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,627
So think you're actually localizing time
as these kinds of equivalences.

474
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,030
So they're really is no well-defined
notion a metric.

475
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,365
You really just have

476
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:21,700
it. Why?

477
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,602
Why are we working in topological spaces?

478
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,704
Because the metrics are very subjective.

479
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,906
And so you work topological or

480
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,742
you don't really have a notion of metric,
but you have a closeness condition.

481
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,978
So everyone works logically.

482
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,379
And I'm trying to categorical

483
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,916
by the notion of time and space
needs to throw it into a category theory.

484
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,820
Let's talk about its Morph isms
and how you localize it

485
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,122
and how you invert the Morph isms.

486
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,824
So you need to ask, huh?

487
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,294
You know, so topological spaces,
you have a technology on the space.

488
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,429
So here, right?

489
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,498
With like the diamond,
I put it, you know, like Peter

490
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,902
puts a sheath on a,
you know, in a category like OK,

491
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,406
so what are open sets and a category
that's actually not trivial, right?

492
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,744
Like so, you know, I say the construction
of the top logical localization seems

493
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,745
appropriately meta

494
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,882
in its construction of a reflection of
what is already profoundly many copies.

495
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,551
I say the word V stack.

496
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,453
It's a higher notion of a diamond.

497
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,590
And I'll go into that a little bit later
so the second metric question is

498
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,893
how would you actually put a topology
like on an infinity one.

499
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,128
Category.

500
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,296
That's hard, right?

501
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,732
You have to actually figure out
what the open steps are in a category.

502
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,233
Right?

503
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,169
And so basic points that topology
and like anything in hashrate

504
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,140
is going to go over, you know,
topological spaces and topologies.

505
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,876
But to actually get one on a category
that's not so easy.

506
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,147
So there is something called an infinity
one slight on an infinity one category.

507
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,381
It's the data encoding.

508
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,619
And if any one category of infinity one
sheaves, the sheaves see the pre sheaves

509
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,121
inside a certain category of pre sheaves.

510
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:56,161
So these are just like I said in Chris's
talk, these are like ways of monitoring

511
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,298
kind of local data around the space
she's attached to certain spaces.

512
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:05,237
And so we call a topology
on a category site so what's this

513
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,240
chromatic tower while the chromatic tower
looks like this.

514
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,478
So it's actually there's a whole bunch
of work on chromatic theory.

515
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,448
Just plug in. Listen, but what is that?

516
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:16,982
Right.

517
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,218
It's a way of identifying spaces
using these chromatic towers.

518
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,187
So given this in

519
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,424
this is a blue sphere localization
of what's called a Moravec theory.

520
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,896
So these theories are ways of looking
at isomorphism classes of vector bundles.

521
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,631
You have a wedge some there

522
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,133
and so this

523
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,670
localization gluing, right,
localization is adding inverses.

524
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,074
So given that we call that the hematocrit
limit over the chromatic tower.

525
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,911
So there's a tower of these things
called spectra,

526
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,480
which are objects
that behave like co homology.

527
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,850
Theories and cosmology
theories are exploring holes

528
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,186
in spaces and just kind of data.

529
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,790
Nice invariance about space because
you want to classify these spaces.

530
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,194
And so you have these towers
based on the levels of spectra

531
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,364
so this is this is what I

532
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,300
might say,
the mobilization of a spectrum.

533
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,102
It's that it's pretty detailed, but

534
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,272
we're saying like it's localized
with respect to a certain P.

535
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,976
And so without without like super.

536
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:22,914
Going into the details of that,
do you have towers of equivalencies

537
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,016
and so based on your layer,

538
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:26,785
based on where

539
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,822
you are on the chromatic tower,
is what you're going

540
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:35,660
is how you're going to be navigating
so that's memory space to me.

541
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,396
Recall memory space, it's all the same.

542
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:42,000
Navigating
your Turing degree is, is in a sense

543
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,836
a chromatic tower like this
that create a command type.

544
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:49,174
I'm going to make equivalences
based on the layers of this tower.

545
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,310
So for instance,
if you're on the top layer making a

546
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,780
an equivalence between the top layer

547
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,784
and you know, so replacing home an error

548
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:04,689
replacing but upgrading the home,
it will be type with chromatic type. OK,

549
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,426
so we say for memories
and computer ability.

550
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,729
I said again at that mentation talk

551
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,398
that I just gave not too long ago
at the biological conference,

552
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,268
what else besides computing might
be involved in biological mentality?

553
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,536
Right. I'm just going a little

554
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,007
phenomenological
so we can pull this together.

555
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,577
Well, you know, it's a it's a hematology
type that could be a chromatic type

556
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,247
it precedes by a weak
equivalencies at far exceeds.

557
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,150
There's a lot of like expander graphs
and graph theory that model it.

558
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,152
I just think it's insufficient

559
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,053
and I think that you can

560
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,323
get into these towers
and get a little more of what's going on.

561
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,459
So I also say memory precedes
like an almost apology.

562
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,697
That's a very strict word from
all things, what it means to be almost.

563
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,065
But we can say

564
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,502
that memory has a singular support,
like I told you, like a Cantor set,

565
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,302
and it's what's

566
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:55,073
called a descent condition in my opinion,
which is a gluing right?

567
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,574
So a memory is recall,

568
00:27:56,574 --> 00:28:00,145
and it's putting everything together
so that you can actually localize

569
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,514
at the specific instant,
whatever that is.

570
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,950
So it behaves
more like a descent condition.

571
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,921
So again, a weak equivalence is a class
and morph isms in a specific category,

572
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,256
immutability, right?

573
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,991
So there's a bunch of stuff.

574
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,460
There was huge mess
or awesome in mystery conference

575
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,730
or program

576
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,000
during 2020 about the site ability
to find ability and computer ability.

577
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,702
So computer ability, right.

578
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,004
Is the ability to solve a problem
in an effective manner.

579
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,039
You've got
all these calculus is Turing computable

580
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,276
weaker
automate a stronger hyper computation.

581
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,845
I say you know
I think it's the actual ability to

582
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,980
to construct decent conditions.

583
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,017
So I think we need to take these
very strict terms

584
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,087
about how we navigate
and categorize them.

585
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,356
So you see me kind of adding like,
well why don't we upgrade

586
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,393
that, upgrade the mathematics, use their

587
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,062
defined abilities about structuring
knowledge and concept formation

588
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,299
decide ability say binary decision
problem is the side of there.

589
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,968
Is this an effective method
for deriving the correct answer?

590
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,305
You know,
and this it's very this is very kind of

591
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:01,706
clearly

592
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,809
not, you know, this is not what I
was giving you in the Chromatic Tower.

593
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,245
I think there's more ways
of getting around and saying

594
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,749
things are actually effective if you use
the sort of weak equivalence time.

595
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:11,850
So memory.

596
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,453
So what else besides information
algorithms are involved in biological

597
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,155
intel anyway? A lot.

598
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,192
You've got geometric logic, girdle,
incompleteness, angular support, right?

599
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,495
So I call this in my paper,

600
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,065
Robert, we come up with a nested
hierarchy of awarenesses

601
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,800
and I'll go over that
in about one second.

602
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,402
So I call it a one
to one awareness of capacity

603
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,806
to construct morph isms
between other one awarenesses.

604
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,941
So we're all relating consciousness.

605
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,177
Whatever
it is, is geometrical and relational.

606
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,446
I don't think it's that computational.

607
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,647
So you get this category

608
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,217
all I'm trying to figure out a way, oh,
we know the notion of Turing degrees,

609
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,320
let's
get a categorical notion of that. So

610
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,289
I say

611
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,226
recall your ability to recall
is what's called a localization sequence.

612
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,563
This is a whole fiber sequence
where you have these maps

613
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:04,969
and you have a condition between factors
and what pops out is a fiber.

614
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,472
And so you are given.

615
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,141
So this is what I think is happening
when you actually recall,

616
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,044
you look for a certain state out
pops a memory, right?

617
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,246
So there's a bunch of category theory
going on.

618
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,650
So one of the fundamental units of life,
that's very tricky, right?

619
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:23,521
There's a lot of I think there's a story
about like a beautiful monk

620
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,825
that went up to a hill
to just sort of self defecate

621
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,929
and everyone thought he passed away,
but maybe he had one heartbeat a year.

622
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,598
So my question is like, what?

623
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,501
What is that?
What are the fundamental units of life?

624
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,035
Could it be

625
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,539
that someone slips under the radar
of what we would call metabolic life?

626
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,443
But there's another set of brainwaves
that are maybe mirror

627
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,878
symmetries on the other side.

628
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,582
So like you see, I have this chromatic
tower with everything on the right side.

629
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,351
I want to build a
what's on the left side.

630
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,221
So all of this
I have chromatic towers with right sides.

631
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,189
Yeah.
So maybe this is the condition of life.

632
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,558
What if you reflected on the other side?
What does that even mean?

633
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,061
So again, I'm

634
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,264
playing around trying to figure out
levels of consciousness.

635
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:11,002
So for instance, Clive Waring,
the famous case, awesome pianist, right?

636
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,940
Super brilliant pianist,
got an HPV and got an H.

637
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,645
Mike got a retrograde amnesia,
and so he's got a seven second memory

638
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,414
and he only has motor memory
and no personal memory. Right?

639
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,116
So you can be like

640
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,618
he'll say,
I've never seen a doctor before

641
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,853
in my life,
and he's visited by doctors all the time.

642
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,222
So it's very interesting
with someone like that,

643
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,390
you have to ask the conditions

644
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,959
of what are Clive Waring's
fundamental units of life?

645
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,396
And I literally think you could
you can more easily categorize

646
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,032
what's going on rather than just saying
retrograde amnesia.

647
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,135
Maybe some layers and the tower layers

648
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,805
in the chromatic tower have been gone
and that's what's happening.

649
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,143
So layers in that chromatic tower cut,
then you actually have,

650
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,513
you know, so just like a geometric way
of interpreting all of this.

651
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,549
OK, so let's get to discrete time, right?

652
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,717
So a discrete time.

653
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,153
Why do we model
time is continuous. Like why

654
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,790
again, I think it's an overlook and

655
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,059
I don't think we haven't focused on it.

656
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,362
So why do we model time as a counter
or as the background for some kind of

657
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,198
background dependent model? Right.

658
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,935
What I have pictured here
is what's called a spectral sequence.

659
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,371
And so if time looks like
these series of dogs inside

660
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,474
the dog is encoded
a whole bunch of information about space,

661
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,244
so you can model
time is like a module in space.

662
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,180
And that's what I said
when Chris gave his talk right

663
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,649
so that points
there are not just points, right?

664
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,952
They actually encode other information,

665
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,721
but you can see that
there are gaps between points.

666
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,557
So if you model time is discontinuous

667
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:44,028
or, you know, or democratized,
what's actually in between the gaps.

668
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,065
So then we say, OK, well, quantum
mechanics model space is an honor

669
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,199
median field.

670
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,435
Why is time also not not our comedian?

671
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,669
Why not?

672
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,837
So I open with that question.

673
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,373
What would it mean to phenomenological?
We have a discrete time.

674
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,542
What would exist between like two,
one and 22?

675
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,144
That's really rich what's actually there?

676
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,247
Maybe Susskind would say
that's the pure emergence, right?

677
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,183
He's got the two black holes entangled.

678
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,452
He thinks emergence
comes from the entanglement black hole.

679
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,053
So everyone's looking at that

680
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,456
and then you get paternalism
and temporal parts again.

681
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,560
It tells you where you exist across time,
just like you exist across space.

682
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,397
So, you know, I asked,
why do we experience memory is more?

683
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,965
Is time entangled with memory?

684
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,034
Where does entanglement
end? That's my question.

685
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,903
How would memories
actually exist in discrete time?

686
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,238
That's tricky.

687
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,272
That's tricky, right?

688
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,941
So again, you have someone like me
who thinks

689
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:33,444
there is no personal identity over time,
but yet you have a memory, right?

690
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:33,945
Somehow.

691
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,448
So anyway, so
how would you actually define memories?

692
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,518
And in time, I don't think
there's just one timeline here.

693
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,489
So I put together this theory
where I think you have the

694
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:49,961
the levels of time you have is depending
on the levels of category that you are.

695
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,696
And so I'm going to go over that.

696
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,797
So going to levels of time

697
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,200
that you are able to navigate
depends on your complexity class

698
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,438
and the level of space
that you can actually navigate.

699
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,008
So how would we experience memories
in an end time?

700
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,811
Imagine you had in levels of time
in a tower

701
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,882
so with Roberts in our pluralist
minus paper and also the Perfecto

702
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,786
Diamond Paper, right, we say, you
know, awareness is a it's the I,

703
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,856
we can do it representational and say
it's a representation of a new non,

704
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:23,761
but we also want to throw consciousness
into levels and layers.

705
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,565
So right here
you have a basic notion of a one category

706
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,402
where I have objects
and I have morph isms between objects.

707
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,270
That's it.

708
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,641
So one category is it contains objects
and one more Fisman.

709
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,176
So just a quick category theory

710
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,180
like godmother is beautiful
and I cannot do it justice in 2 seconds,

711
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,650
but I'm given just a little recap
of what we need in the middle.

712
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,653
Here you see a two category
two category contains

713
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,223
objects, one morph isms
and what we call to morph ism.

714
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,393
So to morph isms or morph isms
between the morph isms.

715
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,196
You see,
I have a map here from F one to G two.

716
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:03,067
So this fit and you see,
I have a gamut here from F to to G one.

717
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,237
So that's
this is getting it what I think's right.

718
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,407
So basic basic complexity class can only.

719
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,274
Oh, hi, Daniel.

720
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:10,808
Hi, Sarah.

721
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,010
We have an interaction. That's it, right?

722
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,345
That's super precog.

723
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,380
Is there anyone with Total
Recall like me?

724
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,750
I can put a map between this interaction
and this interaction.

725
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,486
This is what I'm talking about.

726
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,821
A three category three category
looks like this.

727
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,791
You have objects,
you have morph isms between the objects.

728
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,061
You have morph isms
between the one morph isms.

729
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:35,133
And you have a three morph ism, which is
a morph ism between the two morph isms.

730
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,735
So you can see this
step two going this way.

731
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,737
All right,
so this is what I'm saying, right?

732
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:43,341
Depending on your level of category,
your level of awareness,

733
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:48,379
if you are a three awareness creature,
you're able to to navigate this way.

734
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,448
And so that's why I said so.

735
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,451
If you're a three awareness creature,
you live in three time.

736
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,887
If you're a one awareness creature,
you live in one time.

737
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,624
And again, I just I just went onto this
because people like me

738
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:03,661
are either haunted by sad memories
or blessed by amazing memories.

739
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,564
And time for me did not seem to go
linearly it goes like this.

740
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,200
So we have this
for subjective experience.

741
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,769
We have this nested categories
of representation.

742
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,739
You've got a one awareness,
you've got a two awareness.

743
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,075
So that means a category of categories
of representation.

744
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,143
Three awareness.

745
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:24,115
A category of category of categories
of representation in awareness is our top

746
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,985
A categories of categories of categories
so you can see that what what

747
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,822
what does this sort of correspond to
is like, well, me giving you this awesome

748
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:36,394
presentation and being welcome in
your environment and us also

749
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,932
being of the Cambridge Apostles
and having like t you know,

750
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,035
so not just being able to imagine
something like that,

751
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,672
but being able to partition your brain
and split your consciousness

752
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,473
and to actually be able to do that.

753
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:53,511
So I'm all I'm really excited about
splitting consciousness and trying to

754
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,847
physically be in multiple places
because I don't think I don't think

755
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,783
there's only one timeline here.

756
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,151
But to split consciousness,

757
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,186
you'd have to be able to do this
in the brain, you know,

758
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:03,854
which is cool.

759
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,090
So we come up with so along within time.

760
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,091
And so again,

761
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,961
you can see that with the mathematics,
you're able to do a lot of stuff here.

762
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,898
So within time I came up with this
and you know what I think according to

763
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,866
In Time, you have a finite language.

764
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,734
Like what is that?

765
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:21,672
Well, if you know any dairy, donkeys
or anything in his avatar, it's

766
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,976
going to show you that the got somatics
and the Glossiness, you know,

767
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,510
that you're
fundamental units of language.

768
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,613
If you open them up,
there's not a lot there.

769
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,182
But actually the process of reading
is a trace.

770
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:35,219
It's a wild phenomena because you're
pulling together so many pieces.

771
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:39,123
So we actually I came up with this
awesome language scheme that was like,

772
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:43,928
well, you know, and in the one space,
you just have your normal eye.

773
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,897
We me, my mine.

774
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,434
But in end two,
you'd have like a one eye, a two eyes.

775
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,103
This is if you're in two awareness,
right?

776
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,771
If you're in the two category,

777
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,608
then you would have actually like a
one eye to eye, a one me, a two me.

778
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,210
If you're in a three category,

779
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,480
you'd never one, I a two, I have three,
I a one me, a two me.

780
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,485
So instead of just she her,
there'd be like three she three her.

781
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,588
And I think that's the level of intricacy
in the new language.

782
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,025
So getting to some of the physics stuff

783
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,328
and going into the emergent time.

784
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,131
So I came up with this idea
for a perfecto

785
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,466
a dictionary again, perfect spaces.

786
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,469
Our Peter Saul says brilliant work
and I just think it's amazing.

787
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:30,541
And so I do think quantum physics
needs to be a little revolutionized

788
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,578
by replacing Hilbert space with the
perfected space replacing state vectors.

789
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,381
The geometric points
that I just gave this talk at

790
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,686
UCLA's Ipam Entropy Conference
not too long ago,

791
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,989
and I think it was pretty well received
replace the tensor product

792
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,492
with the diamond product based non
locality with finite lemony copies.

793
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,396
It's Farsi replace superposition with
these pro Patel sheaves and for a finite

794
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,733
set the collapse of the wave
function was such so tricky

795
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,903
replace it
with what's called a tilting operation,

796
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,538
which takes this from characteristic zero

797
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,974
to characteristic P and get this awesome
perfect modular curves.

798
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,712
Replace upgrade the holographic principle
with the six functor formalism,

799
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,547
which is a growth and deconstruction.

800
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,750
And I'm about to show you
that you can replace quantum topology

801
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,420
upgrade it with this it tell cosmology
replace operator out again.

802
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,055
It's great,
but you can just upgrade stuff.

803
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,191
So I shouldn't say replace the upgrade.

804
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,594
Let's let's let's let's replace
operator algebra

805
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:29,700
with a non Syrian version
and unitary with a certain descent data.

806
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,204
So you have this this is Peter's

807
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,773
six Functor formalism.

808
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,575
We're in a six functor formalism.

809
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,712
And as a way of making a theory,
I would say really it's,

810
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,319
it's a, a notion of replacing and point

811
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,222
a normal point, correct duality

812
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,192
with a billion sheep column ology and
it's something called verdure duality.

813
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,895
So there's dualities going on here,
which is why I thought it'd be great

814
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,031
to pair it with the holographic principle
because the holographic principle

815
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,703
is really fortified
by one melt is seen as a CFT

816
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,640
proposed duality between

817
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,510
the gravity duality.

818
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,146
So you have this form of case theory
saying that

819
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:19,283
I'm working on of a diamond
and you have these the six operations.

820
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,286
And so with these six operations,
these are just image factors

821
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:26,390
between sheaves and you get this notion,
this is what I'm thinking of.

822
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,228
So in quantum gravity, right
you have the holographic principle

823
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,331
and it's still
very kind of loosely defined

824
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,167
and it says

825
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,504
it's given and only a negative condition
defined by what it's not.

826
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,409
And so I, I think the holographic
principle, instead of having AIDS

827
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,180
anti disorder space in the middle
and the conformal field theory

828
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,349
in the bulk that you could actually have
the six functor formalism in the middle

829
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,219
and the proficiently in many copies
like the diamonds

830
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,888
looking like the conformal field theory.

831
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,690
This is what I'm working on right now.

832
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,425
So emergent time.

833
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,829
So these, these taxis
are higher dimensional diamonds.

834
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,799
And so they're certainly holographic
in a sense that they encode

835
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,503
already for finite many copies of data
that's already multiple on two fronts.

836
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,272
So a V stack is a two sheaves.

837
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,375
So this is like the shoes
that encode local data

838
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,279
so this now it's, it's,
it's one category up.

839
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,316
It takes values and categories
rather than sets.

840
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,053
So you're going to have to shift
to V stack if you want to do this poor

841
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,321
finite language.

842
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,624
So here's a conjecture with Chris and I,
you know, we're trying

843
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,627
to generalize the distinction
between separable and entangled.

844
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,462
This is not easy

845
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,499
so once again, recall that the geometric
points in the diamond amorphous

846
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,467
schemes, there's something called a bear.

847
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,103
Why is Seligman info morph ism?

848
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,938
And this is an ad joint pair.

849
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:49,740
And so

850
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,743
OK, so you have an Agilent pair,
there's a sort of like inverses,

851
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,013
like inverse functions,
but they're functions.

852
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,817
And so we extend this idea to the two
adjoining pairs.

853
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:05,322
This is F Upper Star,
R F Lower Star for the derived category

854
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:09,627
and then F lower shrink and F
upper Schrute shrink is a kind of slang

855
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,594
for the punctuation.

856
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,131
So those are referring to once again
the Peters operations.

857
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,500
So that's the grand correspondence,
right?

858
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,137
Is going to be this this derived
category, which consists precisely

859
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,074
of the hotel sheets of these certain
modules for a small diamond.

860
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,577
OK, so let's get to emergent times.

861
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,512
So what am I going to use all this?

862
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,514
How do I actually pull this together?

863
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,450
So if you consider the simplest case,
we say an event.

864
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,652
What is an event?

865
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,287
A, I'm going to call it a top

866
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,390
a logical localization
of any particular reference frame

867
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,360
event is normally like, I don't know,
simultaneity or something like that.

868
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,029
Try not to use the word slam alternates.

869
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,232
We'll say a top, a logical localization
of somebodys reference frame.

870
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,903
Let's consider that to be a point
in the diamond topological space.

871
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,939
On that point is a certain site

872
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,374
I told you right
this how you're going to get a topology

873
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,678
we're going to call this site
the pro hotel site, the category of pro

874
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,447
finite sets. S So this is from

875
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,252
more Peter's work on condensed
mathematics.

876
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,020
So global time emerges

877
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,991
as a set of continuous mounts
from all pro finite steps as the team.

878
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,628
So again, you have these chopped up
notions of time and you can get global

879
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:21,332
time to emerge
as the set of continuous maps from again

880
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:26,003
the all the pro finite cantore sent back
to t back to the top of logical space.

881
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,907
So all the time can be considered
as a sheaf of sets on this hotel site.

882
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,578
And that's called a condensed set
based on his work with the foursome

883
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,681
so emergent time results
in passing to the larger category

884
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:41,051
of shoes to consider a condensed
version of this is an F construction.

885
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,320
I don't want to go over it
too much at the moment.

886
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,056
So a second conjecture
a way to get an emergent time.

887
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,293
You can actually use diamonds
and take equivalence relations

888
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,329
of those to actually get the V stacks.

889
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,366
So again, when I showed you
the definition of Diamond,

890
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:59,403
you took equivalence relations of you
took protocol equivalence relations.

891
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,606
Well, it's upgrade
and you can take actually equivalence

892
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,576
relations of diamonds
to get modulus spaces of these stacks.

893
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,177
That's pretty big.

894
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,681
So there's new work being done about
how do you actually, you know,

895
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,182
how about a new algebra?

896
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,917
This is Peter and Dustin's new work.

897
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,920
How do you do algebra
and rings and modules carat topology.

898
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,323
I think this stuff is great
and this is where I'm at.

899
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,190
It's like, hey, we need to

900
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,093
rev up mathematics.

901
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,429
You need to upgrade a some physics stuff.

902
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,765
And I think we can all learn from it.

903
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,135
So if you can turn functional analysis
into a branch or community algebra,

904
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,436
that's very nice.

905
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,039
Build a version of algebraic geometry
allows rings

906
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,042
of Convergent
Power series is basic building blocks.

907
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,309
Because my question is

908
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:43,280
how do you actually do analysis
and non r comedian geometry, right?

909
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,250
That's actually kind of tricky
and exciting for a mathematician, right?

910
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,119
So you want to put some kind
of completeness condition on modules

911
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,892
which are like they mimic vector spaces,
but the scalars are not fields.

912
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,095
They can come from the rings,
the coefficient of the rings.

913
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,198
So in such a way that the free objects
behave like some kind of power

914
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:01,999
series instead

915
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:03,467
so you

916
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,104
can construct algebraic geometry,
you can start with in a boolean category

917
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,708
of groups, you have a tensor product,
which is just a way of organizing.

918
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,677
And then you can consider rings
in this sort of category.

919
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,848
You can associate spec
R with the same spar that I showed you

920
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,750
on the diamond and basics,

921
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,554
and open subsets can correspond
to localization so look how cool this is.

922
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,091
You're using Localizations to define
what an open subset is.

923
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,960
Include these figures together along
these open subsets.

924
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,530
You can form these schemes
and accordingly the category of R modules

925
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,899
values to form the category of quasi
coherent sheets.

926
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,935
So again,
this is all Peter's construction.

927
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,036
I think it's great.

928
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,771
How do you construct analytic geometry?

929
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,739
We'll do the same thing

930
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,041
but topological

931
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,276
building groups
don't form in a boolean category.

932
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,679
I will just go over this.

933
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,482
You can use the this notion
of condensed mathematics

934
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,851
to make it make things a little better.

935
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,321
You can replace topological groups
with these condensed sets.

936
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,922
So here's the whole point.

937
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,724
So this definition, right?

938
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,528
The hotel site of a point
is the category of finite set.

939
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,764
So these are counters ish

940
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,666
with finite and jointly subjective
families and maps as covers.

941
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,837
So we say a condensed set
is a sheaf of sets on the pro hotel site.

942
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:14,772
So again,

943
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,308
we're working pro finite and pro hotel
because of the diamond condition.

944
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,211
So similarly, a condensed group

945
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:25,048
ring,
whatever on the proton side is called

946
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,986
that you can put a category together
condensed and condensed objects.

947
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,389
So this means that
this whole thing is a functor.

948
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,125
So you can get a functor
from certain categories.

949
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,927
That's fine.

950
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,996
I don't want to go into this too,
too much.

951
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,732
So given a condensed set,
you can refer to two stars.

952
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,433
It's underlining set.

953
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:48,705
So there's a canonical example that illustrates how you would actually change two

954
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,309
from topological space.

955
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:57,581
So let TV a topological space to t
there's associated a condensed set t bar,

956
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:01,685
and that's defined by sending any
a finite set to the set of continuous

957
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,220
maps from S to T.

958
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,056
This satisfies both properties.

959
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:09,393
It means that for any map
for which the composite is continuous,

960
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,830
it's continuous
so t underline is a condensed

961
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,233
this finite set.

962
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:16,533
Yeah.

963
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:20,370
So y like, why are we using all this pro
finite condition?

964
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,506
Well,
because once again, it's in the language.

965
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,941
I don't want to get lost in the details.

966
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,076
So it's in the language, right?

967
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,645
It's in the awareness.

968
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,281
The level of awareness that you are right

969
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,952
dictates your whole complexity class.

970
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,691
So if and again, if these spaces are pro
finite spaces, right,

971
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,561
then you need to make sure that
what do we mean when we say localized?

972
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,663
We need to make sure we know
what the open subsets are.

973
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,401
And that's why I was using like the pro
hotel site there's that's just one idea.

974
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,903
There's lots of ideas.

975
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,438
So you could model this.

976
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,374
But the main takeaway
that I want to kind of leave

977
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,178
everybody with is like, OK,
so what are memories like?

978
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,046
There is no synchronous reference.

979
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,116
How are we actually getting through time?

980
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,786
Yeah, if every point is desperate times,
you must be getting through

981
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:13,023
time,
you know, through your localization.

982
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:17,060
But I'm trying to try to upgrade
the consciousness level and go, well,

983
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,061
you know,

984
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,465
I think you can actually upgrade
the level of awareness if you can start

985
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:26,770
thinking in terms of morph isms
and morph isms between morph isms. So

986
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:28,338
you get

987
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:31,408
the emergent time phenomena
by using the pro hotel

988
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,278
site, and then you get the diamond
holographic principle

989
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:38,415
by using the six operations and the four,
find out the minute copies like that

990
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,385
so once again,
you get the chromatic types

991
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,289
from looking at these towers of
localization, and you can put this over

992
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,059
a temporal logic to maybe to maybe,
you know, figure out what's going on

993
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,129
with like wiring once again,
like where is the meaning in that?

994
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:53,931
Yeah, OK.

995
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,934
So I put up some of my references
and I think I will just

996
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,602
stop there.

997
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,771
Right.

998
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,773
Awesome.

999
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,908
Thank you so much.

1000
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:08,812
Maybe you can unshared
and then will be really happy

1001
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,515
to ask you some questions for sure.

1002
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,917
All right, Sarah, maybe take it away.

1003
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:15,452
Yeah.

1004
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,022
So so that was a great brain scramble.

1005
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,660
Like, I guess I'm wondering, actually,
this really comes directly

1006
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,895
from philosophy.

1007
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,563
Before I went on this

1008
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,900
livestream,
I was looking at just where topology

1009
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,071
fits into the philosophy of the standard
Stanford Encyclopedia.

1010
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:38,208
And one thing that stood out to me
was was mono logic.

1011
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,913
And I found myself asking,
you know, with all of these new

1012
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,417
topologies or set theory
or however you want to do it, like

1013
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,821
we always kind of run into this tension
between

1014
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,256
these really complicated

1015
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,693
chromium morphic,
whatever kind of morphic

1016
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:59,096
you know, our ability
to conceptualize these morph isms

1017
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,565
and our ability to, like,
make use of them

1018
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,303
or we make these really complicated
math constructs.

1019
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,739
And then at some point
we have to communicate with each other.

1020
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:13,143
And so I'm kind of wondering,
with any math construct,

1021
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,245
it might maybe
even specifically yours, like

1022
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:20,417
how do you see the construct converging,
like looping back,

1023
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,820
you know, conceptually such
that it doesn't just run away from,

1024
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,256
you know, from us
in our ability to understand.

1025
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:27,624
Yeah.

1026
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:28,892
So well, that's why I said so.

1027
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,763
For me, thinking
like those constructs are not difficult.

1028
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,899
I would say the communicating part
is the difficult part, you know,

1029
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,336
like, I mean, you to watch children,
they're all over the place, right?

1030
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:43,306
I think I think you are here to imagine
and then you actually I'm

1031
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,975
like a super synesthete.

1032
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,610
So for somebody like me, right?

1033
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,012
I just rattled that off
and you saw that that was probably

1034
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,247
the easiest thing for me.

1035
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,315
But asking me to maybe replace

1036
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:58,121
a cartridge in an ink like a printer,
that might be really difficult for me.

1037
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,590
So it's interesting that when you say,

1038
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,593
how do we not lose it?

1039
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,228
So I think that's what I was saying.

1040
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,831
I think it depends on
where your brain thrives.

1041
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,299
Like somebody like me,

1042
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,670
I love the thought of like, oh yeah, I'm
definitely a three awareness.

1043
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,441
I want to think of that more prisms
between more prisms and more prisms.

1044
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:21,111
And so I actually don't think
they're difficult.

1045
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,446
I think, you know, it's

1046
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:26,850
something like it's just it's just that
math is just another language, you know?

1047
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,687
And if you're a person
that, like, likes learning new languages,

1048
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,423
I think there is no difficulty around it.

1049
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,394
And so I don't think for me, I don't
think there's anything hindering it

1050
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,465
because I think what's worse
is to leave it in a word statement.

1051
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,601
If you didn't have that math
justifying it, you would just

1052
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,002
have a sentence saying.

1053
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:47,671
What?

1054
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,840
Like the. World is. Unknowable.

1055
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,208
Or something like that. Right.

1056
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:55,779
So I actually think you're just kind of
displacing, displacing,

1057
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,180
you know, you're doing physics.

1058
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,449
Physics is totally hard, right?

1059
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,250
You don't know.

1060
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,153
Like, OK, but let's say, for example,
because in motor logic,

1061
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:07,090
they were just talking about
knowing versus assuming versus, you know,

1062
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,027
so they have these kind of
conjunctive sections in a sentence.

1063
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,764
And and I mean, I don't know,
I think language is actually

1064
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:19,236
the hard thing and actually making math
book into language in such a way

1065
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,806
that we can actually communicate
without exhausting each other.

1066
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,576
You know, like actually make the make
the information transfer

1067
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,947
is, you know, once
you go from like believing

1068
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,050
to assuming you get all these funky like

1069
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,153
predicates or

1070
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,755
you get all these funky
like contingencies.

1071
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,858
And so actually having math such,
you know, that

1072
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,060
that works
with all of these subtleties is like,

1073
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:45,662
I don't know.

1074
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,596
Anyway, that's that's

1075
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,065
where I'm coming from is like,
how do you get a map that doesn't

1076
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,468
that doesn't get, like,
punked by language?

1077
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:53,637
That's funny.

1078
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:53,770
Yeah.

1079
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,705
But isn't it exciting
because you didn't know much about

1080
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,607
topology till I said it, right?

1081
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:59,743
But you're on an exploration

1082
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:03,346
and you're learning more so I don't think
it's actually detracting at all.

1083
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,214
Right.

1084
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,949
No, no. I'm not saying detracting.

1085
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:06,917
I'm saying

1086
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,754
facilitate help like compressing

1087
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,356
and compressing language,
you know, compressing concepts.

1088
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:14,558
Right.

1089
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,862
And I think on my end, I'm not
I think that's might be deleterious.

1090
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,933
I think it might be open them open
all the concepts what's you know,

1091
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,367
I don't think time exists anyway.

1092
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,469
So it's like, what's the rush right now?

1093
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,206
I'm just like,
all right, now, you know what I mean?

1094
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,909
And one note on
that is the linear strings

1095
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,746
spoken or podcast
or live stream or text, right?

1096
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:41,051
They're often ill specified,
but also it enforces a so-called

1097
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,054
temporal structure, a local syntactic
and a semantic structure.

1098
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:49,025
And whether one chooses to see these
these associations as foundational,

1099
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,461
like the routes
that this is growing out of,

1100
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,532
like the previous literature threads,
is it running off away into the dark

1101
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:00,003
forest in literature, or is it actually
anchoring in vast bodies of knowledge?

1102
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,339
So really interesting this discussion.

1103
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,907
Oh, yeah. See, that's a dance.

1104
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:08,878
OK, so how cool that what's natural
for me is like math and literary, right?

1105
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:12,282
So you've got some heavy philosophers
that we're on to, some great things

1106
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:12,782
and I'm like, hey,

1107
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:18,188
why don't we just fortify
what they're saying with some diagrams?

1108
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,155
And you see it's easy

1109
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,626
if I say, oh, maybe five waring's
chromatic, two towers, cut

1110
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:27,030
that in a certain way, like the math part
there is actually

1111
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:31,801
while there is a steep learning curve
you're able to actually get inside of fly

1112
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,604
wearing in a way that you're not in a way
that just like Daniel saying,

1113
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,641
you know, retrograde amnesia. OK, great.

1114
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,175
That's a linear word.

1115
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,279
You need a sentence,
you actually need to go into that.

1116
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,179
What is that?

1117
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:47,083
And so I actually think
language is the key thing.

1118
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:52,255
If it's actually to compress it
and if it's actually not transparent.

1119
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:57,027
There's a beautiful transparency
in mathematics is all there, you know?

1120
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,396
And again,
math is not perfect either. Right?

1121
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,930
There's what is that point?

1122
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,432
We have some serious problems.

1123
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,568
You know, you've got
you've got predictive and then, you know,

1124
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,738
how many definitions in math or self
referencing is horrible.

1125
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,309
You know, so
like math is not to be worshiped at all.

1126
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,645
And that's why it's like, oh,
we should just have all the languages.

1127
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,447
You can see
I talk about everything at once

1128
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,749
and I'm like,
that that's my synesthete, right?

1129
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:23,753
I think there's actually
the beautiful thing about the synesthete

1130
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,324
is that maybe you can see
like an aerial view of things.

1131
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,427
And I think for me,
I can do a local global

1132
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,762
just because of the way
my brain works, you know?

1133
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:33,830
But then I was, you know,

1134
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,633
I was trying because I love
everybody's like differences

1135
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,702
and I don't want anybody to be like
anybody else.

1136
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,772
And I was trying to say like, hmm,
it seems that, you know, maybe

1137
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:46,609
sometimes we're one awarenesses
and sometimes we're one of awarenesses.

1138
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:51,414
But I really I'm really interested in
why like, I don't know how you two are,

1139
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,151
but if like if you have Total Recall
or memories, like,

1140
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:59,723
have you ever had memories just come in
or future memories or deja vu?

1141
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,591
I'm really interested in stuff like that.

1142
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:03,893
Yeah.

1143
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,663
I just wanted to clarify the,
the compression thing, though.

1144
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,698
I want to defend compression
for a minute.

1145
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,468
And normally I would agree,
you know, like the connotation

1146
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,936
with that, I'm like, no, that's bad.

1147
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,637
You throw away a lot of nice subtleties.

1148
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:19,042
But I've definitely felt
in my limited experience with philosophy,

1149
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,144
I've definitely bumped up against

1150
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:24,381
some spots where there have been words
that, you know, somebody once

1151
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:28,218
somebody gets it, what somebody
puts a noun to a concept to a word,

1152
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,152
it's like this

1153
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,689
fantastic compression algorithm
where it's like, Oh, that's a concept

1154
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:37,093
somebody had and they put it into a word
and now I can pack it up

1155
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,963
and like make some more space in my brain
for other stuff.

1156
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,501
And I think that is like that practice,
whether it can be in math

1157
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,771
or in words, like in whatever mean means

1158
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,673
you do, it's, it's just it's the best.

1159
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,910
So I'm always now I'm finding myself
like looking for that,

1160
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,079
for that ratchet thing.

1161
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,913
You would love

1162
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,150
then you would love math, but it's like
because it's all symbols, right?

1163
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,086
But I'm just saying, yeah, I don't see.

1164
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,989
It compressing
doesn't at least not from my brain.

1165
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,426
Like, I can't, I can't like
it doesn't package something up

1166
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,494
so I can make more space
for other things.

1167
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,831
But but it does because it's like, oh,
there's a tower.

1168
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:15,098
So you

1169
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,368
can just keep the tower in your brain
and not the 800 pages that go up there.

1170
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:23,106
Just like when somebody puts a noun
on a concept like anti to sitter space,

1171
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,741
I think.

1172
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,108
Yeah.

1173
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,445
I mean, for me it would be,
I would be deceiving myself to think I'm

1174
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,612
just storing the word.

1175
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,715
You're not, you're
storing all the physics and everything.

1176
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,251
Know, what do you,
what do you think about that?

1177
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:35,685
Right.

1178
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,855
You know, this nesting is a topic
that comes up a lot.

1179
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,658
So we talk about nested
Markov decision processes

1180
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:45,829
how within the active inference model,
just only looking at the mathematics,

1181
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,998
within this one little clade of math,
you can test those models.

1182
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,334
But then there's also nesting.

1183
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:54,671
That's based upon category theory,
not my area, but it seems like

1184
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,740
there's very nuanced ways
of doing nesting and relationships.

1185
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:03,413
And so what I heard with this discussion
around like a sort of a whole

1186
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,182
total system
shift upgrade with a dictionary,

1187
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,987
it's like Synergetic and Bucky Fuller
in that if you understand the interfaces

1188
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,557
interfaces between what these things
are currently doing in the system,

1189
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,760
you can take them out
and like hot swamp them.

1190
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,562
It's like, OK, it's a graphics card,

1191
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,899
we can make it a different graphics card
or we could have the same interface

1192
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,336
and then improve
what's on the other side, the interface.

1193
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,937
And then it turns out to be really better

1194
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,873
because we're working on
active inference,

1195
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:33,610
which is in a way
the theory about how the interfaces work.

1196
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,747
And definitely in the act of inference
live, we're taking a different approach.

1197
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:41,084
But it's like Mount Everest because
we're, you know, meeting at different

1198
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,454
base camps together to talk with people
who have different perspectives.

1199
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,523
Yeah, yeah.

1200
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,560
Which is but that's where everything
thrives is in the intersections, right?

1201
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,594
So that's yeah.

1202
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,931
It's like, look how much stronger math is
when you hit it with philosophy.

1203
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:58,501
Also vice versa or any of this stuff
or any of the bio, right?

1204
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,404
Upgrade retrograde amnesia
to recommend a tower.

1205
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,006
And it's like, whoa, you know?

1206
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,407
So I think, I think

1207
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,310
if nothing is lost in the intersection,
then what did you say earlier about

1208
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,913
what Bucky called Emergence?

1209
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,347
You said something for.

1210
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,050
Emergence through emergency.

1211
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,219
Yeah, it is emergency.

1212
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,255
Like the every time, like survival or

1213
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,258
like what. To actually connect.

1214
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,194
That's what you said about your string

1215
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,598
of natural language
being effortless in active inference.

1216
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:32,435
We think about how the action
is following in some sense actually

1217
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:36,573
on a geodesic a path of least resistance,
like the chemical reaction,

1218
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:40,443
even if it releases a lot of heat
and light in the context that it's in,

1219
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,314
it actually is the most probable thing
or the most energy releasing thing.

1220
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:48,351
The free energy is negative
and so it dissipates and understanding

1221
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,722
how that dissipation can be brought
into the informational regime

1222
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:56,826
with semantic flow and like a Delta
G for semantic information

1223
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,629
rather than just syntax or even chemistry

1224
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,865
that's about this mapping of mappings

1225
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,903
with free energy
as a nomadic concept in a way or a nexus.

1226
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,905
So we connect the free energy
and the chemical.

1227
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,474
We develop certain experiments,
maybe unique predictions.

1228
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:16,512
And then by building the math, that's
general enough to interface nicely,

1229
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:20,450
we actually we test the concepts
so that we can deal with the systems

1230
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,187
that are more syntactic at the lower
level, going down into the quantum,

1231
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,657
even more semantic at the higher level
into the teleological.

1232
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:28,891
Mm hmm.

1233
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:29,659
Good. Yeah.

1234
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,527
And then the semantic
at the higher level. Right.

1235
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,930
Then you can invoke homogeneity
type, chromatic type,

1236
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,266
and then you can actually, you know,
all the types are nomadic as well.

1237
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,868
So I like that, right?

1238
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,937
Nothing is until it actually
like spreads.

1239
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,941
So I also think it's
a false conception of movement.

1240
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,576
If you actually think, you know,

1241
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,512
if you don't start from the
middle and spread, you know.

1242
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,117
Machine
it can we I wonder if we can anchor

1243
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:58,488
some some some exploration
around one of your questions.

1244
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,690
It's on the list. Yeah.

1245
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,026
So like
but I don't remember what they are

1246
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,461
and it might be too much
of a technical hassle to post them.

1247
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:10,533
So if you could like pick one
of the questions that you're breaking up.

1248
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,302
Yeah. Let me just share again
and then you tell me which one you like.

1249
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,537
OK, ok.

1250
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,204
Yeah.

1251
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,910
This will be like the

1252
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,779
Who Wants to be a Millionaire of.

1253
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,313
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1254
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,049
This is cool. Yeah.

1255
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,051
Who Wants to be the Millionaire?

1256
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:28,951
Back to that.

1257
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,421
So we actually do a quick random number
generator.

1258
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,555
Now pick one.

1259
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:34,023
Yeah.

1260
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,361
Just look at a few and then let's anchor
them and then go wild, whatever one.

1261
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,431
OK, so, so actually
now this helps trip my memory.

1262
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,701
So and then don't forget I have these two
so pick which one.

1263
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:45,968
Maybe I can make it.

1264
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,172
Can you see what I can?

1265
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,073
I can

1266
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,077
do to do.

1267
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,112
Oh, I want to do.

1268
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:59,882
I want to do well,
I want to do what is measurement.

1269
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,119
I this is something
I've been tripping out on a bit

1270
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:08,491
so and see so measurement.

1271
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,126
Two to.

1272
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:13,096
Yeah.

1273
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,664
No I know where it is.

1274
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,699
I thought I might pick a second one but

1275
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:21,337
that's definitely should I go with that
and then you bring it on

1276
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,538
or do you want to.

1277
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:25,475
Go on sale

1278
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:25,742
again.

1279
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,745
See all the lovely places

1280
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,646
we're saying what is the,
what is measurement right?

1281
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,448
Yeah. Yeah,

1282
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,117
you tell me.

1283
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,352
Yeah. Well.

1284
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,722
I tend to take

1285
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:42,358
a lot of these I'm
finding that I have an attraction

1286
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,262
to taking a lot of these questions
and putting them in some embodied form.

1287
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,899
That seems to be
I don't know how I'm going to do that.

1288
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,502
In a thesis in such a way
that I actually graduate. But

1289
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,038
this is it's really interesting to me.

1290
01:02:56,038 --> 01:03:01,611
I you know, we have affordances,
we have tools and all these other things,

1291
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,781
these kind of prosthetics
that allow us to make sense of the world.

1292
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,116
But I really just think of them
as prosthetics.

1293
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:07,850
In a sense.

1294
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:12,155
We're we're making sense of the world
by feeling and

1295
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,258
and I mean feeling in the one sense
of like feeling

1296
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,460
whether or not
that actually relates to emotions.

1297
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,928
That's
another really interesting question.

1298
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,130
But you have to be conservative.

1299
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,866
You know, I'm just talking
about feeling like our tactile sense.

1300
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:27,470
And then we use all these affordances
to augment our technical sense

1301
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,740
so it's really interesting
to think about like

1302
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,377
all the subjective measurement
and science and whatnot

1303
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,680
and how that's actually related to
to our embodied

1304
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:41,584
like it won't be true to us at some level
unless we can make two out of it,

1305
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,120
make sense out of it
and an embodied level.

1306
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,389
So that's that, that's is

1307
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:50,293
there is another kind of hook I had in
philosophy, but I can't really remember

1308
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,395
what it is right now,
but that's something that's alive for me.

1309
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,497
So I don't know if you have any thoughts
about it. Mm hmm.

1310
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,300
Yeah. Well,
I'm like super empath, too, right?

1311
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,170
So to, you know, I'm going to dissociate

1312
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,173
the emotional from the irrational, like,
I don't believe in that.

1313
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,643
And they both. Are equally.
They're right.

1314
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:12,181
The rationality is like
the emotional guidance system.

1315
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:16,018
So yeah, when I say like when I say,
what is a measurement?

1316
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:20,523
I'm just saying there's a line
that goes into that that says, you know,

1317
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,793
this is the fixed speed of light
and this is the this.

1318
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:29,665
And so measurement seems like it only
holds up to a certain condition, right?

1319
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:34,470
This is the this is the speed of light
until I change your ambient space, right?

1320
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,506
If you lived on a Taurus
or if you lived on a fine bottle,

1321
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,908
if you lived on something else,

1322
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:39,508
I promise

1323
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,210
you you'd have a different speed of light
because that's

1324
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,279
just the illumination problem
in mathematics,

1325
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:47,049
given a strange space right now,
I put a point source in it.

1326
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,319
What if you trace out
all the rays, right?

1327
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,756
Well, every point in the actual shape
be hit.

1328
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:54,457
Not really.

1329
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:58,194
It won't if you have
a very complicated space.

1330
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:03,399
So for for me, how far
how far does the measurement hold?

1331
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,503
And metrics again, since I'm
such a fan of like topology and sheaves

1332
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:13,743
and things like this, the metric
seems like it is not substantial, right?

1333
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,176
It is.

1334
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:18,214
It is based on, like I said,
intersubjective agreement among agents.

1335
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,715
So when you say,

1336
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:21,751
you know, like,

1337
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,388
yeah, I'm not sure if your question is
like is it objective or subject

1338
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,057
I think all measurements here
are subjective, right?

1339
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,260
And so also there's an actual problem

1340
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,730
in the measurement if you're like strict
Copenhagen and stuff like that, right?

1341
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,134
So nothing should, quote, exist, right?

1342
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,803
If everything is in its free
form of superposition,

1343
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,039
what does it actually mean
to measure something

1344
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,676
without actually limiting the thing
and who is the measurement for

1345
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,946
if you crush the superposition
into like one state?

1346
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,048
I've measured it, right?

1347
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,215
I don't know what that means.

1348
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,419
And I also think that the minute
all your observers go away, that

1349
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,288
the thing that was measured
goes back into its original state.

1350
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,958
So that's why I said, like,
what is a measurement?

1351
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,895
And Chris and I are always talking
about this right that that assumes

1352
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:09,031
that you are somehow independent
of the thing that you're measuring.

1353
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,767
And I don't know how to actually do
that. Right.

1354
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:15,338
I don't really know what a boundary is
because if you zoom in to your arm,

1355
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,473
we could take like an electron
transmission microscope

1356
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,242
and I'd be able to zoom into your arm
in like 2 seconds.

1357
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:24,246
So where the boundary go, you know,
where is the boundary

1358
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:27,483
and that I'm I'm very perplexed

1359
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,820
because the boundary in mathematics
is like some kind of asymptote, right?

1360
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:32,588
What is an mass like?

1361
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,891
You know, so are you dealing with
sort of a asymptotes?

1362
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,327
And that's that's
what we're calling a measurement.

1363
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,731
You're like a bus is this long true.

1364
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,601
Until I subject the bus to a lot of time
or I for gasoline

1365
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,403
on the bus and burn it,
you know what I mean?

1366
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,772
So how long does the measurement hold?

1367
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,676
You know
yeah I would that so so you're yeah.

1368
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,812
So I hadn't thought so much about context
and feeling.

1369
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,714
I was definitely like it's a fixed thing.

1370
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,683
So that's that's useful to think about.

1371
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,418
Not really like fixed according to him.

1372
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:06,322
Fixed for that second but like,
everything is in freefall.

1373
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,056
And like, you see,

1374
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,459
I really think there is nothing
periodic here.

1375
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,161
I think there is no repetition. Right.

1376
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,731
We have to actually account for like
what, leap year or something, right?

1377
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,034
Because the calendar is off.

1378
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,270
So I'm really I'm really impressed that

1379
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:24,673
in our like in everybody's free fall
and you know what?

1380
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,410
The Earth is going
a thousand miles an hour east, right?

1381
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,447
And if everything is rotating,
your own cells are popping in and out.

1382
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,482
Where is the measurement?

1383
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,418
I'm not sure nothing is fixed.

1384
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:39,488
So it's very silly
to think that I have this measurement.

1385
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,858
It's like if you only knew
that you were actually

1386
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,162
working over discrete time
and that moment,

1387
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,798
the moment that you were measuring
the buzz is no longer there.

1388
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:49,498
Right?

1389
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,201
So that's
what I'm very, very interested in.

1390
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:56,439
I measured the bus 5 minutes ago,
but is it the same bus? No.

1391
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,441
And I don't know what that means.

1392
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,543
So that's like,
what are you actually measuring?

1393
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,012
We can measure
proficiently many copies of the thing,

1394
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:06,482
but you need to say that the measurement
is of the reflection of the thing.

1395
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,152
And that's that's the one thing I do like
about the temporal parts work

1396
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:13,923
is that the bus yesterday
is it really the bus today?

1397
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,324
I don't know.

1398
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,559
And I've always been

1399
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:20,296
I've always been perplexed that,
you know, you wake up to the same space.

1400
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,598
But do you really? I'm not really sure.

1401
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,700
And so that's, you know,

1402
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,535
boundaries.

1403
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,472
I'm really interested in boundaries
and like how they actually.

1404
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,440
How they work.

1405
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,875
It's not really sure they do it quickly.

1406
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:37,913
Like I can hit my hand on a on the glass,
but that's just that's at this scale.

1407
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,115
Right.

1408
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,183
If I so I'm just saying
that a measurement

1409
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,253
if you're going to say a measurement,
then you need to be real precise.

1410
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,622
I mean, there's no time involved.

1411
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,824
There's no
this involved. It's only at an instant.

1412
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:50,793
So this measurement holds at an instant.

1413
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,795
Because tomorrow, who knows?

1414
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,363
And what's up with the measuring stick?

1415
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,331
Like there's so many

1416
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:58,000
like quantum mechanically that either
sick doesn't exist anyway.

1417
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,671
So so I don't even know how to use
all these friggin philosophical labels,

1418
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:09,145
but I want to ask if your ambition
in, in trying to apply

1419
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:15,651
to topology as kind of a paradigm
is to arrive at some form of realism

1420
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,253
or are you interested in

1421
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,689
I mean, I'm kind of wondering what your
ground is in terms of like,

1422
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,393
yeah, what would be the

1423
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,330
what's the end goal in terms of like what
would be the perfect math in your mind?

1424
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,432
Like where would it take you right.

1425
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,135
Yeah. Well, I'm after those grand
unified theories, right?

1426
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:37,106
So I'm after the I'm after the unifying
the grand unified theories of physics

1427
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,642
with the grand unified theories of math
because I actually think

1428
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,911
the math one encompasses the physics.

1429
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,447
That's why you see me going, hey,
why don't we look at like a number

1430
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,917
theoretic version of a black hole,
something like that.

1431
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:52,521
Because I think that in the grand unified
theories of math, I'm big at everything

1432
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,891
because I'm a super TEGMARK
like level four.

1433
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,626
But you're going to
you're going to get everything.

1434
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,495
You're going to get
you're going to average.

1435
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:00,663
What are you going to get?

1436
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:01,063
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:01,764
Well, that's how I say

1438
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,533
like, oh, well, are you calling reality
like just this little blip?

1439
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,404
You got to remember that I believe in
like in consciousness, right?

1440
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:13,075
So my goal is to actually partition
the brain, partition the consciousness

1441
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:16,478
so that you can actually experience
everything at once again.

1442
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,682
I don't believe in linear time
I don't think it goes linearly.

1443
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:23,018
And I'm really baffled
why the brain only does that.

1444
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:27,156
And I think it does not because I know
when you're freshly formed like

1445
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,191
a baby, it's a

1446
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,028
very it's such a beautiful being because,
you know, she's like a little portal.

1447
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,730
I'm like, where did you come from?

1448
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,200
You know, like the very act of birth
is something interesting

1449
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,238
because it seems like it's something
that got through the interface, right?

1450
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,573
Where did this little portal come from?

1451
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:49,044
And I'm actually I'm not so interested
in the mechanics of the interface.

1452
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,714
I'm interested
in breaking through the interface,

1453
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,250
taking off the interface
and trying another one.

1454
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,885
Because again,
I think the two fundamental numbers

1455
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:00,456
and everything that you're subjected to
here and the laws of physics or whatever

1456
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,727
are just purely interface space, which
I which I think as a mathematics concept,

1457
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,931
it would be so rad if we were all able
to take off the interface

1458
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:13,902
of this complexity of this of our current
complexity and go somewhere else.

1459
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:15,671
I don't mean Milky Way,
I don't mean that.

1460
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:19,508
I mean leave this interface
altogether of three type of three space

1461
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:22,544
at one time
and go find a different module's space.

1462
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,379
Right?

1463
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,847
And that's
what I'm trying to do is I'm like,

1464
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:28,050
Oh, if you could actually partition
consciousness, right?

1465
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,420
Because it seems like I don't know
if you all had like general anesthesia

1466
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,922
or like if you've ever fainted
or anything.

1467
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,826
I have like a few times
just from like kind of intense things.

1468
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:40,863
But I remember something remained.

1469
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,866
It's like you might have wiped out
the consciousness

1470
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,968
by a general anesthesia, right?

1471
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,337
But you didn't take away the awareness.

1472
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:52,041
And that's what I was very curious about,
that something was still there.

1473
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,911
And so Don Hoffman and like me, it's
like I'm

1474
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,614
actually interested
in what that space is, right?

1475
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:01,083
The kind of talking sensory thing.

1476
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:06,155
Like, I can see that as an apparatus,
but I'm interested in like the divinity

1477
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,490
or whatever,
the infinity, not in a religious sense,

1478
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:13,028
but like what actually transcends this,
because I don't think anything here is

1479
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,897
like real at all, you know?

1480
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,299
So when people say,
what's your baseline reality?

1481
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,334
Well, it's not this.

1482
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,003
I'm really always curious
to get in the dream space.

1483
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,306
I'm really always curious
to, quote, sleep, because

1484
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,144
when I'm asleep, who's asleep, you know,
your body is not asleep, right?

1485
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,246
Because you would die.

1486
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,183
So I'm really curious in the states
that are actually

1487
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:38,520
I guess I could say like this, I'm
trying to take subjectivity

1488
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,091
out of the interface
and put it in a different setting.

1489
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,994
I'm going to have subjectivity limited by
just what the body can do

1490
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,129
because there's a lot of pain.

1491
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:51,367
A lot of pain keeps people in the body
when I think you could actually be like

1492
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,701
somewhere else, you know?

1493
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,904
So if you could take subjectivity
on its own exploration,

1494
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,574
which is what I think
mathematics is really good about doing,

1495
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:02,444
like if I can have, you know,
people like, oh, let's

1496
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:06,415
think about similar like what if,
what if we were actually here?

1497
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,485
And also,
you know, at a Cambridge Apostle meeting,

1498
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:13,522
that baffles people because, you know,
you have this imagination, right?

1499
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:16,558
We're able to talk and you're,
you know, I can say, oh, Sarah,

1500
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:20,295
it let's imagine like we're in Hawaii
swimming with the sea turtles.

1501
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,664
You can go there just like that.
What is that?

1502
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,333
Why can you do that?

1503
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,402
What is that imaginary space?

1504
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,471
So I actually think we're actually
really gifted creatures.

1505
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,673
And you have this beautiful tool

1506
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:35,010
called the Imagination,
which has not been fortified.

1507
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,347
So what I'm trying to do
is actually put the imagination

1508
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,417
in its own little Hogwarts school, right?

1509
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,452
Like when you're young,
you're able to do plays

1510
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,854
and you're doing all this,
and then you go up and it's like taxes

1511
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:49,291
and like they're up and it's like, no,
I actually think we're here

1512
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:50,459
to be creative.

1513
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,895
And you can see all the philosophers
that I like are vital.

1514
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,029
Is right.

1515
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,632
And so I think being is creation.

1516
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,200
So you can see that I'm here, too.

1517
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,704
I think we're here to create new theories
and to break through the interface.

1518
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:05,874
Now, that I'm not saying
people go jump in front of busses.

1519
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:06,975
That's not what I'm saying. Right?

1520
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,112
I'm saying
it'd be cool to peek through it.

1521
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:14,149
Just sort of like how a new baby arrives
I am perplexed at birth.

1522
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,684
Nobody can explain it.

1523
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,420
And you have no idea,
like how something broke through.

1524
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,022
Yeah, the interface.

1525
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,491
So we're, I'm after with that
you see, I'm using

1526
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,260
very beautiful mathematics,

1527
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:31,033
I think I think life is very sacred
and very beautiful and it should be

1528
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:35,070
supported and and explained

1529
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,340
by an equally sophisticated
mathematical structure.

1530
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,641
So I don't really abide by this.

1531
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,478
The simplest version is the best.
I don't know about that.

1532
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:46,348
I actually think that what is
what is sophisticated philosophically,

1533
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:49,384
it should be equally matched
in sophistication mathematically.

1534
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:54,056
And then you get a synergy and a harmony
and actually then you can actually

1535
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:57,426
explain a grand unified theory
because I really think,

1536
01:14:59,294 --> 01:14:59,661
you know, if

1537
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,564
everything is a diamond,
which I really think it is

1538
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:06,568
you know, there's a lot of
I think if this reality is like a modulus

1539
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,339
space of diamonds, then I can just easily
jump to a new modular space.

1540
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,908
It's not that difficult. You know,

1541
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,943
I don't know if that sounds like
you're like, who is this little part?

1542
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,513
Oh, yeah, I'm totally like an explorer.

1543
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,749
I'd be like, Let's jump in the
consciousness bus and go look at stuff

1544
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:23,685
because it's not just this.

1545
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:27,723
It's not just
what is your awareness never leaves.

1546
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:31,293
And it's awesome to kind of enter
that space, you know,

1547
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:33,996
and actually like bring it here.

1548
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,065
If you can actually
bring the consciousness space to here,

1549
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,468
then you're actually more synesthetic,
I think, you know?

1550
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,337
Yeah, because I don't know where one

1551
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:46,742
scale ends in the brain seems to be,
you know, the hologram itself.

1552
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,178
So when everything when
your central processor is a hologram,

1553
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,615
it makes me really curious about what
this space is.

1554
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,054
I definitely don't think the brain
is like this, you know, of course,

1555
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,023
you don't want to get hit in the head,
obviously,

1556
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:04,293
but it's freaky ability
to rewrite, right?

1557
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,061
It's like a super hamming codes.

1558
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:06,662
You've got like error

1559
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:10,032
correcting code in the brain, obviously,
to keep the organism alive, you know,

1560
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,502
but I think, you know, to come up with
like a,

1561
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:16,538
you know, you know,
like the Zeta function is a black hole.

1562
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,040
Like, that's cool.

1563
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,075
So I'm just kind of trying to upgrade,

1564
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,478
you know, find
what is the essence of things.

1565
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,614
And it's like,
oh, is it math what is this? You know.

1566
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,817
The essence.

1567
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,688
I'll ask one question, which is,
you know, how would you imagine that

1568
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:37,292
this insight or this set of upgrades
potentially being taught

1569
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:41,330
to advanced or younger students
could change research or practice?

1570
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,965
Because I noticed words like descent

1571
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:46,602
condition, define ability,
decide ability, completeness, of course.

1572
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:52,874
So where do the sort of everyday
usages of these terms come into play

1573
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:56,345
with how we can rethink them
based upon a new level of mathematics?

1574
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,145
Or rigor?

1575
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,614
Oh, that's such a great question.

1576
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,850
Yeah, I'm such an advocate
for like new models of pedagogy, right?

1577
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:05,454
Because I think the way
mathematics is taught now is formal

1578
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,590
and it makes everyone frightened.

1579
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,426
It's like you're taught calculus
first before logic,

1580
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,796
before topology, before any of it.

1581
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,132
Right. And so it seems like

1582
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,202
people are not using the Apostle book.

1583
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,871
That should be the only book use
for calculus.

1584
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:23,171
Yeah.

1585
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:26,942
So if you actually,
if you taught category theory

1586
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:32,147
straight from the bottom up,
imagine the beautiful connections

1587
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,716
that would be able to be made
cross-disciplinary.

1588
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:38,153
You can see that one of my main goals
is to get people to talk with each other,

1589
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,421
get the mathematicians

1590
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,124
to talk with the physicists,
to talk with the philosophers.

1591
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,328
I think through category theory,
he would naturally embody

1592
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:50,032
this synesthete thinking, which is what
I'm trying to be an advocate for

1593
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:54,069
because there's people like nonlinear
thinkers like me that can be easily

1594
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:57,339
shunned and didn't say, well,
she works at the intersection.

1595
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,741
She's not serious about the one topic.

1596
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,210
And I'm like,
But the one topic is a reflection

1597
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,413
of the other topics
when everything is a diamond.

1598
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:08,884
So for me, I see that if you were
introducing these beautiful words

1599
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:13,488
like a decent condition and like
if you start from category theory,

1600
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:18,293
which is so minimally constructed
and only and allows you to

1601
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:22,264
and what you need
to build your own space, right?

1602
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:25,801
You are you are able to build

1603
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:27,903
I would say

1604
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:31,840
you're able to to build in accordance
with your own idea

1605
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,944
versus taking another idea and chiseling
it away and adding things artificial

1606
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,848
The nice thing about category theory
is that these limits, everything is built

1607
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:43,485
into the actual theory itself.

1608
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,553
I'm not starting

1609
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,457
with something and adding and then adding
and then adding and then taking away

1610
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,059
and being like, well, is it analysis
or is it like this?

1611
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,461
So you see there's

1612
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:56,231
there's all these ways and like Peter's
just like reconstructing you know,

1613
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,700
functional analysis
as commutative algebra.

1614
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,202
That's super synesthete.

1615
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:03,205
I guess what you're doing is like taking
what you thought

1616
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,241
was a difference and you're actually
making it the same thing.

1617
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:11,313
So I'm such an advocate for inclusivity
and welcoming so many trains of thought.

1618
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:16,518
And if everyone was like, Oh, hey, no,
that looks like just a morph ism of this.

1619
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:20,222
And this is like a more physical this,
it would actually aid research

1620
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,858
because everybody would be working
together,

1621
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,594
you know, like,
can you imagine like new antidotes?

1622
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,231
And, you know, I'm like a mental health
advocate and because,

1623
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:31,600
you know,
there's been a lot of stuff like,

1624
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,503
I don't know, I'm sure everyone has that,
you know, elderly family members

1625
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,305
go through
some horrible neurodegeneration.

1626
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:41,476
And I am not satisfied with the way
that the brain is being modeled.

1627
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:44,513
And I'm like, you know,
if you actually were using the morph isms

1628
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,682
or the chromatic tower idea,
maybe it would be able to understand

1629
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,217
what's actually going on in

1630
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,954
somebody, you know,
and we'd be able to relate to them

1631
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:57,626
empathically instead of just like this,
like clear cut medicinal thing.

1632
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,828
Well, they'll never be good again.
They lost their memory.

1633
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:04,065
Well, we can you know, I don't think
it's something that can be lost

1634
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,902
let's just try to reconstruct
the Morph isms, you know,

1635
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:12,641
so there's like there's so many things
that I'm after with this one is unifying

1636
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:16,111
all these branches
that are working against each other.

1637
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,412
It's like when the mathematicians

1638
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,848
and the physicists
honestly work together, right?

1639
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,984
If they can
and not everyone's egos in the way,

1640
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,886
then the beauty that results,

1641
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,490
you get these beautiful grand
unified theories because it's like

1642
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,593
we're meant to be inclusive
and everybody to help each other.

1643
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,695
And so everybody knows that, like,

1644
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:36,031
you know, not an advocate
for these like standardized tests.

1645
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,933
And I'm going to test
you and I'm better than you.

1646
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,936
And like, I don't know why we test people
to be better than everybody.

1647
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,672
We could actually be
working on things like that.

1648
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:48,643
So I think it would completely
revolutionize pedagogy and it would offer

1649
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:53,081
a future model of like what
a what a Hogwarts would look like.

1650
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:58,386
Because then you're actually like, OK,
hey, we have the imagination as a gift.

1651
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,722
It is a gift that you have this.

1652
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,159
And so through what I'm trying
what I'm doing here, it's

1653
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,996
like a very creative take at learning
mathematics and things like that.

1654
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:12,601
So then you've actually
welcomed into mathematics

1655
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,571
those underrepresented
who identify as creatives.

1656
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,673
Now, I also teach at this art school

1657
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,309
and I was like, Well,
I don't have the best math gifts.

1658
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,445
And I'm like,
But look at your visuals skills.

1659
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:27,282
And at a certain sense
they're almost the same, you know?

1660
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,619
So I think there's a lot of beauty, like
it's like diamonds and things like this.

1661
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:34,189
We're taught very early
or even to like a lot of people,

1662
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,726
you know, if you can integrate this
into the research, then you would.

1663
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,562
I just think there's beauty in everyone
working together.

1664
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,564
I'm not a very
competitive person. You know.

1665
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,335
So they

1666
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,472
reminded me of how could you imagine

1667
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,207
a way that

1668
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:54,743
that art

1669
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,712
could actually inform math
rather than the reverse?

1670
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,715
Like not not just art, but like improv.

1671
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:04,052
Improvization Improvizational
arts of somebody drawing just free form.

1672
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,889
And if you could figure out a dynamic
mapping of like,

1673
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:12,060
oh, you're actually talking about this,
this kind of logic

1674
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,996
and you don't and you're drawing it,
but you're not you're not putting it to,

1675
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,665
you know,
you don't even know that you need that.

1676
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,467
But you mean that
that is actually kind of fascinating.

1677
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,835
Look how beautiful that is.

1678
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,904
Yeah, I just got accepted.

1679
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,675
What you just said is,
you know, I'm an advocate for pedagogy

1680
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:27,742
in the creative setting.

1681
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:31,379
So I'll do I'll do experiments like that.

1682
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:36,918
All the time, like their topic is
to design a four dimensional university.

1683
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,920
I want a four dimensional university.

1684
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,357
I want a gymnasium featuring
flying lessons right.

1685
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:43,992
And I want a library.

1686
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:48,363
And I want you to talk about a Dinkas
or Tinkers or James Gates

1687
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:49,898
air correcting codes.

1688
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:50,865
These students, right?

1689
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:54,536
Have minimal mathematic skills,
but they are in there learning,

1690
01:22:54,903 --> 01:23:00,075
analysis, geometry and topology
to actually make a structure

1691
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,711
that can hold flying lessons.
They're actually having

1692
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:06,448
to teach themselves
a four dimensional coordinate grid.

1693
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,049
That's not Euclidean.

1694
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,417
This is not Euclidean at all.

1695
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,453
It's differential geometry right?

1696
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,021
It's bumpy.

1697
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:13,955
And I said, you know,

1698
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:16,725
because it's four dimensional
and they only have hyper volumes.

1699
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,728
So how amazing that it's sort of like,

1700
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,498
you know, for me, it's very sad
that it's only a super exclusive, like,

1701
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,534
you know, like the Exeter Academy
that has this Harkness method.

1702
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,971
So what I do is I take the Harkness
method and I speak it everywhere.

1703
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:30,572
Right?

1704
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,241
I teach it at Cal State,
I teach it here and all over the place.

1705
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,611
And that method of showing of

1706
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:41,583
of giving a consent synergistically
like that and showing, you know,

1707
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,719
just giving minimal instruction,
they're learning that themselves.

1708
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,522
And so it's like, you know,

1709
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:51,259
so I'm interested in other people
who want to experiment like that.

1710
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:52,861
You don't learn of chapter one.

1711
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:56,598
This is a triangle,
you know, nobody learns like that

1712
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:00,769
because the way that you actually learn
is to integrate so, you know,

1713
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:05,173
why do students have so much problem,
so many problems solving work problems?

1714
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,742
Because they've been taught
these subjects separately.

1715
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,911
These subjects are not separate at all.

1716
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,014
They should be taught,
integrated in a holistic manner.

1717
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:14,182
And you're totally right.

1718
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:15,183
They're the way to get

1719
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:19,020
holistic manner, like easily
digestible is in a creative way.

1720
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,989
I showed my students like a

1721
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,692
this awesome computer programmer
solving a 40 Rubik's Cube.

1722
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,262
I said, recreate that.

1723
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,731
And they actually had it 04
dimension does this.

1724
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:30,665
Oh, it's a test.

1725
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:34,969
Oh, it has that many sides
so much easier than a very linear lesson.

1726
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,938
This is a force space.

1727
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,908
But there you know, I think I think

1728
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,246
you know if you're an into it like me
and most math comes from this intuition

1729
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:49,951
space need to honor that intuition
space and I I really think it's shun

1730
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,154
so there's mathematicians like Ramanujan
and stuff like that who was saying

1731
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,257
I don't know where this idea came from
it just came from this

1732
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:59,294
and you know that can be really shunted
and so but

1733
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:03,031
I think a lot of this visionary stuff
comes from

1734
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:08,837
like a nonspecific space and oh my God,
I will nurture people's creative space.

1735
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,674
Look, how many ideas come out
when you do some kind of like fun

1736
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,342
icebreaker like that, right?

1737
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,345
So any time I host a conference or
something, you know, I, you know, I'm

1738
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,381
like you know, imagine we were, you know,

1739
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,784
alligators, you know?

1740
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,386
So I had people change the space.

1741
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,020
If you change it.

1742
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,656
Oh, you know, you had claws,
what would you do with these pods?

1743
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:29,324
You know?

1744
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:32,794
And so it's like
if you can kind of shake up,

1745
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,363
you know, the real
and turn it into something

1746
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,234
kind of imaginary,
I think the imagination is more real.

1747
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:43,471
So for somebody like me, I'm privy to the
imaginary space because like this pen,

1748
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:46,141
I think there was an idea of a pen
before the pen.

1749
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,944
So the pen is OK, in my opinion,
but I still think the imaginary

1750
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,846
space trumps everything, right?

1751
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:55,550
You had to have the idea of the car,
and I want to have the idea of the thing.

1752
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,653
So I put a lot of my efforts
into nurturing,

1753
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,890
like students, imaginary space,
you know, so.

1754
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,325
Oh, my God. Yeah. Infusing, like having.

1755
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:07,295
You can teach math in a creative way.

1756
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,932
And that's why I'm so excited
that there are these people like me.

1757
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,802
You know, I write books and it's like,
oh, it's like, I'm going to write.

1758
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:16,371
I'm going to write, you know,

1759
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,707
I'm going to write a girl an indictment.

1760
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:19,941
I'll write.

1761
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:23,711
Like, my opening line is, like, my new
book is like, she slept in an hourglass.

1762
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,413
Why not write?

1763
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:26,814
So that's what you're doing anyway.

1764
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,950
And it's like, oh, wait through glass.

1765
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:29,951
What is that?

1766
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,120
So I can actually give you a shape.

1767
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,222
I can introduce the shapes
you creatively,

1768
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,256
and then I can actually

1769
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:38,927
tell you theorems about the shape but
I didn't start with the theorems, right?

1770
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:43,298
I started with this rough, intuitive idea
that actually had a texture to it.

1771
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:44,432
So people.

1772
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:46,434
But what does it like to sleep
in an hourglass?

1773
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:48,970
God, does it get eaten by the sand?

1774
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:49,971
Am I the sand?

1775
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:52,740
Is somebody turn me over?
What happens when the time runs out?

1776
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:53,775
You know?

1777
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:58,179
And so through people's own
introspection,

1778
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,550
I get some really solid thinkers,
and that's what I'm after.

1779
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,818
I'm not after people wrote

1780
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:07,689
memorizing and like, wrote test tests
of course, are difficult.

1781
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:08,056
Right.

1782
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,959
But it's how many people
remember the material after it?

1783
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,227
You know, how long I have one?

1784
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,829
So memorizing through rote
is not what I'm into.

1785
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:18,299
I'm into actually building
the inner space, inner space

1786
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:22,604
of independent learners who can think
and who can cross reference.

1787
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:27,842
Because again, I will just always say
that your strongest thinkers or thinkers

1788
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:30,945
who can think along
all of those intersections, right?

1789
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,515
If there is a problem
like the rover crashes.

1790
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:35,116
Yeah.

1791
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,585
You need your CSP
but you also need your physics people.

1792
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:38,553
You need your math people.

1793
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:42,457
And that's why, you know,
normally those research groups have that.

1794
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:43,925
I don't know.

1795
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,127
And then you may have
that to write in your labs

1796
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,096
I bet you have people from all discipline
areas

1797
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,764
working on the inference stuff, right?

1798
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,933
Each species of every type of insect.

1799
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:56,237
Well, our approach with active inference
lab is provide

1800
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:59,607
the affordance
and the opportunity to co-design

1801
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,645
and wherever people are at in learning
about active inference

1802
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:07,715
or are curious about related topics
or wanting to apply it in some domain,

1803
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:13,321
we just sort of meet in the middle
and work to use active inference

1804
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,824
as a unifying topic and a bridge
because it

1805
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,562
and that's really that's why you're here,
because we actually got to intersect

1806
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:25,566
with active inference
coming to me, all these other ideas

1807
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:29,570
and what you said about the book reminded
me of Bucky Fuller's Tetra Scroll,

1808
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,640
which is about the Goldilocks
and the Three Bears,

1809
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:37,178
but the four of them are a tetrahedron
and so it talks about how the tetrahedron

1810
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:38,713
is the minimal system.

1811
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,616
And there's all these tetrahedral jokes
that are embedded in.

1812
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,417
So it's like learning

1813
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:46,354
by doing and through stories
and through characters and by drama.

1814
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:50,058
So all these creative dimensions
that allow us to actually

1815
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:53,094
be generative within so-called alternate.

1816
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:56,731
But today's alternate fashion
is tomorrow's, you know, out of date.

1817
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:59,300
And then it just it's historical.

1818
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,803
So how do we respect rigor

1819
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:05,073
as well as this
very radically intersubjective

1820
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,442
like you're talking about with agents
with different perspectives.

1821
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:10,712
But then also we need local logics
that aren't just totally discordant,

1822
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:14,082
because then when we're talking about
the systems that sustain us,

1823
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:17,552
we need those to also persist.

1824
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,520
So how do we how do we?

1825
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,857
That was my question is
how do we unify the rigor and the sort

1826
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:26,361
of almost transcend it, or at least
if not universal, something like that

1827
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:30,398
with intersubjective definitions
on the mortal plane.

1828
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:31,666
Right.

1829
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,202
And you can actually see right in my talk

1830
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,637
I didn't give you some kind of loose map,
very particular.

1831
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:37,405
Right.

1832
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:40,208
So I think I'm actually rather
gifted in that regard.

1833
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,110
Probably why I got heart so quick
with all this stuff

1834
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:46,047
is that I'm able to introduce
an idea in a creative way,

1835
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:49,350
but I give you absolute rigor
so that you know it through and through.

1836
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:50,385
Right?

1837
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,187
But I give you enough
rigor to know that object.

1838
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:55,056
But I also endow you with the creativity

1839
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,392
to be able to intersect it
somewhere else else.

1840
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,594
So we all say the mortal plane, right?

1841
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:02,196
But you won't really be aware
when you pass away.

1842
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:05,933
And you already could have you
can't prove that you exist anyway, right?

1843
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:09,036
So I'm like, yes,
respect your life force.

1844
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:09,670
Yeah.

1845
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,906
But don't ever think
that you're not infinite

1846
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:14,375
because there's no proof
that you aren't right?

1847
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:18,012
So there's this structure, like
there is no structural causality.

1848
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:21,249
You know, you go somewhere,
but you will never be aware of it.

1849
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,318
And I all I always say
when people ask me that, how do we

1850
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:27,455
how do we take your,
your lovely, your lovely,

1851
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:29,056
you know,

1852
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:32,627
kind of goodies from the higher plains
and like works with them here.

1853
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:34,595
And I'm like, well,
the higher plains are here.

1854
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:35,830
You're in them, right?

1855
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:39,767
It's not like it's outside of you,
like you're born from the very universe.

1856
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,636
It's all in you.

1857
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:44,005
And it's sort of like I remember
when I was trying to say,

1858
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:46,974
like, would you actually be aware
when you pass on what you want?

1859
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:47,542
Right.

1860
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:50,011
That's that that's strange.
That's very strange.

1861
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,814
So it seems to be this, like, impasse
limiting thing

1862
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,284
all the more to value
your imaginary space.

1863
01:30:56,551 --> 01:31:00,087
Like, I know when I'm trying to go
to sleep and I'm like, I'm like, I'm,

1864
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:03,224
I'm going to actually be aware
when I actually go to sleep.

1865
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:04,158
You're not right.

1866
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,327
When you go to sleep, you just you wake
up, right?

1867
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:09,464
You're never actually, like,
aware of the moment you go to sleep,

1868
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:11,065
right?

1869
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:12,567
And I'm like, oh, that's very strange.

1870
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,936
What is this awareness phenomena? Right?

1871
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:16,938
So yeah, there is the AI.

1872
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,974
And so when people call it Mortal Planet,
I guess I call it the interface.

1873
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,176
That's one possible interface.

1874
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,278
But again, babies can reach through it.

1875
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,281
And I also think there's other ways
of getting other interfaces.

1876
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,650
Yeah. So how do you balance the rigor?

1877
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:33,554
Is that well, I'm giving you some of the
taught mathematics on the planet.

1878
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:34,155
Yeah.

1879
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:38,125
So that rigor,
you have to be for your own integrity.

1880
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,629
And as a pedagog and an intellectual,
of course you are

1881
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:44,732
you're here to make the planet
better for everyone.

1882
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:50,371
So you already you have an integrity
to do honor to your subject.

1883
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:53,140
So to do honor to your subject,
you learn it perfectly.

1884
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:53,875
Yeah.

1885
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:58,779
But you can also know that there are
stories around you learn the rigor,

1886
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:03,150
but you can also how you learn
the rigor could be creative.

1887
01:32:04,085 --> 01:32:07,622
And it doesn't have to be through
a very rote memorization, right?

1888
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,591
A category as an object
where if you learn it

1889
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:14,462
in a very beautiful way,
then I'm also going to honor that.

1890
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,497
So that's what I mean
by like a creative setting.

1891
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:19,934
I don't ever go, Oh yeah, here's
this like diamond thing and that's it.

1892
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:24,071
No, it's actually very specific
but it's according to who

1893
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:27,341
I'm talking to,
if it's like super, you know,

1894
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:29,310
mathematicians are already

1895
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:29,777
this level,

1896
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:33,981
then I just start with that right if
I'm introducing it to undergrads, right?

1897
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:38,352
I will start with an intuitive
and intuitive kind of,

1898
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,690
I don't know, derivative of the thing and
then actually introduce them into that

1899
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,825
because I want them to retain it.

1900
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,260
I don't want them to shut down.

1901
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,230
I don't want to invoke
their cortisol system.

1902
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:49,630
Right?

1903
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:53,601
So I'm really an advocate
for like metacognitive techniques.

1904
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:56,637
So once I, I'm getting

1905
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:59,574
a really good feel
about how people learn.

1906
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:03,778
And so the minute you know how you think
somebody like me is super abstract

1907
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:07,782
for me, the intersection of something
and I'll get it right, the way that you

1908
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:11,919
balance rigor and creativity is to know
who the actual learner is yeah.

1909
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:13,120
So who they are.

1910
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,957
And it's almost like, I guess I would say
my pedagogy is like a harp

1911
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:18,993
and I'm tuning a harp
because I myself am a harp.

1912
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:23,764
So the way that you're going to actually
balance the rigor and the creativity

1913
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:29,437
is for your own self to be harp like
so that I can tune to the actual student.

1914
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,739
Oh, they're more of a creative.
I'll try it like this.

1915
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:32,773
Oh, they're more of an engineer.

1916
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,575
Well, I'll try and engineering.

1917
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:36,243
I'll try a system way, right?

1918
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:40,081
I just explain diamonds
to like a bunch of computer

1919
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,984
science people
and I turned it into data structures.

1920
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:46,554
So if I can align it with something
that they already know, for me,

1921
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:49,657
I think that learning
is about having constellations

1922
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:52,460
in your head
how many constellations do you have?

1923
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:55,262
Can you actually link
everything together?

1924
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,133
And so if I'm, if there's too much
like rigor

1925
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,770
without you know,
without a creative setting,

1926
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:07,642
I think I have, I will fail the people
that don't have the constellations yet.

1927
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,677
A bunch of experts.
I could do that as well.

1928
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,846
But, you know, I also

1929
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,982
nobody knows
nobody knows the consciousness realm.

1930
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:17,318
Nobody knows what this actually is.

1931
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:21,288
And at least I'm open to saying that if
every theorem I come up with in my it's

1932
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:21,956
just a theorem.

1933
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:23,557
Some people think
they're absolutely right.

1934
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:26,127
And I really don't agree with that
at all.

1935
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:29,964
We have rough ideas
of what it means to do this and this,

1936
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,132
but that's why I'm asking, like,

1937
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:34,969
what actually
are the fundamental units of life?

1938
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:35,736
You know, you can tell me

1939
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:39,540
when the interface breaks,
but you can't tell me about awareness.

1940
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,178
And like if I asked a neuropsych, like,
why can I not split the consciousness?

1941
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:44,478
Right?

1942
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,013
They would say, Well, you know,

1943
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:46,847
I don't know

1944
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:50,184
because I'm not talking about like talk
about partitioning the brain.

1945
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,285
And you just have like two.

1946
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:55,189
It's like, like you would say like
a split screen, like those old movies.

1947
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,724
I'm not talking about that. Right?

1948
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:59,960
I'm actually talking
about double experience. It's

1949
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:03,798
double experience, triple experience,
but not just sensory, you know?

1950
01:35:04,231 --> 01:35:08,135
So I think I think the way that
you balance the rigor with the creativity

1951
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:11,906
is to also have integrity
with yourself, integrity to the subject.

1952
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:13,474
Anyone who

1953
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:16,577
actually wants to learn
it wants to learn the specificities.

1954
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:17,144
Right?

1955
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:19,980
But what's
what if you don't have creativity,

1956
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:22,550
you'll never be able
to go anywhere with the rigor I give you.

1957
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:25,319
If you're just rigorous,
you're just going to be there.

1958
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:28,489
But if I can instill in you creativity
and you're actually going to be able

1959
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:31,125
to take the rigor and link it
and intersect it.

1960
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:34,729
And again,
if so, it's all about like why you saying

1961
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:37,164
your phenomenological like state?

1962
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:39,200
I think we're here to create new things.

1963
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,035
I think being is creation.

1964
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:45,773
So if I can give you rigor, but
it can also hold your imaginary space,

1965
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,142
then you'll be able to take that idea
like nobody else

1966
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:50,911
that me would take diamonds and find
the consciousness, you know what I mean?

1967
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:52,012
Right.

1968
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:54,949
So we're getting close
to close to the end of the hour.

1969
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:57,284
But as I mentioned,

1970
01:35:58,385 --> 01:35:59,153
I'm kind of curious

1971
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:02,223
about, but what what started you in math?

1972
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,625
Like, like how old you were?

1973
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:05,593
Totally young.

1974
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:10,931
Well, I was like, Hmm, you know, I,
I was like, what is this thing?

1975
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:11,599
You know what I mean?

1976
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,168
I would stare at mirrors, and I'm like,
that's really interesting.

1977
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:15,269
And then

1978
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:18,606
I was basically asking my parents, like,
why am I not falling through the floor?

1979
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:19,240
You know,

1980
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,343
because I, I got pretty early on that
all this stuff

1981
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,812
sort of looked like it was made
out of the same thing.

1982
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:27,381
And I'm like, why are they, like,
why am I not falling through the floor?

1983
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:29,350
Like, what is holding all this together?

1984
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:33,854
It's also very, very curious
as to why I woke up in the same thing.

1985
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:35,790
I was like,
Why am I not a lobster tomorrow?

1986
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:39,560
So there was some kind of stability here
that I was very perplexed by.

1987
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,096
I'm also an avid reader,
and when you read,

1988
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:45,032
there was like a voice in your head
reading. And I was like, Who's that

1989
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:46,834
who is that?

1990
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,303
When people are talking to themselves,
who is that?

1991
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:54,508
You know, I was also highly aware that
when you're sleeping, who was asleep?

1992
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:55,442
Nobody was asleep.

1993
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:58,012
If I was up remembering dreams
and things like this.

1994
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:00,714
So it's very vivid.

1995
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:04,385
I would have lots of connections
with like animals and,

1996
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:08,289
you know, not like body sport,
but it was super, super empathic.

1997
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,391
And I would visit, you know,

1998
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:12,726
kind of divine places and they're like,
oh, this is exciting.

1999
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:16,096
And so what I found is that you
know, avid reader,

2000
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:18,933
so already had the literary space,
but I was like, What are these?

2001
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,302
I always thought
that there was something else.

2002
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:23,671
And so what I love about math, right?

2003
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,739
Is that it was it was

2004
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:27,408
this beautiful

2005
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:31,345
language and a gift
that allowed me to actually think about

2006
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:35,249
higher worlds,
you know, in a in a structured way.

2007
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:38,552
And so I was like,
oh, well, this is an actual language.

2008
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,055
And I thought that
there was something universal about it.

2009
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:42,056
Right.

2010
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:44,491
But there's not a lot of dialects
for math.

2011
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:47,628
You know, and it made it really simple,
like, oh, you know, category theory.

2012
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:48,729
Hey, I do, too.

2013
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,131
Versus like,
I was teaching myself Mandarin and mine.

2014
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:54,735
You know, I still have this California
kind of accent thing right?

2015
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:56,036
It didn't work so well.

2016
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:59,006
And so the dialects
can actually hurt language, but

2017
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,176
mass seemed to be this, like,
universal way.

2018
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:05,379
And I was like, oh, hey, maybe
we can all figure out what this thing is.

2019
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,480
Again, math is not

2020
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,984
it's like my version of math, you can see
is very philosophical, right?

2021
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:12,586
So it's like also
my favorite writer was like,

2022
01:38:12,586 --> 01:38:15,656
you know, Alice in Wonderland and
I'm like, oh, through the looking glass.

2023
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:17,858
Like, that's cool. And at the end, he's
doing all the syllogisms.

2024
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:20,895
And I thought, hey, if you take, like,
no, awesome.

2025
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,430
Like, oh, syllogisms,
I can just mess around with that

2026
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,534
and I've just messed with causality,
you know, paradox and things like that.

2027
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:31,705
So super avid reader getting my hands
on big philosophy, very young and also

2028
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:37,144
staying open so to like to what
is because I could tell that time wasn't

2029
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:41,081
linear and I was like, I need a subject
and I can actually figure all this out.

2030
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,450
Like time. It's not linear. Like,
how can I do that?

2031
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:47,187
And I know topology and special spaces
and stuff like, oh, it looks like that.

2032
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:47,521
Yeah.

2033
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:51,825
I would say
it made my synesthete like comfortable.

2034
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:53,060
You know what I mean?

2035
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,261
Yeah.

2036
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:55,095
Yeah,

2037
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,231
cool. Well,

2038
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:00,668
I don't think I have anything else.

2039
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:04,138
And we're getting curves
and so what do you think?

2040
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:07,975
I would be remiss not to ask
how you thought

2041
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:11,412
active inference plays into this or what
you thought about active inference.

2042
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:14,348
Yeah. How about like that's
what you're saying, right?

2043
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:17,351
How the interface is actually intersect
or just.

2044
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:17,651
Right?

2045
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:21,588
What, what comes to mind when you think
about active inference and cybernetics?

2046
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:22,923
And control theory

2047
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:25,859
and where some of this, like agent
in the niche goes from,

2048
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:29,196
there's the analytical,
there's the philosophical, and then

2049
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:33,701
not getting into the theology
of what's real, but just like

2050
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:37,171
there's the agents, the model about how
the agent is operating in the niche.

2051
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,707
So where is what is active inference?

2052
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:43,644
Yeah, well, I guess from like,
you know, the way that you've defined it.

2053
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:46,246
So again, I'm interested into, OK,
so here's like

2054
01:39:47,081 --> 01:39:48,716
I guess my, my knowledge of it, right?

2055
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:52,553
So here's an agent with
I mean, I guess, right?

2056
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:56,457
With a certain interface,
I quote, interact with you like whatever

2057
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:57,424
that means.

2058
01:39:57,424 --> 01:40:01,095
And so in my opinion, the way that things
are interacting is through

2059
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:03,464
how many Morph isms
they actually generate.

2060
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:05,466
So it's actually categorical.

2061
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:08,702
So I don't do this
sort of like analytical, like philosophy,

2062
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:11,672
philosophical, because again,
I'm from this higher space.

2063
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:15,342
So if you just if you look at active
inference, maybe through category theory,

2064
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,413
now what's really happening,
it's like, oh, oh, interesting at

2065
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,482
what at what instant does

2066
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:24,785
my interaction with this
like opposite agent or whatever

2067
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:29,189
throw me into a reflective subcategory
where I'm actually just interacting

2068
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:30,391
with myself.

2069
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:35,462
So I'm really interested in where
the interface theory can actually

2070
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:38,432
meet topological localization
like I was talking about.

2071
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:39,566
So I think

2072
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,236
see, what I like about this is that it
sounds like

2073
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:45,172
you're doing the same thing that I'm
doing with much different language.

2074
01:40:45,472 --> 01:40:47,408
So topological localization, right?

2075
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:50,444
I'm interested in
how do you find the inverses and relate

2076
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:53,547
more and make my space stronger

2077
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,816
by passing
through these reflective subcategories.

2078
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,751
And so if it's like, oh,

2079
01:40:57,751 --> 01:41:00,487
if the active inference is
how these agents are swapping

2080
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:03,690
and actually interacting
because that's very curious.

2081
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:08,662
It's very curious how what I'm taking
your information into my data structure

2082
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:12,332
and I don't know like what
receiving looks like on that end.

2083
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:16,203
So I would just say that categorically,
it sounds like we're doing the same thing

2084
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:21,875
and then it gets pretty meta for me
when I'm sort of like I take your info

2085
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,078
and then it becomes part of my system

2086
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:26,346
and it's part of my own reflective
subcategory.

2087
01:41:26,346 --> 01:41:27,181
And I. Like, I don't.

2088
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:29,416
Know, like keep moving on or something.

2089
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,020
But if it's about,
if it's about how interfaces work,

2090
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:36,990
I still don't know how you got
the original interface. So

2091
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,027
I don't know if that or anything.

2092
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:40,727
You know.

2093
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:45,032
Some of these ideas
we talked a little bit about in

2094
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:50,938
active inference, 17 to 0.1 and two
because that was the paper

2095
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:53,774
that we focused on for those weeks
by Fields and Glazebrook.

2096
01:41:54,174 --> 01:41:57,044
But I think what you have pointed to
today really also

2097
01:41:57,044 --> 01:41:59,780
gives us a lot of things to go over again
and think about.

2098
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:05,319
So maybe we can stay in touch
and if you ever want to join

2099
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:09,256
for another conversation or participate
in any other way, it'd be awesome

2100
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:11,959
because it's really thought provoking
and I hope our lab enjoys it.

2101
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,061
Yeah, so fun.

2102
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:15,462
Thank you so much. I had a great time.

2103
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:17,131
Thank you. Whoops.

2104
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:31,845
Bye. And.
