1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:06,960
hello

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,599
welcome to the active inference lab this

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,200
is math stream

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
1.1 our first math stream

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
and we're really lucky today to be able

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
to have some time with

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
shanna dobson and we're going to be

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,279
talking about emergent time and

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,480
chromatic types

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
and hear a lot more on this topic and

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,880
also check in with everyone's questions

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
that are in the live chat or in the

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,359
comments later

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,279
but first we'll just quickly introduce

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
ourselves and then hear a presentation

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
and then have a discussion

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
so again i'm daniel and i'm here with my

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
co-organizer sarah so maybe sarah say hi

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,360
and then pass it off

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
uh hey um sarah calling in from walk

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
down forever berlin germany

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,680
and um i'm looking forward to

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
talking to shayna dobson

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,960
hey sarah thank you thank you for a nice

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
intro hello everyone my name is shanna

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
and uh i am uh i'll be a graduate

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
student in the fall but i've studied a

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
whole bunch of stuff

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,320
in the middle um i'm kind of a i guess a

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
polymath that

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
got a bunch of degrees at once and um

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
did a masters and i'm a i was hired

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
right away as a full-time lecturer kind

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,119
of everywhere

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,439
and um found a couple topics that i'm

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,320
pretty interested in

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,680
so let's see if uh if this can be

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
exciting for someone

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,199
shayna dobson sorry

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
okay daniel can you see this okay yep

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
all right am i ready to go okay good

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
um great all right so i want to talk

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,560
about

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
um emergent time and chromatic types and

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
you know maybe um i mean it's up to

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
y'all if you want to ask me questions as

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
i go or maybe hold them because i'm

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,320
trying to

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,479
constellate uh what's going on here

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,520
you're gonna see there's some heavy

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
topics involved

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,759
but i try to make them um as beautiful

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
and palatable as i can

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
so uh let's just get right to it what

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
are these and what am i talking about

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,639
so i have a few questions um kind of

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,919
driving this independent of the

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
mathematics i'm trying to make this not

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
super math focused i was trying to make

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
this kind of

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
more applicable to everyone because the

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
math that i do is super niche

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,879
and i was trying to not do that and be

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
like a non-inclusive

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,959
so the big questions the philosophy

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
questions that are driving me is what

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
is time um is there anything that isn't

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,080
time

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
time is always modeled as either just

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
like a geiger counter or it's

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
this sort of accepted background

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
phenomena and i don't really agree with

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
that i feel like we haven't

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,640
focused too much on it people think like

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,519
where is it

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
you know i ask like uh sometimes i give

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
talks and my uh my first uh question is

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
like where is yesterday and of course

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
people like what you know you could zoom

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
out and look at like the light you know

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
the light cone data and things like that

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
but it's like phenomenologically really

83
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,879
interesting where is it

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
and you know uh will it always be here

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
and i remember i was talking to rafael

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,920
bouzou and

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
he's got this great paper about like you

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
know i mean is it will it always be here

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,159
and

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,200
maybe it's not um maybe it it sort of

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,920
just maybe

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,239
you know it came at some point as well

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
hence i think it's sort of

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
emergent so and i like wasn't always

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,640
here and

96
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
here's probably not the appropriate word

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
you're going to see that i love language

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
so again i'm super poly math and i

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
a lot of my math papers are super math

100
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
philosophy

101
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
and so i think there's a lot of

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
problematic terms

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
that we need to actually go into and so

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
i actually say where's non-archimedean

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,560
time

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,360
you know so um not an archimedean the

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
you know the

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,319
uh to be archimedean is to believe in

109
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
infinite decimals that you can always

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,239
have a number bigger or lower and

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,599
in quantum mechanics you really have a

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
cut off right so if quantum mechanics is

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,120
modeling

114
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
you know cut-offs as um you know spatial

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
cut-outs as

116
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
non-archimedean why is time not also

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
non-archimedean so i'm very interested

118
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,599
in that

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
what would that actually look like let

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
me go heavy into that so

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
um you know sarah i had the iliyah

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
that's derrida

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
in the french continental philosophy

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
saying that there's always a there is

125
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,480
in mathematics we always go there exists

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,519
you know there exists an

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
x such that whatever and so that's very

128
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
powerful the existential quantifier

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,560
right

130
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
but and qualifier but i'm you know what

131
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,800
are the conditions for existence

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
this is something chris fields and i are

133
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
working on like you what are those

134
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,320
not just like metabolic conditions i

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
mean all of this

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
you know so i think the big bang is a

137
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
real problem

138
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
and uh like going into that of course

139
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
you have all these wild theories about

140
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
you know well you know it's like a a

141
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
white you know like a white hole that

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
passed through something else and all

143
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,960
this kind of stuff

144
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
but i'm really interested in like what

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,919
are the conditions to even have

146
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,800
existence

147
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
right so uh what what would the

148
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,639
conditions be to have a discretization

149
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,440
of time

150
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
what does that even mean so what is

151
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,000
entropy and a temporal discretization so

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
we have this like very vague notion of

153
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
entropy and i agree with uh like max

154
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
tegmark that there is no objective

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
notion of entropy you're like oh

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
well there's a local you know influx of

157
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
energy here but

158
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
you know uh the environment surrounding

159
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
it lost energy so there seems to be a

160
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
calibration there you know

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
so my whole point is to uh categorify

162
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
the stop mechanism just like chris

163
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
talked about in his last talk

164
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
um you know biologically speaking like

165
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
when to stop

166
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,479
uh like you know cellularly dividing the

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
the stop mechanism

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
on the bio level is very very very

169
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
intricate in my opinion

170
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
and so i'm wondering like how would you

171
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
categorify that i mean like using

172
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,639
category theory

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,120
uh so i'm my whole vibe here is to try

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,880
to actually upgrade the mathematics

175
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
that's used

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
in modeling some of these things again

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
my head is pretty abstract

178
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
so i see things abstractly but i think

179
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,360
it's a gift because it's allowing me to

180
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
see connections

181
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
in a non-linear way so my brain is

182
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
definitely non-linear and i try to use

183
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,240
that in linear

184
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
phenomena so i say you know how can we

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
say you know there exists a time

186
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,199
asymmetry but it uses this

187
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
like phrase well when there is no

188
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
objective notion of entropy

189
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
i think it's really really tricky

190
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
there's also no proven structural

191
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
causality

192
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
all right and sarah you had this you

193
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,479
know the light cone it's a little vague

194
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
right there's some problems uh with gr

195
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
there's some problems with the

196
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
formulation of light cone and things

197
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,080
like that

198
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
um light cones wouldn't withstand

199
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
quantum mechanics and stuff like this so

200
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,319
um i

201
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,680
firmly believe you know just like

202
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
bertrand russell that there is no

203
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
structural causality and it leads you

204
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
into these great things like

205
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
last thursday-ism and you know the world

206
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,759
was made five minutes ago

207
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
and there's really no logical

208
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
impossibility in saying that

209
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
so i have not seen a structural

210
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,160
causality

211
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
and so again chris fields and i agree

212
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
with this and that's why we're writing

213
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
this cool stuff

214
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
number eight why do we actually

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
experience memories this is actually um

216
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
like why a lot of this is very um

217
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
again taken for granted and so i'm

218
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,240
really interested in

219
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
like why that is of course people say

220
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
you have memories to prevent you from

221
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,520
you know falling off a cliff again

222
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
like association and base pavlovian

223
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
uh you know survival and that's not what

224
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
i'm talking about right

225
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,599
i'm actually talking about re like how

226
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
why do you experience

227
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
them somebody like me like a total

228
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
precog like i remember everything

229
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
and sometimes i can get you know haunted

230
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
by thoughts like memories that just come

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
come in and i um i know there's a lot of

232
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
people like that maybe you're just

233
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,639
taking a test

234
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
and these horrible memories just fly in

235
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
your head or maybe they're really good

236
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
memories right

237
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
but the experience of that is very

238
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
strange nobody knows what a thought is

239
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
right i remember sarah i think you asked

240
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,120
in ser and chris's talk

241
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
you know what what is a thought and i've

242
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
i haven't heard anything about what

243
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
those are people oh quantum fluctuations

244
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
and things like this yeah but

245
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
there's something else going on because

246
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
you know for instance like

247
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
the speech that i just said i read

248
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,680
number eight

249
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
like two minutes ago and uh so the

250
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
speech is gone right it dies but

251
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
something remains

252
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,400
and so uh what is that it seems like

253
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
there's a hologram

254
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
copy of everything that you say that's

255
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
actually stored in the brain

256
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,319
and you're doing some kind of recall

257
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,639
with that but i don't understand storage

258
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
if everything is discrete

259
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
and so that's why this is very complex

260
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
and very beautiful so i say what

261
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
what are they like what is the

262
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
fundamental unit of thought you know

263
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
alan watts is going to say so oh it's

264
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,599
like existence and i'm not really sure

265
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,440
what the bio people are going to say

266
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
what is it you know um what is not a

267
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,479
thought

268
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,680
you know so for me you're going to see

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
that i'm going to invoke this pro finite

270
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
condition a pro finite set

271
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,719
is a um a compact totally disconnected

272
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,919
space it's so it's

273
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
it's like a canter set so i think that

274
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,000
what's happening is time is like a

275
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
canter set

276
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,599
and somehow you are recalling over a

277
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,479
cantor set

278
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
what is a thought that no idea right um

279
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,519
no idea how we're even speaking to each

280
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
other so i think we actually need to go

281
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
over what that is these are just the

282
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
questions having begun the talk right

283
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
so questions two right what is causality

284
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
like what is it again if i don't believe

285
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
in structure you know oh a came before

286
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,839
b that's very reference frame dependent

287
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,800
and reference frames

288
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
are flimsy right and so i say well

289
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,959
causality for him

290
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,000
and then i say well what is a

291
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
measurement that's very tricky right of

292
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
course the quantum problem

293
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
and um just measurement in general yeah

294
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
and i say well what is a reference frame

295
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
that's even worse

296
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
um you know according to me my world

297
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,279
according to me

298
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
and like who is me and so that's going

299
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
to be tricky

300
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,880
so chris and i you know both agree like

301
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
what is this personal identity

302
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
over time and you've got big branches of

303
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
philosophy like pedurantism and

304
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,760
endurances i'm trying to just

305
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
trying to figure out what that is right

306
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
uh

307
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
who is this right uh is

308
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
is me today the same as me yesterday

309
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,279
well clearly not

310
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,720
because the cells are doing a whole

311
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
bunch of things right we don't have any

312
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
of the same cells that we used to have i

313
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
mean maybe some neuronal things

314
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
but um you know you have a boundary and

315
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
so what's happened so i you know i don't

316
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
understand what over time means i don't

317
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
know how anyone can be over anything

318
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
so then you know um sarah i said well

319
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
isn't you know uh shouldn't you talk

320
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
about space time and i'm like that's

321
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,399
just a manifold it's like one of the

322
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
most basic structures in mathematics and

323
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
we have more sophisticated mathematics

324
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
so i don't really vibe with uh

325
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,720
the manifold thought i think you can

326
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
really

327
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,760
really sparkle and dazzle that up to see

328
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,959
what's actually happening

329
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,000
i don't know if you actually have to

330
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
unify them like that you know um

331
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
you could just be spatializing time

332
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
instead of leaving time as it is

333
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
so then i'm like okay if you want to

334
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
just use like uh manifold and

335
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,880
differential geometry you could also go

336
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,839
number theory

337
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
so like what would a number theoretic

338
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
time look like and what would like a

339
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
number theoretic space look like

340
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
so you don't have to just like my whole

341
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
point is that

342
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
physics like the the framing of physics

343
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
is based on the mathematics at the

344
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
current time

345
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
so a lot of quantum mechanics is like

346
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
linear algebra and operator theory but

347
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
you could also

348
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
up that and make it like algebraic

349
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
number theory and then you'd get new

350
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,839
physics so with me

351
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,839
if you give new math you get new physics

352
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,959
so upgrade the maths

353
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
you know so like what is a number

354
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
theoretic black hole that sounds a lot

355
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,279
cooler to me than

356
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
the you know the the framing of the

357
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,519
black hole the old model has a lot of

358
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,560
problems

359
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
can you also like see me okay yep okay

360
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,000
cool

361
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
all right so let's go through this

362
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
outline and again i'll just keep the

363
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,200
talk

364
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,640
um at like an hour and then um

365
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
all right so here we go so those are my

366
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,079
like big questions kind of funneling

367
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:18,959
everything

368
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
um so i'll talk about discrete time i'm

369
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
going to really firmly say that there is

370
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
no synchronous reference that everything

371
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
that's happening now already happened

372
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
you do have like a lot of time in the

373
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,640
brain

374
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
to process so there is nobody's

375
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
experiencing anything as it is

376
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
and things like that i'm also going to

377
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
say that there really is no self

378
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
reflexivity because i

379
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
i don't know if that there's a self and

380
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,560
so

381
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,920
chris and i are trying to actually

382
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
formulate all this together right so i

383
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
really don't think there is a productism

384
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
or an endurantism with those two

385
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
philosophies that are trying to say

386
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
you know that you exist as a

387
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
four-dimensional being and you kind of

388
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,120
exist

389
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
through time and i think there's some

390
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,240
problems with that

391
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
so problems within produrantism or

392
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
endurance is like oh i get cut and i

393
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
have a reaction later

394
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
those those pieces of you were supposed

395
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
to be independent but they're not

396
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
we're in touch with our pain but they

397
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
would say that it's like not

398
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
so it's it's a little tricky um i think

399
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
there is no personal identity over time

400
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,399
i have no idea how this is happening

401
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,240
there's like a reset happening

402
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
every every um every whatever you

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
may not want to say plank time but if

404
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
there's not personal identity over time

405
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
there's definitely you know so i think

406
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
uh the memory whatever it is has a

407
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,240
singular support

408
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,839
the support is the um the um

409
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
the the you know places where a function

410
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
is

411
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
not zero so if you only have singular

412
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
support then that means you're not zero

413
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,480
on a singular set

414
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
so it's actually uh again i'm i'm trying

415
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
to upgrade the mathematics used in all

416
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
of this to

417
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
fractals and cantor sets things like

418
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,399
that i'll introduce chromatic types and

419
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
chromatic types is going to be this new

420
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
spin that i'm working on um

421
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
that's sort of paralleling what's called

422
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,560
a homotopy type

423
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,320
a new holographic principle based on

424
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
these diamonds uh that i really like

425
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,240
and emergent time okay so for the why

426
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
how and to what extent that i was asked

427
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
to kind of fill out i said why because

428
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
this day there does not exist a coherent

429
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
formalism of emergent time nor

430
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
discretization of time

431
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
imagine there is no continuum right

432
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
that's a huge uh it's a huge statement

433
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
what exists actually between the

434
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
discretization what is emergence

435
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
how can we again our complexity class

436
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
complexity class in the sense of turing

437
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
degrees that's what i'm referring to

438
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
so not equivalence classes sarah but

439
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
like the turing degree equivalent

440
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
that you still have this like there is

441
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
and that's the

442
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
physics of time equivalent of a

443
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
meaningful president but it's absent of

444
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
all kazoo stream because industry is

445
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
like a softest tree we have a

446
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
we have lots of physics sophistry and

447
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
mathematical sophistry and i'm like can

448
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,399
we actually

449
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,800
try to figure out how we can actually uh

450
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,440
have

451
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,240
existence with this uh discretization of

452
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
time

453
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
independent of any kind of conniving you

454
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
know so how well we're gonna you know

455
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
hopefully have a wondrous introduction

456
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
discretization mathematically all that

457
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
is uh commissioner with it okay

458
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
so um i'm into a lot of uh

459
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,519
mathematics um where you can construct

460
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,320
spaces

461
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
based on algebraic spaces so

462
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,880
i'm going to try to go really lightly

463
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
through this because this is pretty

464
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
heavy

465
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
but um so you can quotient out a scheme

466
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
which is like a higher dimensional

467
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
notion of an algebraic variety

468
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,000
by a pro-ital equivalence relation pro

469
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
tells us

470
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,399
a certain topology an equivalence

471
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
relation is going to be a gluing

472
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
so you get this diamond which is a sheaf

473
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,519
on a category

474
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
in a category called perfectoid spaces

475
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,160
so this diamond has these quote

476
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
impurities which are these geometric

477
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
points i refer to

478
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
so this is a notion from peter schulza

479
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
and i

480
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
really like the the diamond idea and um

481
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,839
so what happens that you have this uh

482
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
this geometric point which is a morphism

483
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,880
of schemes

484
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
and it's almost like um so it's it's

485
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
sort of like this that there are

486
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
mathematical impurities in this object

487
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
and so

488
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,639
when you have a normal diamond uh you

489
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,720
have you know different colors on it

490
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,959
that are reflections of the impurities

491
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,160
but you don't ever actually see the

492
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,199
impurity itself

493
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,839
you just see the reflections of the

494
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,199
impurities and so you're never

495
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,959
actually getting the thing you're

496
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
actually only getting shifted

497
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,800
versions of a reflection that's what i

498
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
think is going on here

499
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
right so you have your uh you know your

500
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,360
interface

501
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
and no one's ever actually experiencing

502
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
the thing just a profiling many copies

503
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,160
so

504
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
you could you can pull this morphism of

505
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
a scheme back which is a topological

506
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,720
move

507
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
and you can get this what's called a

508
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
profanity many copies of spa

509
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
see this is the attic spectrum of an

510
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
algebraically closed

511
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
curve so you can make these products spa

512
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,959
c cross

513
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,120
s underline for s underline being a pro

514
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,199
finite set which i described earlier

515
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
so you can get these awesome products

516
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
and um this is

517
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,079
this is the new like model that i use to

518
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,680
uh write um this cool paper with my

519
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
awesome colleague robert pretner

520
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
about a new model of consciousness where

521
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
it's like okay

522
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
this is what's going on you know you

523
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,360
have profiling many copies of this of

524
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
a perception it's you're not really

525
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,639
perceiving

526
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,480
so um but that that's pretty deep that's

527
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
the some of the hardest math on the

528
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
planet it's like looking at sheaves

529
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,920
on um a category so discretized time

530
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,360
right so something i came up with just a

531
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,399
bit ago was like there you know there

532
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,199
really is no

533
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
you can't really say a equals b whatever

534
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,399
you want to say that

535
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,720
really what you're saying is a equals b

536
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,759
up to some condition

537
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,639
x where x is what is called a homotopy

538
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,360
type

539
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
so type theory is like uh pretty rampant

540
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,560
in the

541
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,759
in like um lots of like awesome models

542
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,240
and so a homotopic type is going to be

543
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
like it's an equivalence

544
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
it's an equivalence um based on

545
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
homotopies which are deformations

546
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,079
between two spaces so you can say a is

547
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,839
equivalent to b if criterion x

548
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
is considered so you have to be really

549
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
careful with the statement equals

550
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
yeah and so really we really only have

551
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
intersubjective agreement on certain

552
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
metrics so i really think there is no

553
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
equality for anything

554
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,280
you just have a bunch of agents agreeing

555
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
on these metrics right um

556
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
the brilliant don hoffman has a bunch of

557
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
work on that too and um

558
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
i was working in his uh research group

559
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,919
for a bit so you know i think that

560
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,240
mentation these biological processes i

561
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,199
just give a

562
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
um a talk on like mentation and

563
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
a certain homotopy type um that it

564
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,000
actually works in discrete time so how

565
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
are you actually going to do that

566
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
how can you actually model memory and

567
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,960
biological functions

568
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
over a discretized time that looks like

569
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
a bunch of dots so that looks like

570
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
memory of a singular support and you're

571
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
going to have to

572
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
really figure out how you could get

573
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
words and things like that

574
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
so what i'm going to do is like

575
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
introduce those chromatic types

576
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
so again there's no personal identity

577
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
over time i think you only have

578
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
chromatic towers of localization i'll go

579
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
over that

580
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
but in your singular support you're

581
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,679
doing what's called a localization

582
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
localization is a way of adding

583
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,919
inverses um you know for instance the

584
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
integers right

585
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
if you want to add like inverses to the

586
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
integers you need to get something like

587
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
the rational numbers

588
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
so to add inverses is a way of making a

589
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,679
space more

590
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
full i'll say and then also you can take

591
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
categories

592
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
which have morphisms and you can make

593
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
the morphisms isomorphism which means

594
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
they're invertible

595
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
so localization's pretty powerful so

596
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,000
again there really is no personal

597
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
identity uh you know there's only

598
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,320
personal identity

599
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,559
up to time i also think i don't know

600
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,640
time may be just the up to condition for

601
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,679
you to exist

602
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
you are in essence localizing at each

603
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
point of the singular supports

604
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
and i think i wrote yeah i've wrote a

605
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,799
little paper about this that should be

606
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,000
out in the journal

607
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
cognitive science so hopefully it's

608
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
there so what is this

609
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
so homotopy type is a topological space

610
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
regarded up to weak

611
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,880
homotopia equivalence um uh what okay

612
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,039
so it's a topological space regarded up

613
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,160
to um you know

614
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
uh how you know um how you can actually

615
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
equate various objects in the space and

616
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
what's called an infinity groupoid um

617
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,000
you know you can get an

618
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
infinity groupoid where all the

619
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,200
morphisms are actually

620
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
so all the maps are actually invertible

621
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
so we call a weak homotopia equivalents

622
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
a map between topological spaces which

623
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,840
induces

624
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
isomorphisms on all the homotopic groups

625
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
the homotropic groups are encoding

626
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,080
um the homotopy behavior and so

627
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
say that's in that book that i

628
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
recommended to you

629
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
so groups so we're familiar with groups

630
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
you know that you know where symmetries

631
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,799
relate an object to itself

632
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,120
and but a group void you have symmetries

633
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
acting between more than one object as

634
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
you can see in this like

635
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
this visual so i've got a b c d these

636
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
are multiple objects and you have maps

637
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
going everywhere

638
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,720
so um a groupoid is a category where all

639
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
the morphisms are isomorphisms

640
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,559
so if i have an infinity groupoid it

641
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,400
means i have an infin infinite

642
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,360
morphisms so infinite isomorphisms so

643
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
the big idea for the chromatic type is

644
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
to actually put a chromatic tower

645
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,679
over a temporal logic we're all familiar

646
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,679
with temporal logic

647
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,720
and you're going to see what i mean by

648
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
this tower so i think you can actually

649
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,120
create

650
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,400
chromatic types instead of a homotopy

651
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
type

652
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,919
so we're going to be interested in

653
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,159
creating these chromatic spaces

654
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
that have their own notion of

655
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,919
localization

656
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,120
and then you can get a new idea of time

657
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,679
so localizing a geometric homotopic so

658
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,280
again i told you localization is a way

659
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,760
of adding

660
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,720
inverses in category theory that means

661
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
you want to make your maps

662
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
isomorphisms so we say given a category

663
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
c in a class w of morphisms we seek the

664
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,760
localization

665
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,840
c w inverse you can get a reflective

666
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,000
localization

667
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
what you do is you localize which means

668
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
add inverses you complete the space

669
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
what if that's a koshi space like if you

670
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
want to get sequences to converge

671
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
and then you take the inverse limit

672
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
which is gluing you're going to see i do

673
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
a lot of gluing

674
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
so for a category a category is a

675
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
collection of objects and morphisms and

676
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,000
you have an associativity condition and

677
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
an identity arrow

678
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
so homotopies again are maps ways to get

679
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
ways to get objects to be equivalents

680
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
and there's all kinds of ways that you

681
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,919
can do that so i'm interested in

682
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,120
something called topological

683
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
localization so this is another

684
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,440
type of topic localization so we say a

685
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
topological localization is a left exact

686
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
localization and again i'm going to go

687
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
very gentle with some of these

688
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
definitions

689
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
left exact localization of an infinity

690
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
one category so that's a category of

691
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,320
infinite morphisms um in the sense of

692
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,159
passing to what's called a reflective

693
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,760
sub infinity one category at a

694
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,919
collection of morphisms that are

695
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,480
monomorphisms

696
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
so um with the details are

697
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,080
of course they're important but for uh

698
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
the the whole point is that you have a

699
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,640
reflective

700
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
subcategory what's that reflective

701
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,600
subcategory it's a full subcategory

702
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
such that the objects d and the

703
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,520
morphisms have reflections

704
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
in the category so that's very cool so

705
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
the objects and the morphisms

706
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
have reflections every object in d looks

707
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
at its own reflection by a certain

708
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,240
morphism t

709
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
d to td and the reflection of an object

710
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,919
c and c is actually equipped with an

711
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
isomorphism

712
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
so that's great the inclusion creates

713
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,039
all limits and it has all cool limits

714
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,320
which de-admits so

715
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
the to say that you have limits and

716
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,559
co-limits means that your category is

717
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,280
sort of a

718
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
very very nicely well behaved so this is

719
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,280
very neat

720
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,679
that in the reflective subcategory it

721
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,880
seems very apropos

722
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
to pair that with the diamond work that

723
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
i'm trying to do because

724
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,159
uh the diamond is dealing with

725
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,600
profinetly made copies of these

726
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
reflections

727
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,080
and the reflective subcategory you know

728
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,280
contains

729
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
uh reflections of the actual object so

730
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
it's a very very special

731
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,520
um subcategory

732
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,799
so again the whole idea is to get okay

733
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,960
so maybe at every moment you are

734
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
actually topologically

735
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
localizing and so that actually means

736
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,520
you're actually just looking at your own

737
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,120
reflections all the time which you

738
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,520
are right there's a lot of maxims that

739
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
say you know you see what you

740
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
are absolutely so um i'd still you know

741
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,400
so

742
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
i'm using all of that beautiful

743
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
mathematics to actually justify a

744
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,880
statement

745
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
that you know would only like without

746
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
the mathematics the statement would just

747
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
be like

748
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
a sentence and i can actually try to

749
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
justify it structurally

750
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
so i think you're actually localizing

751
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,240
time as these kinds of equivalences

752
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
so there really is no well-defined

753
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
notion of metric you really just have

754
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
uh you know why why are we working in

755
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
topological spaces because the metrics

756
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
are very subjective

757
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,080
and so you work topologically or you

758
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
don't really have a notion of metric but

759
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
you have a closeness condition

760
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
so everyone works topologically and i'm

761
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
trying to categorify the notion of time

762
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
and space means to throw it into

763
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
category theory

764
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
let's talk about its morphisms and how

765
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,080
you localize it

766
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,240
and how you invert the morphisms so you

767
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
need to ask

768
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
huh you know so topological spaces you

769
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
have a topology on a space

770
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
so here right with the like the diamond

771
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,960
i put it you know like um

772
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
you know peter puts a sheath on a you

773
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
know in a category like okay

774
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
so what are open sets in a category

775
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
that's actually not trivial

776
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,440
right like um so you know i say the

777
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
construction of the topological

778
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
localization seems appropriately meta

779
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
in its construction of a reflection of

780
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,120
what is already profinitely many copies

781
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,039
i say the word v stack it's a higher

782
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,400
notion of a diamond

783
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,720
and i'll go into that a little bit later

784
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,000
so the the second meta

785
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,919
question is how would you actually put a

786
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,919
topology like on an infinity one

787
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,120
category

788
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
that's hard right you have to actually

789
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
figure out what the open sets are

790
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,120
in a category right and so uh basic

791
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
point set topology and like anything in

792
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
hatcher is going to go over

793
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
you know topological spaces and

794
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
topologies but to actually get one on a

795
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
category that's not so easy

796
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
so there is something called an infinity

797
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
one site on an infinity one category

798
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,080
it's the data encoding an infinity one

799
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
category of infinity one sheaves the

800
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
sheaves see the pre-sheaves

801
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,559
inside a certain category of pre-sheaves

802
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,440
um so

803
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
um these are just like i said in chris's

804
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,039
talk these are like

805
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
ways of monitoring kind of local data

806
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,400
around a space

807
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
sheets are attached to certain spaces

808
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
and so we call

809
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,799
um a topology on a category of site so

810
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,320
what's this chromatic tower

811
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
well the chromatic tower looks like this

812
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
so um it's

813
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
actually there's a whole bunch of work

814
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
on chromatic homotopy theory just

815
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
plugging this in

816
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
but what is that right it's a way of

817
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
identifying spaces using these chromatic

818
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,480
towers

819
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
so given this ln this is a boost field

820
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
localization of what's called a maraba k

821
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
theory so these k theories are ways of

822
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
looking at isomorphism classes of vector

823
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,039
bundles

824
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,159
you have a wedge sum there um and

825
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,960
uh so this localization gluing right

826
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
localization is adding inverses

827
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,880
um so given that we call the the

828
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
homotopy limit over the chromatic tower

829
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
so there's a tower of these things

830
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
called spectra which are objects that

831
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,039
behave like co homology theories and

832
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,320
chromology theories are

833
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
exploring holes in spaces and

834
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,559
just kind of data nice invariants about

835
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,159
space because you want to classify these

836
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,200
spaces

837
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,919
and so you have these towers based on

838
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,520
the levels of spectra

839
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
so this is mo this is what i'm uh when i

840
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,960
say the p

841
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
localization of a spectrum that's uh

842
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
it's pretty detailed but

843
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
uh we're saying like it's localized with

844
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
respect to a certain p

845
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
and so without without like

846
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
super going into the details of that you

847
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
have uh

848
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
towers of equivalences and so based on

849
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
your layer

850
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,400
based on where you are on the chromatic

851
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,440
tower

852
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
is what you're going is how you're going

853
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
to be navigating

854
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,559
so that's memory space to me recall

855
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,400
memory space it's all the same

856
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
navigating your touring degree

857
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,039
is is in a sense a chromatic tower like

858
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,120
this so to create a chromatic type

859
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,440
i'm going to make uh equivalences based

860
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
on the layers of this tower

861
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,200
so for instance you know if you're on

862
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,559
the top layer making a

863
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,840
an equivalence between the top layer

864
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
and uh you know um so replacing

865
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
home never replacing but upgrading the

866
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,720
homotopy type

867
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
with chromatic type okay

868
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
so we say for memories and computability

869
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
i said uh again at that mentation talk

870
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
that i just gave not too long ago at the

871
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
biological conference

872
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
what else besides computing might be

873
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
involved in biological mentality right

874
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,679
i'm just going a little um

875
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,520
phenomenological so we can pull this

876
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,360
together but you know it's a it's a

877
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
homotopic type that could be a chromatic

878
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,840
type

879
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,720
it proceeds by weak equivalences it far

880
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
exceeds there's a lot of like expander

881
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
graphs and graph theory that model it i

882
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,080
just think it's insufficient

883
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,760
and i think that you can get into these

884
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
towers and get a little more

885
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
of what's going on so i also say memory

886
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
proceeds like an almost apology that's a

887
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,360
very strict word from

888
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
faultings uh what it means to be almost

889
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,480
but

890
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,320
we can say that memory has a singular

891
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
support like i told you like a cantor

892
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,720
set

893
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
and it's what's called a descent

894
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,840
condition in my opinion which is a

895
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,799
gluing

896
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
right so memory is recall and it's

897
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
putting everything together so you can

898
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,360
actually

899
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
localize at this specific instant

900
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
whatever that is

901
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
and so it behaves more like a descent

902
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,279
condition so again a weak equivalence is

903
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,360
a class of morphisms in a specific

904
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,000
category

905
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
computability right so there's a bunch

906
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,399
of uh stuff there's a huge msri awesome

907
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
msri conference um

908
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,840
a program um during 2020 about

909
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,279
decidability definability and

910
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,399
computability

911
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,399
so computability right is the ability to

912
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,919
solve a problem in an effective manner

913
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,440
you've got all these calculuses turing

914
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,799
computable

915
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,480
weaker automata stronger hyper

916
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,320
computation i say you know

917
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,399
i think it's the actual ability to to

918
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,320
construct descent conditions so i think

919
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
we need to take

920
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
these very strict terms about how we

921
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
navigate and

922
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
categorify them so you see me kind of

923
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,159
adding

924
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,600
like well why don't we upgrade that

925
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
upgrade the mathematics used there

926
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
um you know define abilities about

927
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
structuring knowledge and concept

928
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,159
formation decidability

929
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,080
say binary decision problem is decidable

930
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,520
there is just an effective method for

931
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,679
deriving the correct answer you know

932
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
and this it's very uh this is very kind

933
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,360
of um

934
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
clearly not you know this is not what i

935
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
was giving you in the chromatic tower i

936
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,080
think there's more ways of getting

937
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,640
around

938
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
and saying things are actually effective

939
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
if you use this sort of weak equivalence

940
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,279
kind

941
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
so memory so what else besides

942
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
information algorithms are involved in

943
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,600
biological

944
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,440
mentality well a lot you've got

945
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
geometric logic girdle and completeness

946
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,080
singular

947
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,200
support right so i call this um in my

948
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
paper with robert we come up with a

949
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,159
nested hierarchy

950
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,679
of awarenesses and i'll go over that in

951
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
about one second so i call it a oneness

952
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,320
one awareness's capacity to construct

953
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
morphisms between

954
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
other one awarenesses so we're all

955
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
relating consciousness whatever it is is

956
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,520
geometrical and relational i don't think

957
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
it's a computational

958
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
so you can get this categorical i'm

959
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,399
trying to figure out a way oh

960
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
you know we know the notion of turing

961
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
degrees let's get a categorical notion

962
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,960
of that

963
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
so um you know i say recall

964
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,679
your ability to recall is what's called

965
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,760
a localization sequence this is a

966
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,279
co-fiber sequence

967
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
where you have these maps and you have a

968
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,200
condition between functors

969
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,520
and what pops out is a fiber

970
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
and so you given so this is what i think

971
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,080
is happening when you actually recall

972
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
you look for a certain state

973
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,279
out pops a memory right so there's a

974
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
bunch of category theory going on

975
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
so what are the fundamental units of

976
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
life that's very tricky

977
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
right um there's a lot of um i think

978
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
there's a story about

979
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,159
like a beautiful monk that went up to a

980
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,279
hill to just um sort of self desiccate

981
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,120
and everyone thought he passed away but

982
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
maybe he had one heartbeat a year

983
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,720
so my question is like what what is that

984
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
what are the fundamental units

985
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
of life could it be that someone slips

986
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
under the radar

987
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,240
of what we would call metabolic life but

988
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,399
there's another set of brain waves

989
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,240
that are maybe mirror symmetries on the

990
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
other side so like you see i have this

991
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
chromatic tower with everything on the

992
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,159
right

993
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,640
side i want to build a what's on the

994
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,360
left side

995
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,200
so all of this i have chromatic towers

996
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,120
with right sides yeah so maybe this is

997
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,480
the condition of life and what if you

998
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
reflect it on the other side what does

999
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
that even mean

1000
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
um so again i'm you know playing around

1001
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,559
uh

1002
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,600
trying to figure out levels of

1003
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,519
consciousness so for instance clyde

1004
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,120
wearing the famous case

1005
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,679
um awesome pianist right super brilliant

1006
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,799
pianist um

1007
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,919
got an um i think an hpv and got an h

1008
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,960
like uh got a retrograde amnesia and so

1009
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
he's got a seven second memory and he

1010
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
only has motor memory and no personal

1011
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,120
memory

1012
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
right so you can be like you know he'll

1013
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,720
say i've never seen a doctor before in

1014
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
my life and he's visited by doctors all

1015
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,279
the time

1016
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,720
so it's very interesting with someone

1017
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
like that you have to ask the conditions

1018
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
of what are clive waring's fundamental

1019
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
units of life

1020
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
and i literally think what you could you

1021
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
can more easily categorize what's going

1022
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,480
on rather than just saying retrograde

1023
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
amnesia

1024
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,159
maybe some layers in the tower layers in

1025
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,080
the chromatic tower have been uh

1026
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,880
gone and that's what's happening so if

1027
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
layers in the chromatic tower are cut

1028
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
then you actually have uh you know so

1029
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
just like a geometric way of

1030
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
interpreting all of this

1031
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
okay so let's get to discrete time right

1032
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,760
so discrete time

1033
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
why do we model time as continuous like

1034
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,039
why

1035
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,840
again i think it's an overlook and um i

1036
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,480
just think

1037
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
we haven't focused on it so why do we

1038
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
model time as a counter or as the

1039
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,519
background for some kind of

1040
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,279
you know background dependent model

1041
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,200
right um what i have pictured here is

1042
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,360
what's called a spectral sequence

1043
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,200
and so if time looks like these series

1044
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
of dots inside the dot is encoded a

1045
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
whole bunch of information about a space

1046
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,279
so you could model time as like a

1047
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,440
modulized space and that's what i said

1048
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,919
um when chris gave us tall right so that

1049
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,600
points they're not just points right

1050
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
they actually encode

1051
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
other information but you can see that

1052
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
there are gaps between the points

1053
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,679
so if you model time as uh discontinuous

1054
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,640
or you know

1055
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,360
or discretized um what's actually in

1056
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,880
between the gaps so then we say okay

1057
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,640
well quantum mechanics model space is a

1058
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,159
non-our comedian field

1059
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,799
why is time also not not our comedian

1060
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,600
why not

1061
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
so i opened with that question what

1062
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
would it mean to phenomenologically have

1063
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,159
a discrete time what would exist between

1064
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,120
like t1 and t2 that's really rich

1065
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,960
what's actually there maybe suskin would

1066
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,399
say that's the pyramid

1067
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,919
emergence right he's got the two black

1068
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
holes entangled he thinks emergence

1069
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,440
comes from the entanglement black hole

1070
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,039
so everyone's looking at that

1071
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,320
and then you get paternitism and

1072
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,080
temporal parts again it tells you where

1073
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
you exist across

1074
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,720
time just like you exist across space so

1075
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,279
um

1076
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
i you know i asked why do we experience

1077
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
memories is time entangled with memory

1078
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
where does entanglement end that's my

1079
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,200
question

1080
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,039
how would memories actually exist in

1081
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,120
discrete time that's tricky

1082
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
that's tricky right so again you have

1083
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,399
someone like me who thinks there is no

1084
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
personal identity over time but yet you

1085
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,120
have a memory

1086
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,159
right somehow um so anyway so how would

1087
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,399
you actually define memories in end time

1088
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
i don't think there's just one timeline

1089
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,880
here

1090
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
so i put together this theory where i

1091
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,159
think you have

1092
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
the the levels of time you have is

1093
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
depending on the levels of category that

1094
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
you are and so i'm going to go over that

1095
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
so the levels of time that you are able

1096
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
to navigate depends on your complexity

1097
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,440
class and the level of

1098
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,120
uh space that you can actually navigate

1099
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,039
so how would we experience memories in

1100
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
an end time imagine you had n

1101
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,320
levels of time in a tower so uh with

1102
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
roberts and our pluralist manus paper

1103
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,599
and also the perfecto diamond paper

1104
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
right we'd say you know awareness

1105
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,280
is a it's i we can do it

1106
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,359
representationally say it's a

1107
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,119
representation of a pneuma non but we

1108
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,879
also want to throw consciousness

1109
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,239
into levels and layers

1110
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,480
so right here you have a basic notion of

1111
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,159
a one category where i have

1112
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,800
objects and i have morphisms between

1113
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,239
objects that's it

1114
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,520
so one category is contains objects and

1115
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,000
one

1116
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
morphism so just a quick category theory

1117
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
like um category is beautiful and i

1118
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,399
cannot do it justice in two seconds but

1119
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,239
i'm given just a little recap of what we

1120
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,199
need

1121
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,480
in the middle here you see a two

1122
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,719
category two category contains

1123
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,359
objects one morphisms and what we call

1124
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,359
two morphism so two morphisms or

1125
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,159
morphisms

1126
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,079
between the morphisms you see i have a

1127
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,280
map here from f1 to g2 so this fee

1128
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320
and you see i have a gamma here from f2

1129
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
to g1

1130
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,000
so that's this is getting what i think's

1131
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,560
right so

1132
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,599
basic basic complexity class can only oh

1133
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,359
hi daniel hi sarah we have an

1134
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,400
interaction that's

1135
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,720
it right but super precogs or anyone

1136
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
with total recall like me

1137
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,720
i can put a map between this interaction

1138
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
in this interaction this is what i'm

1139
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,440
talking about

1140
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
a three category three category looks

1141
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
like this you have objects you have

1142
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,119
morphisms between the objects

1143
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
you have morphisms between the one

1144
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
morphisms

1145
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,200
and you have a three morphism which is a

1146
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,280
morphism between the two morphisms you

1147
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,920
can see this

1148
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,800
f2 going this way right so this is what

1149
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,119
i'm saying right depending on your level

1150
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,440
of category your level of awareness if

1151
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,079
you are a

1152
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,800
three awareness creature you're able to

1153
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,119
to

1154
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,599
navigate this way and so that's why i

1155
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,400
said so

1156
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,160
if you're a three awareness creature you

1157
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,440
live in three time

1158
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,880
if you're a one awareness creature you

1159
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,720
live in one time um

1160
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,800
and again i just i just went on to this

1161
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
because people like me are either

1162
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,119
haunted by

1163
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,880
you know sad memories or blessed by

1164
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,240
amazing memories and time

1165
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,920
for me did not seem to go linearly it

1166
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
goes like this so we have this first

1167
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
subjective experience we have this

1168
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
nested categories of representation

1169
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,359
you've got a one awareness

1170
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,359
you've got a two awareness so that means

1171
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,280
a category of categories of

1172
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,119
representation the three awareness

1173
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
a category of category of categories of

1174
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,480
representation

1175
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,720
in awareness is our top a categories of

1176
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,160
categories of categories

1177
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
so you can see that what what what does

1178
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
this sort of correspond to is like well

1179
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
me giving you this awesome presentation

1180
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,200
being welcome

1181
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,720
in your environment and uh us also

1182
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
you know uh being at the cambridge

1183
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,079
apostles and having like

1184
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,640
tea you know so not just being able to

1185
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,480
imagine something like that but being

1186
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
able to partition your brain

1187
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
and split your consciousness and to

1188
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,520
actually be able to do that

1189
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,599
so i'm all i'm really excited about

1190
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,839
splitting consciousness and trying to

1191
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,599
physically be in multiple places because

1192
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,320
i don't think

1193
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,079
i don't think there's only one timeline

1194
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
here but to split consciousness you'd

1195
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
have to be able to do this in the brain

1196
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,480
you know um which is cool so we come up

1197
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
with so along with in time

1198
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,839
and so again you can see that with the

1199
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,359
mathematics you're able to do a lot of

1200
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,400
stuff here

1201
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,320
so within time i came up with this so

1202
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,079
you know what i think according to end

1203
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,839
time you'd have a pro finite language

1204
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,599
like what is that well if you you know

1205
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,280
any dairy dog piece or anything

1206
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
like a in his of hermetology it's going

1207
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839
to show you that the the glossomatics or

1208
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,119
the gloss seems you know your

1209
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,640
fundamental units of language if you

1210
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
open them up there's not a lot there

1211
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
but actually the process of reading is a

1212
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,560
trace it's a wild phenomena

1213
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
because you're pulling together uh so

1214
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
many pieces so we actually uh i came up

1215
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
with this awesome language scheme that

1216
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,760
was like well

1217
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
you know uh in in the one space you just

1218
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
have your normal i

1219
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,119
we you know uh me my mine

1220
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,680
but in n2 you'd have like a one eye a

1221
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,359
two eyes this is if you're in two

1222
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
awareness right if you're in the two

1223
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,680
category

1224
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,440
then you would have actually like a one

1225
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,680
eye a two eye a one me a two me if

1226
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,119
you're in a three category

1227
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,040
you'd have a one eye a two eye a three

1228
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
eye a one me a two me

1229
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
so instead of just she her there'd be

1230
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,560
like three she

1231
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,880
three her and i think that's the level

1232
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,920
of intricacy in the new language

1233
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,079
so getting to some of the physics stuff

1234
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,400
and uh going into the emergent time

1235
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,599
um so i came up with this uh idea for a

1236
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,839
perfecto dictionary again perfectoid

1237
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,160
spaces or peter schultz's brilliant work

1238
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
and i just think it's amazing

1239
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,640
and uh so i do think uh quantum physics

1240
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
needs to be a little revolutionized by

1241
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,000
replacing hilbert's space

1242
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
for the perfectoid space replacing state

1243
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,240
vectors the geometric points and i just

1244
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
gave this a talk at

1245
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,200
ucla's ipam entropy conference not too

1246
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,640
long ago and i think it was pretty well

1247
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,760
received

1248
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,200
replace the tensor product with the

1249
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,119
diamond product placed non-locality with

1250
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,200
the profinet and many copies of spa c

1251
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,560
replace superposition with these

1252
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,200
pro-ital sheaves and pro-finite sets

1253
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
the collapse of the wave function was

1254
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,200
such so tricky uh replace it with a

1255
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,040
what's called a tilting operation which

1256
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
takes us from characteristic zero to

1257
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,599
characteristic p

1258
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,520
you get these also perfectoid modular

1259
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,800
curves replace

1260
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
upgrade the holographic principle with

1261
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
the six functor formalism

1262
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,599
which is a groth and deconstruction and

1263
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,119
i'm about to show you that

1264
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,119
you can replace quantum topology upgrade

1265
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,040
it with this a tell commonology

1266
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
replace operator out again it's great

1267
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,160
but you can just upgrade stuff so i

1268
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,240
shouldn't say replace but upgrade

1269
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,560
let's let's let's uh let's replace

1270
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,960
operator algebra with a non-therian

1271
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,079
uh version and unitarity with a

1272
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,520
a certain descent data so you have this

1273
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,640
uh this is uh

1274
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,760
peter's um um six functor formalism

1275
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,240
where

1276
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,720
in a six functor formalism it is a way

1277
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
of making a theory i would say really

1278
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,560
um it's um uh it's a a

1279
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,000
a notion of um replacing

1280
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,599
poincare uh normal point correct duality

1281
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,680
with abelian chief comology and it's

1282
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,280
something called verdier duality so

1283
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
there's dualities going on here which is

1284
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,160
why i thought it'd be great

1285
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,359
to pair it with the holographic

1286
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,560
principle because the holographic

1287
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,000
principle is

1288
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,960
really fortified by juan maldocina's ads

1289
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
cft

1290
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,160
proposed duality between you know uh um

1291
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,720
like the gauge gravity duality so you

1292
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,760
have this uh

1293
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
fmfk theory thing that i'm working on of

1294
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
a diamond and you have these

1295
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,000
uh the six operations and so with these

1296
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,680
six operations these are just image

1297
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,720
functors between

1298
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,440
sheaves and um you get this notion this

1299
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,119
is what i'm thinking of

1300
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,920
so uh in quantum gravity right you have

1301
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,839
the holographic principle and it's still

1302
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,359
very kind of loosely

1303
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,960
um defined and it's it's it's a given

1304
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,079
and only a negative

1305
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,800
condition like defined by what it's not

1306
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,960
and so i think the holographic principle

1307
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,480
instead of having um

1308
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,520
ads you know anti-sitter space in the

1309
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,280
middle and the conformal field theory in

1310
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,560
the bulk that you could actually have

1311
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,640
the six functor formalism in the middle

1312
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,560
and the profinitely many copies like the

1313
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,319
diamonds um

1314
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,920
looking like the conformal field theorem

1315
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,680
this is what i'm working on right now

1316
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,640
so emergent time um so these v stacks

1317
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,440
these are

1318
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
higher dimensional diamonds and so

1319
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
they're certainly holographic

1320
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,280
uh in a sense that they encode already

1321
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
profoundly many copies of data that's

1322
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,960
already multiple on two fronts

1323
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,680
so um a v stack is a two sheaf so this

1324
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
is like you know the sheaths that hold

1325
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,440
you in cold

1326
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
encode local data so this now it's it's

1327
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:20,720
a

1328
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
it's one category up uh it takes values

1329
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
in categories rather than

1330
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
sets so you know you're going to have to

1331
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,640
shift to v stack if you want to do uh

1332
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
this profiling language

1333
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,720
so um here's a conjecture with chris and

1334
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
i you know we're trying to generalize

1335
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,359
the distinction between

1336
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,160
separable and entangled this is not easy

1337
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,800
um so

1338
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
once again recall that the geometric

1339
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
points in the diamond amorphism of

1340
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
schemes there's something called a

1341
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,480
bearwise silicon

1342
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,599
and infomorphism and this is an adjoint

1343
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,319
pair

1344
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,960
um and so okay so you have an adjoint

1345
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,000
pair these are sort of like

1346
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
inverses like inverse functions uh but

1347
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,359
they're um

1348
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
functors and so we extend this idea to

1349
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,839
the two adjoint pairs

1350
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,200
um this is f upper star um rf

1351
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,359
uh lower star for the derived category

1352
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,359
and then f lower shriek and f upper

1353
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,880
shriek shriek is a

1354
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
kind of slang for the punctuation so

1355
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
those are referring to once again the

1356
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,440
peter's operations so that's the grand

1357
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
correspondence right is going to be this

1358
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,359
um this derived category which consists

1359
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,800
precisely of the atel

1360
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,119
sheaves of these certain modules for a

1361
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,800
small diamond

1362
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,040
okay so let's get to emergent time so

1363
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,560
how what am i i'm gonna use all this how

1364
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,680
do i actually

1365
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,599
pull this together so if you consider

1366
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
the simplest case we say an event

1367
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,599
what is an event it's a i'm going to

1368
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,839
call it a topological localization of

1369
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
any particular reference frame

1370
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,440
right event is normally like i don't

1371
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,040
know simultaneity or says something like

1372
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,359
that

1373
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,960
try not to use the word simultaneity so

1374
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
we'll say a topological localization of

1375
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
somebody's reference frame

1376
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
let's consider that to be a point in the

1377
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,920
diamond topological space on that point

1378
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
is a certain site i told you right

1379
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,240
that's how you're going to get a

1380
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,280
topology

1381
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,119
we're going to call this site the pro

1382
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,119
hotel site the category of pro finite

1383
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:01,599
sets

1384
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,200
s so this is from

1385
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,599
more of peter's work on condensed

1386
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,240
mathematics so global time emerges as a

1387
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
set of continuous maps from all pro

1388
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,200
finite sets

1389
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,839
s to t so again you have these chopped

1390
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,200
up notions of time and you can get

1391
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,520
global time to emerge as the

1392
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,680
set of continuous maps from again the

1393
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,920
all the pro finite cantor sets

1394
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,319
back to t back to the topological space

1395
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,760
so global time could be considered as a

1396
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,240
sheaf of sets on this pro hotel site

1397
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
and that's called a condensed set based

1398
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,079
on his work with uh um

1399
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,240
clausen so emergent time results in

1400
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,079
passing to the larger category of she's

1401
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,599
to consider a condensed version of this

1402
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
is an f theory construction i don't want

1403
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,359
to go over too much it's a little deep

1404
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,200
so a second conjectural way to get an

1405
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,119
emergent time you can actually

1406
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,800
use diamonds and take equivalence

1407
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,280
relations of those to actually get uh

1408
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,000
the v stacks so again when i showed you

1409
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,680
the definition of diamond you

1410
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,079
took um equivalence relations of you to

1411
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,680
protel equivalence relations

1412
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
well let's upgrade and you can take

1413
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,119
actually equivalence relations of

1414
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,040
diamonds to get modulized spaces of v

1415
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,760
stacks

1416
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,319
that's pretty big so there's new work

1417
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,480
being done about how do you actually you

1418
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,880
know

1419
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,640
how about a new algebra this is peter

1420
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,240
and dustin's new work how do you do

1421
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,040
algebra and

1422
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,960
rings and modules carry a topology i

1423
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,319
think this stuff is great

1424
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,760
and this is where i'm at it's like hey

1425
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,359
we need to like

1426
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,319
rev up mathematics you need to upgrade

1427
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,920
to some physics stuff and i think

1428
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,079
um we can all learn from it so if you

1429
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,760
can turn functional analysis into a

1430
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
branch of commutative algebra

1431
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,119
that's very nice build a version of

1432
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,680
algebraic geometry allows rings

1433
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,280
of convergent power series as basic

1434
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
building blocks because my question is

1435
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
how do you actually do analysis

1436
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
in non-archimedean geometry right that's

1437
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
actually kind of tricky

1438
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,480
and exciting for a mathematician right

1439
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,359
so you want to put some kind of

1440
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,280
completeness condition on modules

1441
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
you know which are like they mimic

1442
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
vector spaces but

1443
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,040
uh the scalars are not fields they can

1444
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,560
come from the rings

1445
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,640
the coefficients of the rings and so in

1446
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
such a way that the free objects behave

1447
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,480
like some kind of power series instead

1448
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,720
okay so you can construct algebraic

1449
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,560
geometry you can start with an abelian

1450
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
category of abelian groups you have a

1451
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,000
tensor product which is just a way of

1452
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,040
organizing

1453
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,640
and then you can consider rings in this

1454
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,960
sort of category you can associate

1455
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,680
spec r with the same spa r that i showed

1456
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,800
you in the diamond

1457
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,119
and basics and open subsets can

1458
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,040
correspond to localization so look how

1459
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,280
cool this is you're using localizations

1460
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,440
to define what an open subset is you

1461
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,960
include these spec r's together along

1462
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,640
these open subsets you can form these

1463
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,599
schemes

1464
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,040
and accordingly the category of our

1465
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,119
modules glues to form the category quasi

1466
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,079
coherence sheets

1467
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,440
so again this is all uh peter's

1468
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
construction i think it's great how do

1469
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,040
you construct analytic geometry we'll do

1470
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,160
the same thing

1471
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,880
um but topological abelian groups don't

1472
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,599
form an abelian category

1473
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,599
i'll just go over this you can use the

1474
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,000
his notion of condensed mathematics

1475
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,839
to make it make things a little better

1476
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,000
you can replace topological groups

1477
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,760
with these condensed sets so here's the

1478
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,280
whole point so

1479
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,839
um this definition right the protel site

1480
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,240
of a point is the category of pro finite

1481
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,760
sets so these are cantor sets

1482
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,319
ish uh with finite jointly subjective

1483
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,160
families of maps as covers

1484
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,240
so we say a condensed set is a sheaf of

1485
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
sets on the pro-ital site

1486
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,480
so again we're working pro-finite and

1487
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,760
pro-atel because of the diamond

1488
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,800
condition

1489
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,400
so similarly a condensed group group um

1490
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,800
ring whatever um on the protel site is

1491
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,760
called that

1492
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,599
you can put a category together condense

1493
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,839
of condensed objects

1494
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,760
so this means that this whole thing is a

1495
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,920
functor so you can get a functor from

1496
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,200
certain categories

1497
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,920
and that's fine i don't want to go into

1498
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,040
this too too much

1499
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,880
so given a condensed set you can refer

1500
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,440
to t star as its underlining set

1501
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,200
so there's a canonical example that

1502
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,480
illustrates um

1503
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,640
how you would actually change to um

1504
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,200
from a topological space so let t be a

1505
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,720
topological space

1506
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,960
to t there's associated a condensed set

1507
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,160
t bar

1508
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,920
and that's defined by sending any

1509
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,680
profinite set to the set of continuous

1510
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,200
maps from s to t

1511
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,160
this satisfies both properties um it

1512
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,599
means that for any map

1513
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,359
for which the composite is continuous

1514
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,720
it's continuous

1515
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,920
so t underlined is a condensed um uh

1516
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,760
this pro finite set

1517
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,040
um yeah so why like why are we using all

1518
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
this pro finite condition well because

1519
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,520
once again

1520
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,040
it's in the language i don't want to get

1521
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,480
lost in the details so it's in the

1522
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,680
language

1523
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,200
right it's in the awareness the level of

1524
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,880
awareness that you are

1525
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,480
right dictates your whole complexity

1526
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,520
class

1527
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,119
so if and again if these spaces are pro

1528
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,400
finite spaces

1529
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
right then you need to make sure that uh

1530
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,559
what do we mean when we say localize we

1531
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,760
need to make sure we know what the open

1532
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,960
subsets are

1533
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,400
and that's why i was using like the

1534
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
pro-itel site there's you know that's

1535
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,079
just one idea there's

1536
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,319
lots of ideas how you could model this

1537
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,680
but the main takeaway

1538
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,359
that i want you know to kind of leave

1539
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,200
everybody with is like okay

1540
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,920
so what are memories like there is no

1541
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,520
synchronous reference how are we

1542
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,559
actually

1543
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,359
getting through time yeah if every point

1544
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,800
is discretized

1545
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,119
you must be getting through time uh you

1546
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:11,839
know through

1547
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,319
your localization but i'm trying to try

1548
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,480
to upgrade the consciousness level and

1549
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,280
go well

1550
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,359
you know i think you can actually

1551
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,960
upgrade the level of awareness if you

1552
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,119
can start thinking in terms of morphisms

1553
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:23,839
and

1554
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,000
uh morphisms between morphisms so um

1555
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
you get the emergent time phenomena by

1556
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,920
using the pro-ital site

1557
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,599
and then you get the diamond holographic

1558
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,440
principle by using the

1559
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
six operations and the profinitely many

1560
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,040
copies like that

1561
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,960
so uh once again you get the chromatic

1562
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,119
types from looking at these towers of

1563
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,160
localization

1564
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,760
and you can put this over a temporal

1565
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,520
logic to maybe to maybe

1566
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,119
you know figure out what's going on with

1567
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,359
clive wearing once again like where is

1568
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,559
the meaning in that

1569
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,960
um yeah okay so i put up some of my

1570
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,599
references and i think i will just

1571
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,160
stop there

1572
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,960
awesome thank you so much

1573
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,000
maybe you can unshare and then we'll

1574
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,839
be really happy to ask you some

1575
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,160
questions here to learn more

1576
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,520
all right sarah maybe take it away yeah

1577
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,319
so

1578
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,920
so that was a great brain scramble um

1579
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,720
like i guess i'm wondering actually this

1580
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,319
really comes directly from

1581
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,280
philosophy before i went on this um live

1582
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,839
stream

1583
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,839
i was looking at just where topology

1584
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,760
fits into philosophy by way of this

1585
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,319
standard

1586
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,359
insight or stanford encyclopedia and um

1587
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,280
one thing that stood out to me was was

1588
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,800
modal logic

1589
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,440
um and i found myself asking you know

1590
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,319
with all of these new um

1591
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,160
topologies or set theory or however you

1592
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,240
want to do it like

1593
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
we always kind of run into this tension

1594
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,440
between these

1595
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,559
really complicated

1596
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,559
homeomorphic whatever kind of morphic

1597
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,160
you know our ability to conceptualize

1598
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,520
these morphisms

1599
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,000
and our ability to like make use of them

1600
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,640
like

1601
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
or you know and we make these really

1602
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,319
complicated math constructs

1603
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,760
and then but at some point we have to

1604
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,079
communicate with each other and so

1605
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,640
i'm kind of wondering with any math

1606
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,599
construct and like

1607
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,400
maybe even specifically yours like how

1608
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,480
do you see the construct

1609
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,880
converging like looping back you know

1610
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,800
conceptually such that it doesn't just

1611
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,119
run away from you know from us in our

1612
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,359
ability to understand

1613
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,760
yeah so well that's why i said so for me

1614
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,559
uh thinking

1615
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,800
like those constructs are not difficult

1616
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,319
i would say the communicating part is

1617
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,520
the difficult part

1618
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,280
you know like i mean but you should

1619
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,640
watch children they're all over the

1620
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,040
place

1621
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,440
right i think i think you're here to

1622
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,079
imagine

1623
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,000
and that you actually i'm like a super

1624
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,319
synesthete so for somebody like me

1625
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,079
right i just rattled that off and you

1626
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,520
saw that that was probably the easiest

1627
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,680
thing for me but asking me to maybe

1628
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,200
replace

1629
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,599
like a cartridge in an ink like a

1630
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,319
printer

1631
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,720
that might be really difficult for me so

1632
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,559
it's interesting that when you say

1633
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,680
um how do we not lose it

1634
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,200
so i think and that's what i was saying

1635
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
i think it depends on where your brain

1636
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,400
thrives like somebody like me i love the

1637
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,640
font of like oh yeah i'm definitely a

1638
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,680
three awareness

1639
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,079
i want to think about morphisms between

1640
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,839
morphisms and morphisms

1641
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,319
and so i actually don't think they're

1642
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,119
difficult

1643
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,359
i think you you know it's something like

1644
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,200
it's just a it's just a math is just

1645
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,400
another language

1646
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
you know and if you're a person that

1647
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,880
like likes learning new languages i

1648
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,280
think

1649
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,400
there is no difficulty around it and so

1650
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,359
i don't think i

1651
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,800
for me i don't think there's anything

1652
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
hindering it because i think what's

1653
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,520
worse

1654
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,000
is to leave it in a word statement if

1655
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
you didn't have that math justifying it

1656
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,720
you would just have a sentence saying

1657
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,760
uh what like the world is unknowable

1658
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,599
or something like that right so i

1659
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,200
actually think you're just kind of

1660
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,720
displacing

1661
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,119
displacing you know you're doing physics

1662
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,200
physics is totally hard

1663
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,599
right you know like okay but let's say

1664
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,280
for example because in moto logic they

1665
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,559
were just talking about

1666
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,040
knowing versus assuming versus you know

1667
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,680
so they had these kind of conjunctive

1668
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,040
sections in a sentence and it's i mean i

1669
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,480
i don't know i think language is

1670
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
actually the hard thing and actually

1671
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,440
making math

1672
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,520
hook into language in such a way that we

1673
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,680
can actually communicate without

1674
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
exhausting each other you know like

1675
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,000
actually make the make the information

1676
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,760
transfer um is not you know once you go

1677
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,200
from like believing

1678
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,240
to assuming you get all these funky like

1679
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,640
um you know predicates or you get all

1680
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,119
these funky like um contingencies

1681
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,359
and so actually having math such you

1682
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,960
know that that works with all of these

1683
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,119
subtleties is like

1684
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,800
i don't know anyway that's that's where

1685
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,160
i'm coming from is like how do you get a

1686
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,280
math that doesn't

1687
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,960
that doesn't get like pumped by language

1688
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,720
that's funny yeah but isn't it exciting

1689
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,680
because you didn't know much about

1690
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,599
topology until i said it right

1691
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,000
but you're on an exploration and you're

1692
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,200
learning more

1693
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,240
so i don't think it's actually

1694
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,400
detracting at all right like

1695
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,079
no no i'm not necessarily detracting i'm

1696
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,640
saying um

1697
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,119
facilitate help like compressing

1698
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,240
compressing language you know

1699
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,160
compressing concepts

1700
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,880
right and i think on my end i'm not i i

1701
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,520
think that's

1702
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,680
might be deleterious i think it might be

1703
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,640
open them

1704
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,880
open all the concepts what's uh you know

1705
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,720
i don't think time exists anyway so it's

1706
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,559
like what what's the rush right

1707
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,960
i'm just fine all right so you know what

1708
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,760
i mean

1709
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,319
and one note on that is um the linear

1710
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,200
strings

1711
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,400
spoken or podcast or live stream or text

1712
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,319
right they're often ill-specified but

1713
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,160
also it it enforces

1714
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,319
a so-called temporal structure a local

1715
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,480
syntactic in a semantic structure

1716
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,720
and um whether one chooses to see these

1717
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,319
these um associations as

1718
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,559
foundational like the roots that this is

1719
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,599
growing out of

1720
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,839
like the previous literature threads is

1721
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,920
it running off away into the dark forest

1722
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,440
of the literature or is it actually

1723
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,160
anchoring

1724
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,960
in vast bodies of knowledge so really

1725
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,760
interesting this

1726
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,839
discussion oh yeah see that's a dance

1727
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,880
talk so

1728
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,359
how cool that uh what's natural for me

1729
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,960
is like math and literary right so

1730
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,599
you've got

1731
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,520
some heavy philosophers that were onto

1732
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,960
some great things and i'm like hey why

1733
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,000
don't we just

1734
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,280
fortify what they're saying with uh some

1735
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,599
diagrams and you see it's easy if i

1736
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,760
say oh maybe clive waring's chromatic

1737
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,280
tower is cut

1738
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,920
that in a certain way like the math part

1739
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,200
there is actually

1740
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
while there is a steep learning curve

1741
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,440
you're able to actually get inside of

1742
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,119
clive wearing in a way that you're not

1743
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,800
in a way that just like daniel's saying

1744
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,359
um you know retrograde amnesia okay

1745
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,200
great that's a linear word

1746
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
you need a sentence you actually need to

1747
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,319
go into that

1748
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,880
what is that and so i actually think

1749
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,599
language

1750
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,799
is um deceiving if it's actually too

1751
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:49,760
compressed

1752
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,240
and if it's actually not transparent

1753
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,160
there's a beautiful transparency in

1754
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,119
mathematics

1755
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,160
it's all there you know and again math

1756
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,000
is not perfect either right there's

1757
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,839
what is a point we have some serious

1758
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,520
problems you know you've got

1759
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,680
you've got predicative and then you know

1760
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,200
how many definitions in math or

1761
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,799
self-referencing is horrible

1762
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,440
you know so like math is not to be

1763
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,960
worshipped at all and that's why it's

1764
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,680
like oh

1765
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,599
we should just have all the languages

1766
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,040
you can see i talk about everything at

1767
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,240
once and i'm like

1768
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,000
but that's my synesthete right i think

1769
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,520
there's actually the

1770
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,760
the beautiful thing about the synesthete

1771
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,200
is that maybe you can see

1772
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,520
uh like an aerial view of things and i

1773
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,559
think for me

1774
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,040
i can do a local global just because of

1775
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,319
the way my brain works

1776
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
you know but then i was you know i was

1777
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,000
trying because i love everybody's like

1778
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,599
differences and i don't want anybody to

1779
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,359
be like anybody else and i was trying to

1780
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:39,680
say

1781
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,799
like hmm it seems that you know maybe

1782
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,720
sometimes we're one awarenesses and

1783
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,640
sometimes we're 12 awarenesses

1784
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,200
but i really i'm really interested in

1785
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,839
why

1786
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,520
um like i don't know how you two are but

1787
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,760
if like if you have total recall

1788
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,680
like or memories like have you ever had

1789
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,559
memories just come in or future memories

1790
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,760
or deja vu

1791
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,599
i'm really interested in stuff like that

1792
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,520
yeah i just wanted to clarify the the

1793
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,040
compression thing though i want to

1794
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,720
defend compression for a minute

1795
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,640
normally i would agree you know like the

1796
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,160
the connotation with that i'm like no

1797
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,480
that's

1798
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,160
bad you throw away a lot of nice

1799
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,079
subtleties but i've definitely

1800
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,400
felt um in my limited experience with

1801
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,079
philosophy i've definitely bumped up

1802
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:20,799
against

1803
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,480
um some spots where there have been

1804
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,319
words that if you know somebody once

1805
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,960
somebody

1806
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,040
hits it when somebody puts a noun to a

1807
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,559
concept to a word

1808
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,319
it's like this fantastic compression

1809
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,079
algorithm where it's like oh that's a

1810
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,200
concept

1811
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,440
somebody had and they put it into a word

1812
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,520
and now i can pack it up and

1813
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,200
like make some more space in my brain

1814
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
for other stuff and

1815
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,520
i think that is like bad practice

1816
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,040
whether it can be in math or or

1817
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,240
in words like in whatever mean means you

1818
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,559
do

1819
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,359
it's it's just it's the best so i'm

1820
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,119
always now i'm finding myself like

1821
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,520
looking for that for that ratchet you

1822
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,119
know and you would love well then you

1823
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,720
would love math but it's like then

1824
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,400
because it's all symbols right but i'm

1825
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,839
just saying yeah

1826
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,000
i guess i don't see it compressing it

1827
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,599
doesn't have this at least not for my

1828
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,440
brain like i can't

1829
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,960
i can't like it doesn't package

1830
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,559
something up so i can make more space

1831
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,400
for other things

1832
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
but it but it does because it's like oh

1833
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,599
there's a tower so you can just keep the

1834
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,359
tower in your brain and not the 800

1835
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,400
pages that got there

1836
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,040
just like when somebody puts a noun on a

1837
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,599
concept like anti-sitter space

1838
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,160
um i think yeah i mean for me it would

1839
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,319
be i would be deceiving myself to think

1840
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,079
i'm just storing the word you're not

1841
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,160
you're storing all the physics

1842
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,520
and everything in them you know what do

1843
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,280
you what do you think about that um

1844
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,160
right

1845
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,079
you know this nesting is a topic that

1846
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,240
comes up a lot so we talk about nested

1847
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,640
markov decision processes how within the

1848
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,160
active inference model just

1849
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,079
only looking at the mathematics within

1850
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,839
this one little clade of math

1851
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,319
you can nest those models but then

1852
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,680
there's also nesting that's

1853
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,920
based upon category theory not my area

1854
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,520
but it seems like there's very nuanced

1855
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,480
ways of doing

1856
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,440
nesting and relationships and so what i

1857
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,359
heard with this discussion around

1858
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,400
like a sort of a whole total system

1859
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:04,799
shift

1860
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,880
upgrade with a dictionary it's like

1861
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,040
synergetics and bucky fuller

1862
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,200
in that if you understand the interfaces

1863
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,319
interfaces between

1864
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,920
what these things are currently doing in

1865
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,520
the system you can

1866
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
take them out and like hot swap them

1867
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,440
it's like okay it's a graphics card

1868
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,880
we could make it a different graphics

1869
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,520
card or we could have the same interface

1870
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,440
and then improve what's on the other

1871
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,040
side of the interface and then it turns

1872
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,319
out to be really meta because we're

1873
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,920
working on active inference

1874
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,559
which is in a way the theory about how

1875
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,400
the interfaces work and definitely in

1876
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,000
the active inference lab we're taking

1877
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,160
a different um approach but it's like

1878
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,440
mount everest because

1879
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,280
we're you know meeting at different base

1880
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,559
camps together

1881
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
to talk with people who have different

1882
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,839
perspectives

1883
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,920
yeah yeah which is but that's where

1884
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,200
everything thrives is in the

1885
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,240
intersections

1886
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,319
right so that's yeah it's like look how

1887
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,920
much stronger math is when you hit it

1888
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,960
with philosophy

1889
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,440
also vice versa or any of this stuff or

1890
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,240
any of the bio

1891
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,640
right upgrade retrograde amnesia to a

1892
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
chromatic tower and it's like whoa

1893
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,960
you know so i think i think nothing is

1894
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,240
lost in the intersection then what did

1895
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,000
you say earlier about

1896
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,160
uh what bucky called emergence you said

1897
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,040
something cool

1898
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,079
uh emergence through emergency

1899
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,280
yeah yeah and his emergency like the uh

1900
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,960
every time i like survival or

1901
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,480
like what to actually connect that's

1902
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,640
what you said about your uh

1903
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,960
string of natural language being

1904
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,680
effortless

1905
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,760
in active inference we think about how

1906
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,040
the action is following

1907
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,839
in some sense actually on a geodesic a

1908
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,359
path of least resistance

1909
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,960
like the chemical reaction even if it

1910
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,720
releases a lot of heat and light

1911
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,880
in the context that it's in it actually

1912
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,960
is the most probable thing or the most

1913
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,040
energy releasing thing the free energy

1914
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,119
is negative and so it dissipates

1915
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,799
and um understanding how that

1916
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,559
dissipation can be

1917
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,040
brought into the informational regime

1918
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,119
with semantic flow and like a delta g

1919
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,599
for for semantic information rather than

1920
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,000
just syntax or even chemistry

1921
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,119
that's about this mapping of mappings

1922
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,599
with free energy as a nomadic concept in

1923
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,119
a way or a nexus

1924
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,400
that we connect the free energy in the

1925
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,319
chemical we develop certain experiments

1926
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,920
maybe unique predictions

1927
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,520
and then by building the math that's

1928
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,960
general enough

1929
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,599
to interface nicely we actually we nest

1930
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,559
the concepts

1931
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,920
so that we can deal with the nested

1932
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,000
systems that are more syntactic at the

1933
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,960
lower level

1934
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,720
going down into the quantum and then

1935
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,559
more semantic at the higher level

1936
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,920
into the teleological good yeah and then

1937
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,440
the semantic at the higher level right

1938
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,119
then you can invoke a homotopic type

1939
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,799
chromatic type and then you can actually

1940
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,960
you know uh all the types are nomatic as

1941
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,880
well so i like that right

1942
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,400
nothing is until it actually like

1943
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,000
spreads so i also think

1944
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,319
you know it's it's a false conception of

1945
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,359
movement

1946
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,799
if you actually think you know if you

1947
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,119
don't start from the middle and spread

1948
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,240
you know hey shayna can we

1949
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,880
um i wonder if we can anchor some some

1950
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,079
some exploration

1951
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,720
around uh one of your questions it's on

1952
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,599
the list

1953
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,160
yeah um so like but i don't remember

1954
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,040
what they are

1955
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,559
and it might be too much of a technical

1956
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,319
hassle to post them so if you could like

1957
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,280
pick

1958
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,920
one of the questions that you're

1959
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,880
bringing up

1960
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,160
yeah let me just share again and then

1961
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,078
you tell me which one you like okay okay

1962
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,359
this will be like the uh who wants to be

1963
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,160
a millionaire

1964
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,960
of right this is cool yeah

1965
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,319
who wants to be the millionaire back to

1966
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,920
the principle should we should we do a

1967
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,319
quick

1968
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,839
random number generator no pick one

1969
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,599
yeah just look at a few and then let's

1970
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,040
anchor them and then go

1971
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,920
wild whatever one okay so so actually

1972
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,240
now

1973
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,240
this helps trip my memory so and then

1974
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,440
don't forget i have these two

1975
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,839
so pick which one maybe i can like make

1976
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,440
it

1977
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,839
can you see that yeah i can't um

1978
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,480
this is something i've been tripping out

1979
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,960
on a bit

1980
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,119
so and see so measurement

1981
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,599
2-2

1982
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,960
yeah no i know where it is um i thought

1983
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,200
i might pick a second one but

1984
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,000
um that's definitely should i go with

1985
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,520
that and then you bring it down or do

1986
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,480
you want it

1987
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,920
let's go let me unshallow i can see

1988
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,520
y'all's lovely places

1989
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,000
okay we're saying what is it what is

1990
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,520
measurement right yeah go for it yeah

1991
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,520
yeah well um i

1992
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,559
i tend to take a lot of these i

1993
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,480
i'm finding that i have a attraction to

1994
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,480
taking a lot of these questions and

1995
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
putting them in some embodied form that

1996
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,079
seems to be

1997
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,000
i don't know how i'm going to do that in

1998
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,760
a thesis in such a way that i actually

1999
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,559
graduate but

2000
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,599
um this is it's really interesting to me

2001
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:56,000
i

2002
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,119
i um you know we have

2003
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,039
affordances we have tools and all these

2004
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,799
other things these kind of prosthetics

2005
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,720
that allow us to make sense of the world

2006
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,200
but i

2007
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,480
i really just think of them as

2008
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,799
prosthetics and in a sense we're

2009
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,359
we're um making sense of the world by

2010
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,920
feeling

2011
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,079
and and i mean feeling in the the one

2012
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,280
sense of like feeling

2013
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,559
you know whether or not that actually

2014
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,920
relates to emotions that's another

2015
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,920
really interesting question but

2016
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,599
um to be conservative you know i'm just

2017
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,520
talking about feeling like our tactile

2018
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,559
sense and then we use

2019
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,799
all these affordances to augment our

2020
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,079
tactical sense

2021
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,520
but so it's really interesting to think

2022
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,359
about like

2023
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,200
all this objective measurement in

2024
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,640
science and whatnot

2025
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,039
and how that's actually related to to

2026
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,000
our embodied

2027
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
like it won't be true to us at some

2028
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,839
level unless we can makes out of it to

2029
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,200
make sense out of it at an embodied

2030
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,160
level

2031
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,200
so that's is that that's as there was

2032
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,039
another kind of hook i had in philosophy

2033
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:49,359
but

2034
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,720
um i can't really remember what it is

2035
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,760
right now but that's something that's

2036
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,039
alive for me so i don't know if you have

2037
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,039
any thoughts about it

2038
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,039
yeah well i'm like super impact too

2039
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,240
right so uh

2040
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,119
to you know i i'm going to dissociate

2041
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,000
the emotional

2042
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,680
from the irrational like i don't believe

2043
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,839
in that and uh they both

2044
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,640
are equally there right the rationality

2045
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,520
is like the

2046
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,960
emotional uh guidance system so yeah

2047
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,920
when i say

2048
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,000
like when i say what is a measurement

2049
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,839
i'm just saying there's a lot

2050
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,799
that goes into that that says you know

2051
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,720
this is the fixed speed of light

2052
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,359
and this is the this and so measurement

2053
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,760
seems like it only holds

2054
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,920
up to a certain condition right this is

2055
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,000
the this is the speed of light until i

2056
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,160
change your ambient space

2057
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,319
right if you lived on a taurus or if you

2058
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,079
lived on a klein bottle if you lived on

2059
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:38,880
something else

2060
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,079
i promise you you'd have a different

2061
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,440
speed of light because that's just the

2062
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,599
illumination problem in mathematics

2063
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,000
given a strange space right and i put a

2064
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,520
point source in it

2065
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,000
what uh if you trace out all the rays

2066
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,640
right well

2067
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,839
every point in the actual shape be hit

2068
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,160
not really it won't if you have a very

2069
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,280
complicated space so

2070
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,400
for uh for me how far how far does the

2071
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:02,960
measurement

2072
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,520
hold and metrics again since i'm such a

2073
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,400
fan of like

2074
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,920
topology and sheaves and things like

2075
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,599
this the metric

2076
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,359
seems like it is uh not substantial

2077
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,319
right it is it is based on like i said

2078
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,720
inter-subjective agreement among agents

2079
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,000
so when you say um you know like

2080
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,680
i i yeah i'm not sure if your question

2081
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,599
is like is it objective or subjective i

2082
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,799
think all measurements here are

2083
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:27,760
subjective

2084
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,880
right uh and so also here's an actual

2085
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,160
problem in the measurement if you're

2086
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,000
like strict copenhagenist and stuff like

2087
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,400
that

2088
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,920
right so um nothing should quote exist

2089
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,760
right if everything is in its free form

2090
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,119
of superposition

2091
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,559
what does it actually mean to measure

2092
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,640
something without like actually limiting

2093
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,200
the thing

2094
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,280
and who's the measurement for if you

2095
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,799
crush the superposition

2096
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,039
into like one state i've measured it

2097
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,000
right

2098
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,760
i don't know what that means and i also

2099
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,440
think that the minute all your observers

2100
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,079
go away

2101
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,000
the the thing that was measured goes

2102
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,760
back into its original state

2103
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,440
so that's why i said like what is a

2104
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,119
measurement and chris and i are always

2105
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,160
talking about this

2106
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,319
right that that assumes that you are

2107
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,240
somehow independent of the thing that

2108
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,359
you're measuring

2109
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,520
and i don't know how to actually do that

2110
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,880
right i don't really know what a

2111
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,720
boundary is because if you zoom into

2112
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,280
your arm

2113
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,400
we could take like an electron

2114
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,640
transmission microscope and i'd be able

2115
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,839
to zoom into your arm in like two

2116
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,480
seconds so where'd the boundary go

2117
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,520
you know where is the boundary and that

2118
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,680
i i'm i'm very perplexed because the

2119
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,200
boundary in mathematics is like some

2120
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,599
kind of

2121
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,720
asymptote right what is an acid like you

2122
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,880
know so are you dealing with sort of uh

2123
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
asymptotes and that's that's what we're

2124
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,000
calling a measurement

2125
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,119
you know you're like a bus is this long

2126
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,839
true until i subject the bus to a lot of

2127
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,799
time or i

2128
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,880
pour gasoline on the bus and burn it you

2129
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,720
know what i mean so how long does the

2130
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,000
measurement hold you know yeah i like

2131
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,559
that so

2132
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,960
so you're yeah so i i hadn't thought

2133
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,799
about so much about context and feeling

2134
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:57,839
i was definitely like

2135
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,359
it's a fixed thing so that's that's

2136
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,440
useful to think about not really like

2137
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,200
fixed according to whom fixed for that

2138
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,000
second but

2139
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,400
like yeah everything is in free fall and

2140
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,280
like you see

2141
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,520
um i really think there is nothing

2142
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,039
periodic here i think there is no

2143
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:11,920
repetition

2144
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,440
right we have to actually account for

2145
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,680
like what leap year or something right

2146
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,000
because the calendar is off

2147
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,400
so i'm i'm really uh i'm really

2148
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,599
impressed that in

2149
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,319
our like in everybody's free fall and

2150
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,280
you know what the earth is

2151
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,039
going a thousand miles an hour east

2152
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,440
right and that if everything is rotating

2153
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,240
your own cells are popping in and out

2154
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,160
where is the measurement i'm not sure

2155
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,520
nothing is fixed

2156
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,640
so it's very silly to think that i have

2157
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,400
this measurement it's like if you only

2158
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,359
knew

2159
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,079
that you were actually working over

2160
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,280
discrete time

2161
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,960
in that moment the moment that you were

2162
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,880
measuring the bus is no longer there

2163
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,520
right so that's what i'm very very

2164
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,240
interested in

2165
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,480
i measured the bus five minutes ago but

2166
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,079
is it the same bus

2167
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,480
no and i don't know what that means so

2168
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,000
that's what like what are you actually

2169
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,760
measuring we could measure profanity

2170
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,200
many copies of the thing

2171
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,960
but you need to say that the measurement

2172
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
is of the reflection of the thing

2173
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,480
and that's that's the one thing i do

2174
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,240
like about the temporal parts work is

2175
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,039
that the bus

2176
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,319
yesterday is it really the bus today

2177
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,719
i don't know and i've always been i've

2178
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,319
always been perplexed that you know you

2179
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,238
wake up to the same space

2180
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,640
but do you really i'm not really sure

2181
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,319
and so um that's

2182
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,040
you know uh boundaries i'm really

2183
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,799
interested in boundaries and like how

2184
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,158
they actually uh

2185
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,839
how they work because i'm not really

2186
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,198
sure they do i mean clearly like i can

2187
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,319
hit my hand on a

2188
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,799
on the on the glass but that's just

2189
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,479
that's at this scale

2190
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,479
right if i so i'm just saying that a

2191
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,520
measurement

2192
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,560
if you're going to say a measurement

2193
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,120
then you need to be real precise about

2194
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,880
uh there's no time involved there's no

2195
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
this involved it's only at an instant

2196
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,399
boom this measurement holds at an

2197
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,880
instant because tomorrow who knows

2198
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,319
and what's up with the measuring stick

2199
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:55,839
like there's so many uh like quantum

2200
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,279
mechanically the meteor stick doesn't

2201
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,080
exist anyway

2202
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,399
so so i don't even know how to use all

2203
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,520
these freaking

2204
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,560
philosophical labels but i want to ask

2205
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,679
if your ambition in

2206
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,359
in trying to apply uh topology a kind of

2207
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,080
a paradigm

2208
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,839
is to arrive at some form of realism or

2209
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:16,399
are you

2210
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,839
interested in i mean i'm kind of

2211
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,238
wondering what your ground is in terms

2212
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,000
of like

2213
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,120
yeah what would be the what's the end

2214
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,439
goal

2215
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,479
in terms of like what would be the

2216
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,719
perfect math in your mind like where

2217
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,080
would it take you

2218
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,759
right yeah well i'm after those grain

2219
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,000
unified theories right so i'm after the

2220
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,238
i'm after the unifying the grand unified

2221
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,439
theories of physics with the grain

2222
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,960
unified theories of math because i

2223
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,920
actually think

2224
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,839
the math one encompasses the physics

2225
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,759
that's why you see me going hey

2226
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,439
why don't we look at like a number

2227
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,120
theoretic version of a black hole

2228
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,080
something like that

2229
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,439
because i think that in the grand

2230
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,520
unified theories of math

2231
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,600
i'm gonna get everything because i'm a

2232
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,960
super tech mark like

2233
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,719
uh level four but you're gonna you're

2234
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,480
gonna get everything you're gonna get

2235
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,560
you're gonna ever what are you gonna get

2236
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,159
oh yeah well that's why i said like oh

2237
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,760
well are you calling reality like just

2238
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,199
this little glip you got to remember

2239
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,400
that i believe in like

2240
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,520
in consciousness right so my goal is to

2241
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,120
actually partition

2242
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
the brain partition the consciousness so

2243
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,960
that you can actually experience

2244
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,280
everything at once again i don't believe

2245
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,040
in linear time i don't think it goes

2246
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,920
linearly

2247
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,000
and i'm really baffled why the brain

2248
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,040
only does that

2249
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,360
and i think it does not because i know

2250
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,520
when you're freshly formed like

2251
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,080
um a baby it's very it's such a

2252
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,360
beautiful being because

2253
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,120
you know she's like a little portal i'm

2254
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,719
like where did you come from

2255
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,040
you know like the very act of birth is

2256
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,880
something interesting because it seems

2257
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,480
like it's something that got through the

2258
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,840
interface

2259
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,239
right where did this little portal come

2260
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,679
from and i'm actually

2261
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,080
i'm not so interested in the mechanics

2262
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,000
of the interface i'm interested in

2263
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,560
breaking through the interface taking

2264
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,560
off the interface and trying another one

2265
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,920
because again i think that the 20

2266
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,440
fundamental numbers and everything that

2267
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,719
you're subjected to here

2268
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,960
and the laws of physics or whatever are

2269
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,800
just purely interface-based which i

2270
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,960
which i think is a mathematics concept

2271
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,199
it would be so rad if we were all able

2272
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,120
to take off the interface of this

2273
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,080
complexity

2274
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,719
of our current complexity and quote go

2275
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,080
somewhere else

2276
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,600
i don't mean milky way i don't mean that

2277
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,920
i mean leave this interface all together

2278
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,920
of three times of three space and one

2279
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,560
time

2280
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,719
and go find a different modulized space

2281
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,400
right and that's what i'm trying to do

2282
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,760
with i'm like oh if you could actually

2283
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,719
partition

2284
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,800
consciousness right because it seems

2285
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,320
like i don't know if y'all had like

2286
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,080
general anesthesias or like

2287
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,800
if you've ever fainted or anything um i

2288
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,719
have a like a few times just from like

2289
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,320
kind of intense things but

2290
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,440
i remember something remained

2291
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,120
it's like you might have wiped out the

2292
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,600
consciousness by general anesthesia

2293
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,440
right but you didn't take away the

2294
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,600
awareness and that's what i was very

2295
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,480
curious about

2296
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,440
that something was still there and so uh

2297
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,199
you know don hoffman and like me it's

2298
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:55,600
like

2299
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,440
i'm actually interested in what that

2300
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,800
space is right

2301
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,360
the kind of talky sensory thing like i

2302
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,280
can see that as an apparatus

2303
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,440
but i'm sorry i'm interested in like the

2304
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,600
divinity whatever the infinity not in a

2305
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,280
religious sense but like

2306
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,760
what actually transcends this because i

2307
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,440
don't think anything here is like real

2308
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,239
at all

2309
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,239
you know so when people say what's your

2310
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,320
baseline reality well it's not this

2311
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,080
i'm really always curious to get in the

2312
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,719
dream space i'm really always curious

2313
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,679
to quote sleep because when i'm asleep

2314
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,360
who's asleep

2315
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,120
oh your body is not a sleeve right

2316
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,199
because you would you know die

2317
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,360
so i'm really curious in the states that

2318
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,040
are actually

2319
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,480
i guess i could say it like this i'm

2320
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,040
trying to take subjectivity

2321
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,280
out of the interface and put it in a

2322
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,640
different setting

2323
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,080
i'm not going to have subjectivity

2324
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,920
limited by just what the body can do

2325
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,440
because there's a lot of pain a lot of

2326
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,040
pain keeps people

2327
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,640
in the body when i think you could

2328
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,640
actually be like someone else you know

2329
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,719
so if you could take subjectivity on its

2330
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,080
own exploration

2331
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,520
which is what i think mathematics is

2332
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,600
really good about doing like if i can

2333
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,239
have

2334
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,640
you know uh people like oh let's think

2335
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,400
about simultaneous like

2336
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,760
what if you know what if we were

2337
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,760
actually here and also

2338
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,520
you know at a cambridge apostle meeting

2339
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,040
that baffles people

2340
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,400
because you know you have this

2341
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,719
imagination right we're able to talk and

2342
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,000
you're you know i can say

2343
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,520
oh sarah david let's imagine like we're

2344
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,600
in hawaii swimming with the you know the

2345
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,480
sea turtles

2346
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,400
you can go there just like that what is

2347
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,320
that why can you do that

2348
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,719
what is that imaginary space so i

2349
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:27,920
actually think we're actually

2350
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,000
really gifted creatures and you have

2351
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,600
this beautiful tool

2352
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,920
called the imagination which has not

2353
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,199
been fortified

2354
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,199
so what i'm trying to do is actually put

2355
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,560
the imagination

2356
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,360
in its own little hogwarts school right

2357
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,880
like when you're young you're able to do

2358
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,239
plays and you're doing all those things

2359
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,920
then you go up and it's like taxes and

2360
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,960
like that

2361
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,800
and it's like no i actually think we're

2362
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,040
here to be creative and you can see all

2363
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,480
the philosophers that i like are

2364
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,360
vitalists

2365
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,800
right and so i think being is creation

2366
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,400
so you can see that i'm here to i think

2367
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,480
we're here to create new

2368
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,000
theories and to break through the

2369
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,679
interface now that

2370
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,360
i'm not saying people go jump in front

2371
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,719
of buses that's not what i'm saying

2372
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,679
right i'm saying

2373
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,400
it'd be cool to peek through it just

2374
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,360
sort of like

2375
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,760
how a new baby arrives i am perplexed at

2376
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,600
birth nobody can explain it

2377
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,760
and you have no idea like how something

2378
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,120
broke through um

2379
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,960
yeah the interface so where i'm after

2380
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,719
with that you see i'm using

2381
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,159
uh very beautiful mathematics

2382
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,440
i think i think life is very sacred and

2383
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,440
very beautiful and it should be

2384
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,360
um supported and and uh explained

2385
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,840
by an equally sophisticated mathematical

2386
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,360
structure so i don't really abide by

2387
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,600
this the simplest version is the best

2388
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,360
i don't know about that i actually think

2389
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,520
that what is what is sophisticated

2390
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,199
philosophically should be equally

2391
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,600
matched in sophistication mathematically

2392
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,159
and then you get a synergy and a harmony

2393
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,280
and actually

2394
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,280
then you can actually explain a grain

2395
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,320
unified theory

2396
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,679
because i really think uh i you know if

2397
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:00,320
everything

2398
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,719
is a diamond which i really think it is

2399
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,719
you know there's a lot of

2400
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,080
i think if this reality is like a

2401
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,159
modular space of diamonds then i can

2402
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,920
just easily jump to a new modulized

2403
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,320
space

2404
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,040
it's not that difficult you know i don't

2405
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,159
know if that sounds like you're like

2406
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,679
who's this little per oh yeah i'm

2407
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,920
i'm totally like an explorer i'd be like

2408
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,679
let's jump in the consciousness bus and

2409
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,320
go look at stuff

2410
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,239
because it's not just this it's not just

2411
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,840
what is i'm you know

2412
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,320
your awareness never leaves and it's

2413
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,679
awesome to kind of

2414
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,640
enter that space you know and actually

2415
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,040
like

2416
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,719
bring it here you know if you can

2417
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,640
actually bring the consciousness space

2418
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,920
to here then you're actually more

2419
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,080
synesthetic i think you know

2420
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,320
uh yeah because i i don't know where one

2421
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,880
skill ends and the brain seems to be

2422
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,280
you know a hologram itself so when

2423
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,199
everything when your central processor

2424
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,480
is a hologram

2425
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,719
it makes me really curious about what

2426
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:53,760
this space is

2427
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,080
you know

2428
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,159
i definitely don't think the brain is

2429
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,199
like this you know of course you don't

2430
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,239
want to get hit in the head

2431
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,400
obviously but it's freaky ability to

2432
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,920
rewrite

2433
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,000
right it's like a super hamming codes

2434
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,440
you've got like air correcting code in

2435
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,199
the brain obviously to keep the organism

2436
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:09,679
alive

2437
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,640
you know but um i i think you know to

2438
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,520
come up with like a

2439
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,440
you know you know like the riemann zeta

2440
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,960
function as a black hole like that's

2441
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,000
cool

2442
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,040
so i'm just kind of trying to upgrade uh

2443
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,040
you know find what is the essence of

2444
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,640
things and it's like oh is it math what

2445
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,199
is this

2446
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:29,440
you know ah the essence

2447
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,520
i'll ask one question which is how how

2448
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,480
would you imagine

2449
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,600
that this insight or this set of

2450
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,520
upgrades potentially being taught to

2451
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,719
advanced or younger

2452
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,719
students could change research or

2453
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,560
practice because i noticed words like

2454
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,400
descent condition definability

2455
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,600
decidability

2456
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,640
completeness of course so where do the

2457
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,159
sort of everyday usages of these terms

2458
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,840
come into play with how we can rethink

2459
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,760
them based upon a new level of

2460
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,120
mathematical rigor

2461
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,800
oh that's such a great question yeah i'm

2462
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,719
such an advocate for like new models of

2463
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:01,520
pedagogy

2464
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,440
right because i think the way

2465
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,679
mathematics is taught now is horrible

2466
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,000
and it makes you know everyone uh

2467
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,360
frightened it's like you're taught

2468
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,400
calculus first

2469
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,760
before logic before topology

2470
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,719
before any of it right and so it seems

2471
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,199
like

2472
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,199
you know you there people are not using

2473
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,800
the apostle book that should be the only

2474
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,239
book used for calculus

2475
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:25,360
um yeah so if you actually if you taught

2476
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,320
a category theory straight you know from

2477
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,760
the bottom up

2478
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,239
imagine the beautiful connections that

2479
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,640
would be able to be made

2480
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,360
cross-disciplinary you can see that one

2481
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,280
of my main goals is to get people to

2482
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,320
talk with each other

2483
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,080
get the mathematicians to talk with the

2484
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,480
physicists to talk with the philosophers

2485
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,719
um you know i think through category

2486
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,480
theory you would naturally embody this

2487
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,400
synesthetic thinking which is what i'm

2488
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,400
trying to be an advocate for

2489
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,320
because there's people like non-linear

2490
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,159
thinkers like me that can be easily

2491
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,480
shunned and didn't say well she works at

2492
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,159
the intersection she's not you know

2493
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,000
serious about the one topic and i'm like

2494
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,360
but the one topic

2495
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,280
is a reflection of the other topics when

2496
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,400
everything is a diamond

2497
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,199
so for me i i see that if you were

2498
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,040
introducing these beautiful words like

2499
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,520
ah

2500
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,239
descent condition and like if you start

2501
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,679
from category theory

2502
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,080
which is so minimally constructed and

2503
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,880
only

2504
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,679
and and allows you to add what you need

2505
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,920
to build your own space

2506
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,120
right you are you are able to

2507
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,960
build um um i i would say you're able to

2508
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,199
to build in accordance with your own

2509
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,159
idea

2510
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,159
versus taking another idea and chiseling

2511
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,480
it away and adding things artificially

2512
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,920
the nice thing about category theory is

2513
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,920
that these limits everything is built

2514
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,840
into the actual

2515
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,640
uh theory itself i'm not starting with

2516
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,800
something and adding and then adding and

2517
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,480
then adding and then taking away and

2518
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,400
being like what is it analysis or is it

2519
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,360
like this

2520
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,280
so you see there's there's all these

2521
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,640
ways and like you know petershaw's

2522
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,560
like reconstructing you know uh

2523
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,159
functional analysis as commutative

2524
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,159
algebra that super sent a seat

2525
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,560
because what you're doing is like taking

2526
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,159
what you thought was a difference

2527
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,840
and you're actually making it the same

2528
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,159
thing so i'm such an advocate for

2529
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,760
inclusivity and welcoming

2530
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,000
so many trains of thought and if

2531
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,280
everyone was like oh

2532
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,440
hey though that looks like just a

2533
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,120
morphism of this and this looks like a

2534
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,400
morphism of this

2535
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,719
it would actually aid research because

2536
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,800
everybody would be working together

2537
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,880
you know like can you imagine like new

2538
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,920
antidotes and

2539
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,440
um you know i'm like a mental health

2540
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,760
advocate and uh because um you know

2541
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,679
there's been a lot of stuff like

2542
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,120
i don't know i'm sure everyone has had

2543
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,640
you know elderly family members go

2544
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,120
through some you know horrible

2545
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,360
neurodegeneration and i am not satisfied

2546
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,040
with the way that the brain is being

2547
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:41,760
modeled

2548
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,880
and i'm like you know if you actually

2549
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,640
were using the morphisms or the

2550
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,920
chromatic tower idea

2551
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,920
maybe you would be able to understand

2552
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,000
what's actually going on in somebody you

2553
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,400
know

2554
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,040
um and we'd be able to relate to them

2555
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,560
empathically

2556
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,800
instead of just like this like clear-cut

2557
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,320
medicinal thing well they'll never be

2558
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,840
good again they lost their memory

2559
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,800
well we can you know no i don't think

2560
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,080
it's something that can be lost

2561
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,600
let's just try to reconstruct the

2562
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,360
morphisms you know

2563
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,080
so there's like there's so many things

2564
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,560
that i'm

2565
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,199
after with this one is unifying all

2566
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,960
these branches that are working

2567
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,719
against each other it's like when the

2568
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,239
mathematicians and the physicists

2569
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,639
honestly work together right if if they

2570
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:21,280
can

2571
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,280
and not have a bunch of egos in the way

2572
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,120
then the beauty that results you get

2573
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,000
these beautiful

2574
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,040
grand unified theories because it's like

2575
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,480
we're meant to be inclusive and

2576
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
everybody to help each other and so

2577
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,920
everybody knows that like i'm you know

2578
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,040
not an advocate for these like

2579
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,719
standardized tests and i'm gonna test

2580
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:37,920
you and i'm better than you

2581
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,600
and like i don't know why we test people

2582
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,199
to be better than everybody

2583
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,280
we could actually be working on things

2584
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,400
like this so

2585
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,239
i think it like uh it would completely

2586
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,159
revolutionize pedagogy and it would

2587
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:48,880
offer

2588
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,600
a future model of like what a what a

2589
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,280
hogwarts school could look like because

2590
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,080
then

2591
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,159
you're actually like okay hey we have

2592
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:57,360
the imagination

2593
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,320
as a gift it is a gift that you have

2594
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,040
this

2595
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,960
and so through what i'm trying what i'm

2596
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,880
doing here it's like a very

2597
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,280
creative take at learning mathematics

2598
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,320
and things like that

2599
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,679
so then you've actually welcomed into

2600
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,120
mathematics

2601
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,760
those underrepresented who identify as

2602
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,560
creatives

2603
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,639
you know i also teach at this art school

2604
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:19,679
and you know they're always like well

2605
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,360
i don't have the the best math gifts and

2606
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,360
i'm like but look at your visual skills

2607
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
and in a certain sense they they're

2608
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,960
almost the same

2609
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,719
you know so i think there's a lot of

2610
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,159
beauty like it's like diamonds and

2611
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,360
things like this were taught

2612
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,440
you know very early or even to all like

2613
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,960
a lot of people that you know if you

2614
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,199
could integrate this into the research

2615
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,199
then you would um i just think there's

2616
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,880
beauty and everyone working together i'm

2617
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,560
not a very competitive person you know

2618
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,639
reminded me of how could you imagine a

2619
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,440
way that

2620
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,800
uh that art

2621
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,040
could actually inform math rather than

2622
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,000
the reverse

2623
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,719
like not not just art but like improv

2624
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,480
improvisation improvisational arts upon

2625
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,560
somebody's drawing just free form

2626
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,960
and if you could figure out a dynamic

2627
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,800
mapping of like oh you're actually

2628
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,159
talking about

2629
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,480
this this kind of logic and you don't

2630
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,000
and you're drawing it but you're not

2631
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,440
you're not putting it to you know you

2632
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,719
don't even know that you mean that but

2633
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:17,840
you mean that

2634
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,600
that is actually kind of fascinating

2635
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,080
look how beautiful that is yeah i just

2636
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,960
got accepted to what you just said is um

2637
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,800
you know i'm an advocate for pedagogy in

2638
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,480
the creative settings so

2639
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,960
i'll do i'll do uh you know experiments

2640
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,080
like that all the time

2641
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,120
like their their topic is to design

2642
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,520
a four-dimensional university like i

2643
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,960
want a four-dimensional university i

2644
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,880
want a gymnasium featuring flying

2645
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,000
lessons

2646
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,760
right and i want a library and um i want

2647
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,679
you to talk about adinkras or dinkers or

2648
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,840
james gates air correcting codes

01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,360
these students right have minimal

2650
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,360
mathematics skills but they are

2651
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,719
in their learning analysis geometry and

2652
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,679
topology

2653
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,400
to actually make a structure that can

2654
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,400
hold flying lessons they're actually

2655
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,480
having to teach themselves

2656
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,719
a four dimensional coordinate grid

2657
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,400
that's not euclidean this is not

2658
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,080
euclidean at all it's differential

2659
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,120
geometry

2660
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,920
right it's bumpy and i said you know

2661
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,280
because it's four dimensional and they

2662
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,199
only have hyper volumes

2663
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,199
so how amazing that you know it's sort

2664
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,320
of like um

2665
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,000
you know for me it's very sad that it's

2666
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,679
only super exclusive like

2667
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,280
you know like the exeter academy that

2668
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,360
has this harkness method so what i do is

2669
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,800
i take the hardness method and i

2670
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,880
i speak it everywhere right i teach it

2671
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,639
at cal state i teach it here and all

2672
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:33,600
over the place

2673
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,040
and um that method of showing

2674
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,600
of giving a concept uh synergetically

2675
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,239
like that

2676
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,480
and showing you know just giving minimal

2677
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,920
instruction they're learning math

2678
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,120
themselves

2679
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,320
and so uh it's like you know i so i'm

2680
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,199
interested

2681
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,880
in other people who want to experiment

2682
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,480
like that you don't learn the chapter

2683
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:52,880
one

2684
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,679
this is a triangle you know nobody

2685
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,199
learns like that because the way that

2686
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,320
you actually learn

2687
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,199
uh is to integrate so you know why do

2688
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,480
students have so much problem

2689
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,360
so many problems solving word problems

2690
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,560
because they've been taught these

2691
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,480
subjects separately these subjects are

2692
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,840
not separate at all

2693
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,920
they should be taught integrated in a

2694
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,199
holistic manner

2695
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,639
and you're totally right sarah the way

2696
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,400
to get holistic manner

2697
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
like um easily digestible is in a

2698
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,639
creative way i showed my students like a

2699
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,719
um this awesome computer programmer

2700
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:25,600
solving a 4d rubik's cube

2701
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,840
i said recreate that and they actually

2702
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
had oh the four dimension does this oh

2703
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,639
it's a test

2704
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,679
oh it has that many sides so much easier

2705
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,040
than a very linear lesson

2706
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,159
this is a four space with uh that you

2707
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,360
know i think

2708
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,920
i think um uh you know if you're an

2709
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,000
intuit like me and most math

2710
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,239
comes from this intuition space you need

2711
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,400
to honor that intuition space and i

2712
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,480
i really think it's shunned so there's

2713
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,159
mathematicians like ramanujan and stuff

2714
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,760
like that who is saying

2715
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,280
i don't know where this idea came from

2716
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,040
it just came from this and you know that

2717
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,480
can be really shunted

2718
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
and so but i think a lot of this

2719
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,760
visionary stuff

2720
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,080
you know comes from um like a

2721
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,760
non-specific space

2722
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,920
and oh my god i will nurture people's

2723
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,040
creative space

2724
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,520
look how many ideas come out when you do

2725
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,320
some kind of like

2726
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,560
fun icebreaker like that right so

2727
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,080
anytime i host a conference or something

2728
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,639
you know

2729
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,639
i you know i'm like uh well you know

2730
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,400
imagine we were you know

2731
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,360
uh you know alligators you know so i

2732
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,239
have people

2733
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,320
change the space if you change oh you

2734
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,840
know you had claws what would you do

2735
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,360
with these claws you know

2736
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,920
and so it's like if you can kind of

2737
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,800
shake up

2738
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,800
you know uh the reel and turn it into

2739
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,000
something um

2740
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,679
kind of imaginary i think the

2741
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,520
imagination is more real

2742
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,440
so for somebody like me i privy the

2743
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,679
imaginary space because like this pin

2744
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,440
i think there was an idea of a pin

2745
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,080
before the pin so the pin is okay in my

2746
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,920
opinion but i still think the imaginary

2747
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,320
space

2748
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
trumps everything right you had to have

2749
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,239
the idea of the car i

2750
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,239
want to have the idea of the thing so i

2751
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,960
put a lot of my efforts into nurturing

2752
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,600
like students imaginary space you know

2753
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,600
so oh my god yeah infusing

2754
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,239
like having uh you can teach math in a

2755
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,440
creative way

2756
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,760
and that's why i'm so excited that there

2757
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,199
are these people like me you know i

2758
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,719
write books and it's like

2759
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,120
oh it's like i'm going to write i'm

2760
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,840
going to write

2761
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,639
you know um i'm going to write a girl

2762
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:19,679
and a diamond

2763
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,600
i like my opening line this is like my

2764
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,040
new book is like she slept in an

2765
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,840
hourglass

2766
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,080
why not right so that's what you're

2767
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:26,880
doing anyway

2768
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,120
and it's like oh wait through glass what

2769
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,920
is that

2770
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,400
so i can actually give you a shape i can

2771
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,480
introduce the shape to you creatively

2772
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,600
and then i can actually tell you

2773
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,040
theorems about the shape but i didn't

2774
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,560
start with the theorems

2775
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,400
right i started with this rough

2776
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,679
intuitive idea

2777
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,159
that actually had a texture to it so

2778
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,840
people go what is it like to sleep in an

2779
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,960
hourglass god

2780
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,440
does do i get eaten by the sand am i the

2781
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,360
sand does somebody turn me over what

2782
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,960
happens when the time runs out

2783
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,480
you know and so uh through people's

2784
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,000
own introspection i get some really

2785
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,360
solid thinkers

2786
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,040
and that's what i'm after i'm not after

2787
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,360
people wrote memorizing and like wrote

2788
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:05,760
test

2789
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,239
tests of course are difficult right but

2790
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,040
it's

2791
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,480
how many people remember the material

2792
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,239
after it you know what i mean like

2793
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,320
so memorizing through rote is not what

2794
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,080
i'm into i'm into actually building

2795
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,400
the inner space the inner space of

2796
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,000
independent learners

2797
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,600
who can think and who can

2798
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,000
cross-reference because again i will

2799
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,560
i'll just always say that your strongest

2800
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,120
thinkers

2801
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,520
are thinkers who can think along all of

2802
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,280
those intersections right

2803
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,280
you know if there's a problem like the

2804
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,800
rover crashes

2805
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,400
yeah you need your cs people but you

2806
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,760
also need your physics people you need

2807
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,600
your math people and that's why

2808
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,600
you know uh normally those research

2809
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,199
groups have that

2810
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,639
i don't know and daniel you may have

2811
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,239
that too right in your labs

2812
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:47,280
i bet you have people from all

2813
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,960
disciplinaries working on the inference

2814
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,159
stuff right

2815
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,040
species of every type of insect um well

2816
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,960
our approach with active inference lab

2817
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,520
is provide the affordance and the

2818
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,400
opportunity

2819
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,840
to co-design and wherever people are at

2820
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,760
in learning about active inference or

2821
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,679
curious about related topics or wanting

2822
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,040
to apply it in some

2823
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,080
domain we just sort of meet in the

2824
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,560
middle

2825
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,679
and work to use active inference as a

2826
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:14,880
unifying

2827
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,760
topic and a bridge because it um and

2828
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,400
that's

2829
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,480
really that's why you're here because we

2830
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,840
actually got to intersect with

2831
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,960
active inference coming to me all these

2832
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,560
other ideas and what you said about the

2833
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,120
book

2834
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,120
reminded me of bucky fuller's tetris

2835
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,800
scroll which is about

2836
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,440
the goldilocks and the three bears but

2837
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
the four of them are a tetrahedron

2838
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,199
and so it talks about how the tetrahedra

2839
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,719
is the minimal system

2840
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,639
and there's all these tetrahedral jokes

2841
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,000
that are embedded and so it's like

2842
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,239
learning by doing and through stories

2843
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,719
and through characters and by drama so

2844
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,400
all these creative dimensions

2845
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,360
that allow us to actually be generative

2846
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,480
within so-called

2847
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,040
alternate but today's alternate fashion

2848
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,800
is tomorrow's you know out of date and

2849
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,440
then retro

2850
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,159
it just it's historical so how do we

2851
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,840
respect rigor

2852
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,000
as well as this very radically

2853
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,199
intersubjective

2854
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,480
like you're talking about with agents

2855
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,920
with different perspectives but then

2856
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,600
also we need local logics that aren't

2857
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,600
just totally discordant because

2858
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,800
then when we're talking about the

2859
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,639
systems that sustain us

2860
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,760
um we need those to also persist so how

2861
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,960
do we

2862
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,560
how do we that was my question is how do

2863
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,960
we unify the rigor and the sort of

2864
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
almost transcendent or at least if not

2865
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,520
universal something like that with

2866
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,800
intersubjective

2867
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,600
definitions on the mortal plane right

2868
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,639
and you can actually

2869
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,639
see right in my talk i didn't give you

2870
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,800
some kind of loose map very particular

2871
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,880
right so i think i'm actually rather

2872
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,719
gifted in that regard probably why i got

2873
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,239
hired so quick with all this stuff is

2874
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:42,719
that

2875
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,120
i'm able to introduce an idea in a

2876
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,320
creative way

2877
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,320
but i give you absolute rigor so that

2878
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,760
you know it through and through

2879
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,000
right but i give you enough rigor to

2880
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,239
know that object but i also endow you

2881
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,440
with the creativity to be able to

2882
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,040
intersect it somewhere else

2883
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,280
else so we all say the mortal plane

2884
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,120
right but you won't really be aware

2885
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,040
when you pass away and you already could

2886
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,480
have you can't prove that you exist

2887
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,600
anyway

2888
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,480
right so i'm like yes respect your life

2889
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,040
force

2890
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,960
yeah but don't ever think that you're

2891
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,159
not infinite

2892
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,080
because there's no proof that you aren't

2893
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,760
right so like there's this structure

2894
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,239
like

2895
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,080
there is no structural causality you

2896
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,480
know you go somewhere but you will never

2897
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,280
be aware of it

2898
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,280
and i all i always say uh when people

2899
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,880
ask me that how do we how do we take

2900
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,560
your your lovely um

2901
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,199
you know your lovely uh um you know kind

2902
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,800
of goodies from the higher planes

2903
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,719
and like work with them here and i'm

2904
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,560
like well the higher planes are here

2905
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,520
you're in them

2906
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,679
right it's not like it's outside of you

2907
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,199
you know like you're born from the very

2908
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:39,920
universe

2909
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,639
it's all in you and it's sort of like i

2910
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,239
remember when i was trying to say like

2911
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,760
would you actually be aware when you

2912
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,120
pass so what you won't

2913
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,280
right and that's that's strange that's

2914
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,239
very strange

2915
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:52,000
so it seems to be this like impasse

2916
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,280
limiting thing

2917
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,760
all the more to value your imaginary

2918
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,560
space

2919
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,920
like i know when i'm trying to go to

2920
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,679
sleep and i'm like uh

2921
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,360
i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna actually be

2922
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,360
aware when i actually go to sleep you're

2923
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:03,920
not

2924
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,360
right when you go to sleep you just you

2925
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,520
wake up right you're never actually like

2926
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,719
aware of the moment you go to sleep

2927
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,080
right and i'm like oh that's very

2928
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,239
strange what is this awareness phenomena

2929
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,199
right so yeah there is the uh i and so

2930
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:18,719
when people call it mortal plane i guess

2931
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,000
i call it the interface

2932
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,880
that's one possible interface but again

2933
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
babies can breach through it and i also

2934
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,159
think there's other ways of getting

2935
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,960
other interfaces yeah so how you balance

2936
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,560
the rigor is that well

2937
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,920
i'm giving you some of the top

2938
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,159
mathematics like on the planet yeah

2939
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,880
so that rigor you have to be yeah for

2940
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,480
your own integrity

2941
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,560
and as a pedagogue and an intellectual

2942
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,920
of course you are

2943
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,000
you're here to make the planet better

2944
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,840
for everyone so you already

2945
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,360
you have an in integrity to uh do honor

2946
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,400
to your subject

2947
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,400
so to do honor to your subject you learn

2948
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,840
it perfectly yeah

2949
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,480
but you can also know that there's

2950
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,880
stories around it you learn the rigor

2951
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,159
but you can also how you learn the rigor

2952
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,719
could be creatively and it doesn't have

2953
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:05,760
to be through a very

2954
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,800
rote memorization right a category as an

2955
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,040
object with if you learn it in a very

2956
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,480
beautiful way

2957
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,560
then i'm also going to honor that so

2958
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,080
that's what i mean by like a creative

2959
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,719
setting

2960
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,560
i don't ever go oh yeah here's this like

2961
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,000
diamond thing and that's it

2962
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,040
no it's actually very specific but it's

2963
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,360
according to who i'm talking to

2964
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,239
if it's like super you know um uh you

2965
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:29,440
know mathematicians are already this

2966
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,360
level then i just start with that

2967
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,040
right if i'm introducing it to

2968
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,280
undergrads right i will start with an

2969
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,159
intuitive

2970
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:39,360
um an intuitive uh kind of um i don't

2971
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,120
know derivative of the thing and then

2972
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,880
actually introduce them into that

2973
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,120
because i want them to retain it i don't

2974
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,280
want them to shut down i don't want to

2975
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,920
invoke their cortisol system right so

2976
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,800
i'm really

2977
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,120
i'm an advocate for like metacognitive

2978
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,320
techniques so

2979
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,600
once i um i i'm getting a really good

2980
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,480
feel about how people learn and so the

2981
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,480
minute you know how you think somebody

2982
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,080
like me super abstract

2983
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,600
throw me the intersection of something

2984
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,840
and i'll get it right the way that you

2985
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,320
balance

2986
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,159
rigor and creativity is to know who the

2987
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,600
actual learner is

2988
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,679
yeah so who they are and it's almost

2989
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,280
like i guess i would say my pedagogy is

2990
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,440
like a harp and i'm tuning a harp

2991
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,320
because i myself am a harp so the way

2992
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,520
that you're going to actually balance

2993
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,639
the rigor

2994
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:25,760
and the creativity is for your own self

2995
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,320
to be harp like so that i can tune to

2996
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,679
the actual student

2997
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,040
oh they're more of a creative i'll try

2998
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,400
it like this oh they're more of an

2999
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,120
engineer well

3000
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,960
i'll i'll try an engineering i'll try a

3001
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,719
system way right i

3002
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,880
i just uh you know explain diamonds to

3003
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,960
like a bunch of computer science people

3004
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,440
and i turned it into data structures so

3005
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,040
if i can align it with something that

3006
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,920
they already know

3007
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,320
for me i think that learning is about

3008
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,480
having constellations in your head

3009
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,960
how many constellations do you have um

3010
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,320
can you actually link everything

3011
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,280
together

3012
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,239
and so if i'm if there's too much like

3013
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,520
quote rigor

3014
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,320
without uh you know without a creative

3015
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,040
setting

3016
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,080
i think i i have i will fail the people

3017
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,600
that don't have the constellations yet

3018
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,679
bunch of experts i could do that as well

3019
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,360
but um you know i also nobody knows

3020
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,040
nobody knows the consciousness realm

3021
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,600
nobody knows what this actually is

3022
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,760
and at least i'm open to saying that

3023
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,120
every theorem i come up with

3024
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,480
it's just a theorem some people think

3025
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,080
they're absolutely right and i really

3026
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,400
don't agree with that like at all

3027
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,040
we have rough ideas of what it means to

3028
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,480
do this and this but that's why i'm

3029
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,080
asking like

3030
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,320
what actually are the fundamental units

3031
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,840
of life you know you can tell me when

3032
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,440
the interface breaks

3033
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,600
but you can't tell me about awareness

3034
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,000
and like if i asked a neuroscience like

3035
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,159
why can i not split the consciousness

3036
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,080
right they would say well you know i

3037
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,560
don't know

3038
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,840
you know because i'm not talking about

3039
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,520
like i'm not talking about partitioning

3040
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,159
the brain

3041
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,159
and you just have like two it's like

3042
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,239
like you would see like a split screen

3043
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,520
like those old movies i'm not talking

3044
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,520
about that right i'm actually talking

3045
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,239
about

3046
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,880
double experience double experience

3047
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,360
triple experience but not just sensory

3048
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,239
you know

3049
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,159
so i think i think the way that you

3050
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,159
balance the rigor with the creativity

3051
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,400
is to also have integrity with yourself

3052
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,159
integrity to the subject

3053
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:14,639
um anyone who actually wants to learn it

3054
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,119
i wants to learn the specificities right

3055
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,040
but what's what if you don't have

3056
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,159
creativity

3057
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,679
you'll never be able to go anywhere with

3058
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,600
the rigor i give you if you're just

3059
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,520
rigorous you're just going to be there

3060
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,600
but if i can instill in you creativity

3061
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,480
and you're actually going to be able to

3062
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,080
take the rigor and link it

3063
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,719
and intersect it and again if so it's

3064
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,000
all about like

3065
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,440
why you think you know your

3066
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,199
phenomenological like state

3067
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,119
i think we're here to create new things

3068
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,040
i think being is creation

3069
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,280
so if i can give you rigor but it can

3070
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,080
also

3071
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,480
hold your imaginary space then you'll be

3072
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,080
able to take that idea like nobody else

3073
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,360
but me would take diamonds and apply

3074
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,239
them to consciousness

3075
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,960
you know what i mean right so we're

3076
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,000
getting close to

3077
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,440
close to the end of the hour but maybe

3078
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,159
um i'm kind of curious about about what

3079
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:00,639
um

3080
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,119
what started you in math like like how

3081
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,239
old you were

3082
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,360
oh totally young well i was like hmm

3083
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,560
you know i i uh i was like what is this

3084
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,600
thing you know what i mean

3085
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,119
i would stare at mirrors and i'm like

3086
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,719
that's really interesting and then

3087
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,719
um i was basically asking my parents

3088
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,080
like why am i not falling through the

3089
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,880
floor

3090
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,360
you know because i i got pretty early on

3091
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,320
that all this stuff

3092
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,520
sort of looked like it was made out of

3093
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,520
the same thing and i'm like why are you

3094
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,960
like why am i not falling through the

3095
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,400
floor like what is holding all this

3096
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,199
together

3097
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:32,480
he's also very very curious as to why i

3098
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,239
woke up in the same thing i was like why

3099
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,159
am i not a lobster tomorrow so there was

3100
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,320
some kind of stability here that i was

3101
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,600
very perplexed by

3102
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,760
i'm also an avid reader and when you

3103
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,440
read there's like a voice in your head

3104
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,080
reading and i was like who's that

3105
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,840
who is that when people are talking to

3106
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,679
themselves who is that

3107
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,400
you know i was also highly aware that

3108
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,600
when you're sleeping

3109
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,600
who was asleep nobody was asleep if i

3110
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,440
was up remembering dreams and things

3111
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,639
like this

3112
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,960
so it was very vivid you know i would

3113
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:01,760
have

3114
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,080
lots of connections with like animals

3115
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,040
and um

3116
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,719
you know not like body swap but it was

3117
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,560
super super empathic

3118
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,639
um and i would visit you know uh kind of

3119
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,239
divine places and be like oh this is

3120
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,119
exciting

3121
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,520
and so what i found is that um you know

3122
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,159
avid readers

3123
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,840
already had the literary space but i was

3124
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,280
like what are these

3125
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,159
i always thought that there was

3126
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,800
something else and so what i love about

3127
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,360
math

3128
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,400
right is that it was it was

3129
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,320
um this beautiful language and a gift

3130
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,400
that allowed me to actually

3131
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,360
think about uh higher worlds you know in

3132
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,679
a you know in a structured way

3133
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,600
and so i was like oh wow this is an

3134
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,880
actual language

3135
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,080
and i thought that there was something

3136
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,480
universal about it right but there's not

3137
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,760
a lot of dialects

3138
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,080
for math you know and it made it really

3139
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,520
simple like oh you know category theory

3140
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,080
hey i do

3141
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,159
too versus like i was teaching myself

3142
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,360
mandarin and mine i

3143
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,280
you know i still have this california

3144
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,040
kind of accent thing right it didn't

3145
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,000
work so well

3146
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,760
and so the dialects can actually hurt

3147
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,280
language but

3148
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,000
uh math seemed to be this like universal

3149
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,440
way and i was like oh hey maybe we can

3150
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:03,840
all

3151
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,360
you know figure out what this thing is

3152
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,119
again math is not it's like

3153
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,800
my version of math you can see is very

3154
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,960
philosophical right so it's like

3155
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,639
um also my favorite writer was like you

3156
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,239
know alice in wonderland and i'm like

3157
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,920
oh through the looking glass like that's

3158
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,119
cool and at the end he's doing all the

3159
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,159
syllogisms

3160
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,159
and i thought hey if you take like you

3161
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,440
know awesome like oh

3162
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,119
syllogisms i can just mess around with

3163
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,360
that and i've just messed with causality

3164
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,679
you know paradox and things like that so

3165
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,360
super avid reader getting my hands on

3166
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,480
big philosophy

3167
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,760
very young and also staying open

3168
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,320
to like to what is because i could tell

3169
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,159
that time wasn't linear and i was like i

3170
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,360
need a subject

3171
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,040
but i can actually figure all this out

3172
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,040
like time it's not linear like how can i

3173
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,080
do that and then i

3174
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,840
oh topology and spectral spaces and

3175
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,280
stuff like oh it looks like that

3176
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,960
yeah i would say it made my synthesis

3177
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,840
like comfortable

3178
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,080
you know what i mean yeah yeah

3179
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,920
cool well i'm uh i don't think i have

3180
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,239
anything else and we're getting kurds in

3181
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,440
so

3182
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,719
what do you think i uh would be remiss

3183
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,320
not to ask how you thought active

3184
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,600
inference plays into this

3185
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,880
or what you thought about active

3186
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,280
inference yeah without the end

3187
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,400
like that's what you're saying right how

3188
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,960
the interfaces actually intersect

3189
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,119
or just right what what comes to mind

3190
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,639
when you think about active inference

3191
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,880
and cybernetics and control theory

3192
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,480
and where some of this like agent in the

3193
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,000
niche goes from

3194
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,440
there's the analytical there's the

3195
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,080
philosophical and then

3196
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,400
not getting into the the theology of

3197
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,840
what's real but just like

3198
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,679
there's the agents the model about how

3199
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,360
the agent is operating in the niche

3200
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,520
so where does what does active inference

3201
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,880
make yeah well i guess

3202
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,639
um from like uh you know the way that

3203
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,239
you've defined it so again i'm

3204
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:44,880
interested

3205
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,600
into okay so here's like uh i guess my

3206
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,800
my knowledge of it right

3207
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,840
so here's an agent with uh i mean i

3208
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,320
guess

3209
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,880
right with a certain interface i quote

3210
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,719
interact with you like whatever that

3211
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:57,440
means

3212
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,760
and so in my opinion the way that things

3213
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,639
are interacting

3214
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,560
is through how many morphisms they

3215
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,159
actually generate so it's actually

3216
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,360
categorical

3217
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,040
so i don't do this sort of like

3218
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,719
analytical thing like philosoph

3219
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,719
philosophical because again i i'm from

3220
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,480
this higher space so if you just

3221
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,159
if you look at active inference maybe

3222
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,600
through category theory

3223
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,000
now what's really happening it's like oh

3224
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,840
oh interesting at what

3225
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,639
at what instant does my interaction with

3226
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,440
this like opposite agent or whatever

3227
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,679
throw me into a reflective subcategory

3228
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:28,639
where i'm actually just

3229
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,119
interacting with myself so i'm really

3230
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:31,760
interested

3231
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,639
in where uh the interface theory can

3232
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:35,440
actually

3233
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,600
uh meet topological localization like i

3234
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,800
was talking about

3235
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,280
so i think uh what see what i like about

3236
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,639
this is that it sounds like you're doing

3237
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,400
the same thing that i'm doing with which

3238
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,400
different language so a topological

3239
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,239
localization right i'm interested in how

3240
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:50,719
do you find the inverses and relate more

3241
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:51,679
and make my space

3242
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,239
stronger um you know by passing through

3243
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,080
these reflective subcategories

3244
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,320
and so if it's like oh if the active

3245
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,840
inference is how these agents are

3246
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,600
swapping and actually

3247
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,600
interacting because that's very curious

3248
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,360
it's very curious how what i'm taking

3249
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,880
your information

3250
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,600
into like my data structure and i don't

3251
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:09,920
know

3252
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,000
like what receiving looks like on that

3253
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,840
end so i would just say that

3254
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,360
categorically it sounds like we're doing

3255
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,159
the same thing

3256
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,040
and then it gets pretty meta for me when

3257
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,000
i'm sort of like

3258
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,960
uh i take your info and then it becomes

3259
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,960
part of my system and it's part of my

3260
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,960
own reflective subcategory and i like i

3261
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:27,679
don't know

3262
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:30,239
like keep moving on or something but you

3263
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,280
know if it's about if

3264
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,000
it's about how interfaces work um i

3265
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,040
still don't know how you got the

3266
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,560
original interface

3267
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,440
so um i don't know if that means

3268
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,000
anything

3269
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,920
you know some of these ideas we talked a

3270
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,639
little bit about

3271
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,600
in active inference 17 2.0.1.2

3272
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,119
because that was the paper that we

3273
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,800
focused on for those weeks by

3274
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,719
fields and glazebrook but i think what

3275
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,719
you have pointed to today really

3276
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,880
also gives us a lot of things to go over

3277
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,080
again and think about

3278
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:03,360
so maybe we can um stay in touch and

3279
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,600
if you ever want to join for another

3280
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,440
conversation or

3281
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,960
participate in any other way it'd be

3282
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,080
awesome because it's really thought

3283
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,119
provoking and i hope

3284
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:14,239
our lab enjoys it yeah so fun thank you

3285
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:15,440
so much i had a great time

3286
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:21,839
thank you bye
