"Unknown","00;00;29;20","00;00;58;11","All right. Hello and welcome everyone to act flab live livestream number 38.2 it's February 23rd 2022. Welcome to Acton Flat. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll follow good video etiquette for life trips."
"Unknown","00;00;59;28","00;01;21;21","Go to active inference dot org to learn more about how to participate in any of these live streams which are part of the comms communications organizational unit or just any other part of the lot. Right. Today in active stream number 38.2, we're going to be having our third discussion. There is the dot zero, the dot one, and now the dot two."
"Unknown","00;01;21;22","00;01;48;23","On this paper, the evolution of brain architectures for predictive coding and active inference. And maybe each of us have a few ideas in mind and I'm sure we'll come up with a few other things. Plus, if anyone's watching live, they can write a comment in the chat. So we'll start with just, uh, introduction saying anything if we want about the paper before just jumping in somewhere or somewhere else."
"Unknown","00;01;49;20","00;02;21;06","I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I will pass it to Dean I am Dean. I'm up here in Calgary, and I'm not doing very much except trying to keep up with all the papers that we're looking at in active inference. And I'll pass it down to I'm blue. I'm a research consultant in New Mexico, and I really enjoy this paper for many reasons."
"Unknown","00;02;21;09","00;02;33;20","The my background of neuroscience not, not like being a priority, but yeah, it is. So I'm excited to get into it and to discuss some of the points that I picked up with you guys."
"Unknown","00;02;35;25","00;03;15;07","OK, well, Blue joining us today, what figure can we start with or start with a blank sheet and just any of the points that you'd like to raise or we can do something else like figure four for me was like, awesome. So maybe that was my favorite figure or maybe that's the one, etc. OK. All right. So what was your just perspective on what figure four was and then what did it mean or why was it interesting for you?"
"Unknown","00;03;16;16","00;03;45;25","So I was interested in this figure and maybe like even in how this figure could be expanded in terms of hierarchical depth and temporal and temporal depth, like has more than one potential skill which isn't really like mentioned here, like temporal that's going to be thought of as like small time stuff, like what am I going to do next?"
"Unknown","00;03;45;25","00;04;08;29","What's my next action? But also like in bigger time steps, like what is the next iteration of me and how like these hierarchical depth like because that's obviously like a larger level hierarchy, like the next iteration of me as a species are the human species. Right? Like what is the next iteration of the species versus what is the next action I'm going to perform as part of the species."
"Unknown","00;04;09;09","00;04;35;07","So that was kind of an interesting like perspective or stance that they took and just really like the, the yeah, my dimensionality of this and how to kind of think about it in like a maybe like a is this like a multi dimensional space? Like, is it like in terms of like my cells, what am I going to do next?"
"Unknown","00;04;35;07","00;05;03;07","My tissues, my organs, me, my active infants lab. Like, like what, what are all these things going to do next? And also, like on that level, is that like a short time frame or is it like a large time frame? And do the timeframes differ or can like the same hierarchical level have more than one time frame or not OK, nice questions."
"Unknown","00;05;03;18","00;05;41;22","Dean, what do you think about any of that as we start to look at figure four as a starting point for talking more about what you just mentioned? Well, I think one of the one of the things we touched on in the point one was the idea that within a frame there's also north of gone all mesh so as we push through this representation from the bottom up, are we going from what might be described as an architectural existence to at the top what we might describe as architectural learning?"
"Unknown","00;05;42;02","00;06;07;02","Now, of course, if we take that position we have to be careful that we're not reinforcing the idea that it's all about constructivism all the time versus being creative right? Like, I think you need to be a little bit of both. And I'm not being creationist like not one story that carries forward all the way through time as Blue Kind of graph there."
"Unknown","00;06;07;15","00;06;41;29","But the idea that the updating matters throughout the time scale that you choose to look at. And so now the question is, is architecture the lens that we should be using to talk about how we advance from mere existence to a place that we would describe as learning I mean, that's why it was chosen here. But is that the is that is that the one way now right it's a way it's a good way."
"Unknown","00;06;42;21","00;06;49;07","Certainly make something is super, super complex into something that's just complicated. But is it the only way? I don't know."
"Unknown","00;06;51;21","00;07;30;18","Just one question of clarification. When you said this is the only way, what were you referring to? This figure for? Or what was the architecture? The idea of an architecture, right. The architectural lens as opposed to other ways that we might build out this idea of going from homeostatic existence to going from unknowing to knowing and whatever that means OK, thanks for sharing it."
"Unknown","00;07;30;18","00;08;01;02","Just to kind of maybe connect this, you mentioned architectural distance, which is within the metered space, whatever the metric is or the measure or the grids that you draw, there's a distance within a map and that's like the ecological transect. That's the blueprint that's the forensic analysis. And then that's like parametric learning because it's a distortion of parameters in a given space."
"Unknown","00;08;01;16","00;08;34;00","And then fully defined, not just like space for openness, whereas the architectural learning is at the structural level, architectural and then that was kind of like what you related to, not just the homeostatic or even the allostatic perhaps, but something that's like the sort of unknown unknown, open ended, biological, open evolutionary trajectories. Yeah. So not just sustaining it, but actually realizing it."
"Unknown","00;08;34;00","00;09;18;25","So so we'll just get a few notes like on each of these transformations, then see what other ones or like what are some situations that might model or then also return to the questions that were raised early by blue, like with the multi level self and like where are the, where's mental action or thought in this model the examples were provided of like for example, the aloe stat that took the temperature homeo state as an oddity and in their example, like the Sunrise Visual Detector and Modeler column."
"Unknown","00;09;19;12","00;09;55;16","And so that gave the anticipatory change in body temperature when the sun was viewed. But then is there a similar structure for cognition is it just like linking together senses in more and more combinatorial way? It's a very science oriented perspective. Which from an evolutionary perspective, which is what this paper is exploring, that's the one to ground further elaborations and changes on rather than trying to reverse from something like engaging in counterfactuals."
"Unknown","00;09;56;04","00;10;12;10","So just using an active inference model sometimes for a counterfactual agent, if the model says that that's OK or doing the bacteria without implying that it's doing the counterfactual explicitly, that might be possible to so."
"Unknown","00;10;14;16","00;10;40;09","So you have thermal regulation in the paper. But then the question is, is does that equate to feelings in a human being? Right like does all that that feelings cover necessarily collapse down to the example of thermal regulation? And at what point are we aware of the fact that there might be a difference between the example and the concept?"
"Unknown","00;10;40;29","00;11;06;17","Like where in this figure four is that because that blurry line that we cross, it's a good question. I don't know where it is so do you know you're talking about feelings like emotions or feelings like sensations or both? Oh, yeah, all of that, right? Like so feelings tends to take on a big sort of it's it's more detached from the example of thermal regulation."
"Unknown","00;11;07;06","00;11;34;20","And yet that's just the fact that you can ask that question proves out that maybe the one example doesn't cover all of the different aspects of the higher concept. Right. And that's where the scaling part comes in. So it's not just it's not just temporal depth that allows for that. You have to have the temporal depth and the hierarchical depth what kind of feelings are you talking about?"
"Unknown","00;11;35;12","00;12;01;25","Implies that that that there's there's more than one way that has to exist for you to come at that to ask that question. How do we where do we draw the partition? Right. So in here, they show duplication, but it kind of I'm not going to say it misleads, but it potentially mislead if you think that there's a linearity to this."
"Unknown","00;12;02;12","00;12;24;13","And in fact, a couple of times Daniel talked in the point one about the fact that there is a step function moment, there is a jump, it's not a jump, for example of it. But one example where we can't say you just go from one eye to two just because I think that was one of the examples you gave Daniel."
"Unknown","00;12;24;26","00;13;14;13","But at some over evolutionary time, there is these little progression where where if you look back on it, it seems like a rather large jump took place right let me give a few points there so that when you said like the big jumps and so in one sense that's related to the kind of discussion around complex patterns of evolution and some phenotypes or genotype regions that are very stable through long periods of time over many generations, like the ultra conserved elements in the genome that are very low mutation rates versus regions that have high mutation rates, et cetera, and then same as phenotypes like phenotypes that are very constants like the silicon fish or phenotypes"
"Unknown","00;13;14;13","00;13;57;19","that are very plastic or dynamic or ones that we just don't have the records of and then how to connect what is happening or the models that we want to make in humans, especially with computer enabled and language enabled humans. Technology enabled humans with the continuum of cognitive processes. And then you said like it's not linear. And then that kind of made you think like there's like feelings, which was still it's still a rich qualitative area, like you brought out like sensations, but also experiences and emotions."
"Unknown","00;13;58;10","00;14;44;22","And then how quickly slash securely or unambiguously can we map just that cloud of concepts just to be like it's a policy selection on attention, it's an uncertainty on valence. It's valence. Like we're doing the parametric cognitive model with this, but it's still even a little bit open. What this represents is this the evolutionary biologists doing model testing on a phylogenetic tree, or is this talking about the genomic or the neurophysiological components that have to be connected just anatomically for certain function to arise?"
"Unknown","00;14;45;10","00;15;13;00","And that is the rich area that there's so much to explore in to. Well, I think the one thing we can agree on is that it because we're talking about evolution, we're talking about history. So it is backwards looking and backwards looking is easier than looking into the future, right? So I think that's one thing we can agree on that what this is trying to do is explain perhaps how the history came about."
"Unknown","00;15;14;08","00;15;45;22","It's so one thing that the authors mentioned as well and it's kind of linked to that idea of of feelings. You know, this was a discussion about the evolution of brain architecture, but there's also the fact that brains are in bodies. They don't just exist in jars. And and for me at least, I feel like I feel like emotions not necessarily sensations, but I feel like emotions are driven in a large part by the body."
"Unknown","00;15;46;06","00;16;20;26","Like, we've we've made a huge kind of connection between like the gut and the brain and like there's probably more connections to be felt because I feel feelings, like emotions deeply in my body, like I feel them in my heart or feeling in my stomach or I feel them. And I think, you know, so I really think that the idea of like emotions are is can't be separated from some embodiment, but prediction, I think it's a mental activity or at least like I feel it in my brain."
"Unknown","00;16;22;00","00;16;41;23","So I don't know if that's the same kind of sensation that everyone has, but like prediction is in my mind a brain thing. But I know that it's also that's override of all like someone throws a ball at me like I put my hand up. Like that's a reflex. So but that's not like my brain driving my body."
"Unknown","00;16;42;14","00;17;10;28","I'm not sure really, but I know that there's some prediction that's maybe not mental that's more like physical or that's more in body is probably the right word to be you. And you kind of move into that intuitive space as well, right? Like if you think about going to the beach, I can't tell whether you're going to think about the wetness aspect of that, the the warmness part of that, the the smell of the sunscreen part of that."
"Unknown","00;17;11;25","00;17;41;06","But you're going to put that prediction. Is it going to also generate embodied emotions, even though you may not articulate them right, you're still intuiting them. You're still anticipating them. And so I'm not sure how the architecture pulls that out, especially to Daniel's point. Where are are the our form has adapted evolutionarily to the to the phenotypic or situation that we find ourselves in."
"Unknown","00;17;41;26","00;18;24;27","And going forward, with let's say with let's say that sea levels rise and suddenly you have beachfront property where for millions of years you did not. How does that affect now your emotions? Right. So I like the architectural idea of being able to take something and look at the historicity of it and be able to be able to explain it out with a little bit more confidence I'm not sure, though, I'm still struggling with being able to figure out how if we want to look ahead, we can necessarily set it up the layered way it was set up here."
"Unknown","00;18;24;27","00;19;15;00","And I really like figure four, so but I just have to categorize it and keep it where it's most useful, which is in the backwards facing part of this. That's a OK, let's return to how to use this. Right, but sounds like a good question, but we'll get there. So you brought up the brain and conflict with the body and this was just the quote from the very final lines of the paper or near the end where they acknowledge that partial perspective that they present in the paper, partial meaning just a portion of but also partial like partial to a certain view because there with a neuroscience regime of attention, and that's the contribution that"
"Unknown","00;19;15;00","00;20;02;02","was made that helps apply to other systems. Then there's another synthesis to be made and this is kind of like the opening where they just acknowledge that cognition can be extended and embodied. And it suggests that not all aspects of control need to be solved by or represented a central generative model. So it's this point that we've come to from many different angles from like the ecological and the cognitive, and then here from more of a structure learning perspective that like the representation, whether just in the model of a system or in the system's own self representation, it doesn't have to be the exact same thing as some latent variable in the outside world."
"Unknown","00;20;02;23","00;20;33;08","So it's possible to have like an effective model of climate action without a perfectly accurate model. But that has to be understood within like was brought up a space of counterfactuals of what could happen from the outside world where we really never can eradicate the total distribution and also the introduction of like unknown unknowns. And so that's the fundamental openness of the external states and the modelers view."
"Unknown","00;20;33;28","00;21;12;15","And then there's still a lot to explore with the counterfactuals of the models that the system that like the agent is can implement. But I think that gets a little bit to how to start to use it in a certain area. But yeah. Any thoughts or you want I got a question for you and soon I mean, you studied ants, for example, and they're foraging and they I think it's Section eight or I forget which section that they say foraging really, really matters."
"Unknown","00;21;12;26","00;21;34;09","I think it would point to doing this now. I think that the sort of the go forward piece of this is now when you started looking at ants, did you start from a position I don't know what your background is, but did you start from a position of sort of pulling apart the historicity of why that thing is now sort of laid out the way it is?"
"Unknown","00;21;34;09","00;22;14;19","I know there's a there's a there's a piece of that that's there. But is that is that the place where most people that begin a study start which is kind of interesting about this paper, because it to me going from existence to learning implies a certain history. And so I'm wondering how you sort of come at things when you see them foraging where where history fits in terms of that you gaining some understanding of what's happening here as opposed to then what happens Great question."
"Unknown","00;22;16;02","00;22;47;17","The topic is historicity and foraging for 400 from Dean Blue. What would you say on the topic first? How would you bring that together or what would be some important points. So I really like this idea also and I have like a completely unrelated point and then an unrelated question. So it says mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and some super interesting that I thought."
"Unknown","00;22;47;18","00;23;14;26","So point was never read the book Deep Work by Cal Newport. He talks about memorizing the deck of cards. And if you haven't read the book, read the book. But it's interesting because he goes through a very elaborate way to memorize the deck of cards and it's through building a memory palace. And so in this memory palace, you have like a place that you know very like your own house."
"Unknown","00;23;15;04","00;23;37;18","You can imagine walking through your door. You imagine the porch, the doorstep, how it looks you imagine the you know, the doorway, you know all the rooms, all the closets. Like imagine going through your house, taking a tour and exploring each room in a very systematic way. So very easy to memorize a route you would take to your house, like, say you're looking for a ghost in your closet or something hiding in your house."
"Unknown","00;23;37;18","00;23;59;11","How would you look? So so you go through your house and you see you have this palace, right, that you have in your mind. And then he talks about making every card a character, right? Like like so, you know, the queen of Hearts is, you know, Queen Elizabeth or something like who is each character in the card deck?"
"Unknown","00;23;59;21","00;24;21;19","So each character in the card that becomes a character that you memorize. So you've memorized these 52 cards of people that you know. And then and so this is an interesting play also on the socio dynamics as well as the spatial dynamics. So each character in the deck is the person that you know well. You memorize that 52 people correspond to this, 52 cards and you know the layout of your house."
"Unknown","00;24;21;27","00;24;37;28","So then you can go through the order of the deck. Anybody can do it. You can repeat back the order right away. So like you go through the cards and you say, OK, you know, you can go three or four times, then you know the entire order of the deck of cards. So this is how to we repeat back the order of a deck of cards in."
"Unknown","00;24;38;21","00;25;00;24","It's like just you memorize the order like, oh, there's the queen of hearts, she's in the closet. And, you know, like all these or who's standing in the doorway is like the first card, right? So, you know, that's walk through the house and you place these people in this spatial orientation in your house. And so and this is like a proven solid way, like the people that do these kind of memory tricks use by constructing this memory palace."
"Unknown","00;25;00;24","00;25;27;13","And I thought that that was super interesting in relation to this paper. That memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world. And I also wonder if there is like a social role that also contributes to memory. And could that social role be this kind of higher level? Alister Right. We talk about the homeostatic and that's like there's no other like you've got one type of step, right?"
"Unknown","00;25;27;13","00;25;49;02","And then in the other stuff there's other ways to kind of modify. But how many like, like in a social component, you know, to succeed in function and to actively have memory and prediction like does a tissue have memory because there's another self in this issue, does an ant have memory because it can spatially navigate for food and also it knows its friends you know, like an answer."
"Unknown","00;25;49;02","00;26;04;14","Like ants have ways to distinguish one ant from another. Ants like the very social features, like I don't think that they all think they're all the same like but cats don't definitely don't like my cats know each other. But like if you showed them like a stray cat, like they'd be really upset at the stray cat, I'm sure."
"Unknown","00;26;04;25","00;26;29;15","So, you know, animals know each other and know each other also. And so what proponent of memory is not so social and that just yeah. Tell me about that might be of that or brought that to like so so awesome it brings up a lot of the aspects that I should add too. Now just from a specifically anti perspective."
"Unknown","00;26;30;05","00;27;00;10","So you mentioned the evolutionary aspect. It's one of the themes of the paper that perhaps from foraging, but other processes too as key cognitive demands, those early challenges or like ancestry challenges giving rise to current life were faced in and met in this way. So that was the evolutionary aspect you mentioned. And then thinking about the history at multiple nested scales."
"Unknown","00;27;00;10","00;27;31;10","So like there's the history of the ant colony as a genuine model entity. Where the colony year after year kind of develops in its foraging territory as its colony personality or basically phenotype at the colony level evolve and then asterisk one, then at the next meat level, it's the recent interactions of a nest mate that induce it to forage locally, meaning retrieving a seed."
"Unknown","00;27;31;21","00;27;58;06","So like there might be an ant whose current neural or hormonal state is such that a lot of interactions with incoming foragers don't stimulate more foraging, but then there might be another ants whose status is such that a certain reduced rate of interactions with other foragers, maybe even no interactions with other foragers in the entry chamber, cause it to go on a foraging trip that foraging biology is specific to this aren't shown."
"Unknown","00;27;58;06","00;28;21;25","Here is the harvester ant, but maybe other ants to carry this asterisk to. Then there's the ant tissue and like each of the ant tissues, the brain, the different glands, the gut, they're all undergoing kind of stereotyped transitions that are called temporal polytheism, or they're going through like recent changes, like a leg was lost and then the rest of the body like adapt."
"Unknown","00;28;21;25","00;28;51;18","So that's like the history of each anatomy tissue the astrocytes kind of combine for me personally, but also just more conceptually, we're thinking about the relational view on modeling the ants, but not taking too strong a view on where phenomena should be located. In terms of nascent versus collective cognitive features, and then also the place based end of field and the long term experiments."
"Unknown","00;28;52;01","00;29;20;02","So my advisor, Professor Deborah Gordon, has done like a 30 year plus field study in Arizona. And so I was doing five years of fieldwork there, but it was like year, I don't know, 20 something or 30 something to some other number. Five years later in this space where there was a lot known about this with a long lived colony, but with turnover of the foragers."
"Unknown","00;29;20;25","00;29;47;16","And so the sort of ecological and the play space nature and then also the specific biology of this ants where the forager was just so clearly an expendable part of the process of the colony like sloughed off and some other features of the foraging biology of these ants. Pretty interesting system and it reveals a lot unlike different cognitive demands and different foraging environments."
"Unknown","00;29;48;05","00;30;21;12","So that's not even getting into the whole mental foraging or affective component. But just at the foraging level, I think you brought up an important point though, Daniel, and I'm not sure if people associate architecture with abduction, but your your advisor supervisor whatever her title was her 30 year window and then where you stepped in for your five year window as nested."
"Unknown","00;30;21;23","00;30;53;01","Yeah right right you were the you were one now nested within a larger time frame. So back to Blue's earlier point but you weren't historically looking back from the perspective. OK here's the evolutionary nature. You are now seeing yourself as relative to something that had a a greater timestamp, right? So you walked into the party and you had to ask yourself, did these ants come from this colony?"
"Unknown","00;30;53;19","00;31;31;07","So back to purposes quick. Big question of right. So it's when I come in to the situation that matters as much as if I can induce a skyscraper or deduce how much structure, structural rigidity that requires. Right? So I think this is kind of interesting now because I'm not sure if we should assume, like when you were talking about the phylogenetic trees, sometimes we just assume where we're stepping in on the on the on the branching, but I'm not sure we should make that assumption."
"Unknown","00;31;31;11","00;32;19;12","I think we have to be careful to be, as you said, very explicit, not just assumptive of where we come in in this history, because if we don't, we can end up thinking that this is sort of a linear layering, that figure for when when maybe it's more like identity. It's both stable and dynamic so it's definitely related to almost the very first comments of blue of like where's multi scale identity and multi scale systems in this hierarchical depth it may be related in some way to mold large scale systems."
"Unknown","00;32;19;12","00;32;47;02","We could draw that out, but where is that nesting that we're describing the real physical enclosure sense? And this way that mental systems can almost be modeled as nested, just like we saw in mental action. As a nesting of a cognitive model with an action model inside of it. It's like the mental is enclosing and even modeling through inclusion of the personal space."
"Unknown","00;32;47;13","00;33;25;27","But then with like a drop off going further out than what is that modeling space? And is there another operation here? Again, what are these graphs what are we seeing here, Dean? Well, my point my question is, is does it to answer Blue's question, does it do we get closer to a satisfied actor answer by looking at the mechanics of this, or do we get a better sense of it by seeing the relationship like when you were explaining the ant part, you spent a lot of time talking about relationship."
"Unknown","00;33;27;03","00;33;48;26","And I think maybe one of the things we try to do is we try to apply the operation to it when when in fact, what we should be doing is seeing the relationship in its entirety. And I don't want to say zoom out because you can still zoom out and still get bogged down in the sequencing because that's kind of what this does."
"Unknown","00;33;48;26","00;34;22;17","It says this this layer of sequencing can now build out, fractal out into these other layers, the sequencing. And I'm suggesting rather than seeing the layers, maybe it's the totality of the relationships I don't know, because you also pointed to the social piece, which is all relationship all the time, right? So I'm just wondering if we help ourselves, if we if we collapse to, oh, well, this is now explainable because we have some way of showing the sequence."
"Unknown","00;34;24;00","00;35;03;17","Sometimes that helps. But maybe in this case, it's from a from an evolutionary standpoint, it doesn't matter whether we're talking about 100,000 years ago and today, as much as the relationship of what, 100,000 years ago and today represents I don't know, just throwing it out there thanks for sharing it. Just one point on that and then we'll continue here phylogenetic trees with genomic data are usually based upon sequence alignment, followed by the fitting of a tree on the aligned sections of the sequences."
"Unknown","00;35;04;09","00;35;24;07","And so there's a lot of ways and approaches of modeling from the sequence alignment itself, from unaligned to aligned sequences, a lot of ways you could do it. And then from the align sequence matrix to the tree model, there's a lot of ways to do that. It could be a bifurcating tree. It could be like a different kind of tree, different algorithms, Bayesian, et cetera."
"Unknown","00;35;25;21","00;36;02;07","One interesting point that many have raised, but it's very challenging to deal with is that depending on how stringently you align the sequences, different sites with different histories or different information, content partially or in totality are being filtered out in a different way. So if you have a mode of evolution where like short chunks get interchanged so that locally the sequences are not changed, like domains of a protein aren't changed, but then they're switched, swapped in order, those might become nonclinical sequences."
"Unknown","00;36;03;01","00;36;27;16","And so the hope is that those kinds of genomic changes are silent with respect to the long term evolutionary history, of a species, but in the short term, other methods might be needed. But in the long term, it's the hope that by pulling back like the align sections, you can get a good signal. And so that's a pretty satisfactory approach when multiple converging threads do overwhelmingly agree."
"Unknown","00;36;28;04","00;37;05;16","But it really shows that when there's like a signal processing filtering and then a model fitting this, the information in the data can be extremely powerfully misleading because there's so much because you're getting exactly the same post normalized data whether it was total noise in total bias Al or whether your correction process over normalize for one thing or another those are kind of in that gray zone, unknown, unknown space coming into the search light."
"Unknown","00;37;06;21","00;37;32;09","And so there's the whole looking of the search light story. So maybe where do we situate active inference with respect to that, looking where the light is searching for one's keys, et cetera, et cetera? So can I just say real quick, I'm not I'm not advocating for don't show your work I believe that showing your work really matters."
"Unknown","00;37;32;23","00;37;58;28","And then when you're laying what's happening at a certain point, don't get stuck in. Well, this was this was the order of the steps that I took when I showed my work. Try and zoom out and try and understand what the reality was. Well, that's all I'm what I'm asking is that does that help being able to to to toggle back and forth?"
"Unknown","00;37;59;27","00;38;40;19","So can I just jump in here for a second and point out that we had phylogenetic trees or we had. Yeah, I guess they were called phylogenetic trees at the time, but we've had like speciation trees long before we had genetics. Right. And so, like, we can construct them based on more symmetric analysis. And something that I liked in this paper is that it really drew out the importance of the niche environment with respect to duplication, because we saw many instances of species, because we did these trees when we didn't have genetic information."
"Unknown","00;38;40;19","00;39;06;18","And so we had all of these more four metric characteristics that we thought were similar. And so we lumped these species together because they must be related because they share this more symmetric feature. But in many circumstances that was not the case. And so because of, of the similarity of the nation environment or even existing in the same niche, you know, we had evolution converge on this feature that was successful in that environment."
"Unknown","00;39;06;19","00;39;40;02","And so I think here like the idea of duplication and the authors got into that, which I thought was really cool. So so the same mechanism can evolve more than one time in parallel just because of the fitting to the niche I totally agree. Blue. So when I said multiple convergent lines of evidence, like what I was totally thinking of was how genomics, the patterns that we get from those align sequences do recapitulate and even discover unexpected but later verified relationships."
"Unknown","00;39;40;13","00;40;04;21","And so that's sort of like a measure of the unique explanations and predictions. But this tree could have been fit with phenotypic characters, as you mentioned, as it was for a long time. And then it was just a few sites in proteins and I was sort of like the 1960s and seventies was fitting with very reduced datasets and now the amount of genomic data is rapidly increasing."
"Unknown","00;40;04;29","00;40;45;20","But out of the genomics analysis, you know, the action state of file of genetics is really just this tree topology fit from a family of trees and hopefully with an uncertainty associated, whether they show it like with a bootstrap uncertainty or some other way, but then that is an artifact. Now there's a few cases where like this is in, in itself interesting, like when people have resolved some deep relationships within insects or other groups and then it helps structure thinking that can later be brought out about different traits and ecologies but it's like this is just a starting point for thinking about evolutionary histories."
"Unknown","00;40;45;20","00;41;24;26","And like you said, similar ecological or generative processes these dynamics might beget increased likelihood for certain generative model to arise. And that's like kind of what ecosystem is like a desert seed harvesting ants, whether it's in the Mediterranean or the Southwest U.S. like Polk and Miramax in the US, and then cataclysms in a in the Mediterranean regions. Like there's some similarities there but then there's other species that are more closely related that have a different foraging ecology."
"Unknown","00;41;26;06","00;42;17;17","So then how does the foraging strategy sometimes have extreme fidelity with a group like leafcutter ants, where once they're committed to being a full leafcutter ants, so to speak, evolutionarily they don't or they haven't been observed to revert back to some other mode versus other like foraging strategies at the group level, at the colony level. But it's the individual in another sense that's like very interesting thinking about foraging phenotypes on the street and why not just like any other trait that you could study, like the evolution of first spatial foraging and then the evolution of cognitive foraging, and then applying that to different search spaces, which was also explored a little in the citations here."
"Unknown","00;42;17;17","00;42;45;14","The foraging in mind and foraging in semantic fields papers. What would you say, the little circle that you brought that up, Daniel? And just because in our past conversations you brought up that the same species of and have can have different foraging patterns based upon the colony that they live in, I think that that's super interesting. And I wonder how but how could you map foraging patterns?"
"Unknown","00;42;45;14","00;43;05;27","Like can you put foraging patterns into a phylogenetic tree? Right. Like is there a tree structure that we could use to describe foraging patterns and would that relate to or map onto this brain structure tree in some way? Is there I mean, even I mean, there's a lot of diversity within the same structure, also like the same brain structure."
"Unknown","00;43;05;27","00;43;43;05","But, you know, even humans have like so let's go to the grocery store. Some, some humans out there are still like hunting, hunting and gathering, you know, to make their food so awesome. I'd go for it first so you guys can learn, learn me, school me on something here. So is there any evidence that ants all gather in the morning and the queen ant or whatever the organizing at the principal and pulls the map out and says no, I want you to take this thing that you've mapped and carry it out today."
"Unknown","00;43;43;26","00;44;21;01","And I'm not being smart aleck. I'm asking, is there some sort of an analogous evidence that they do that OK, so to the team, huddle Monday morning, stand up. No I hope that's not overgeneralizing because ants are also, of course, very diverse in their foraging strategies and a lot is unknown. But just speaking to the first approximation the queen is not a central decision maker in information router hormonally and at a slower time scale for sure."
"Unknown","00;44;21;13","00;44;59;12","But at the behavioral regulation level now in the morning for the poke in the mirror X, they would like chill and some would slowly come out and like their walking speed is temperature dependent like all insects and it just assessing maybe the humidity or damage around the nest entrance. So there's no reason why those archetypes like convergence before planning or rupture repair, which of course cannot have a planning component directly, different algorithms are going to have different levels there."
"Unknown","00;44;59;12","00;45;29;24","But because the ants symbolic behavioral communication is pretty low bandwidth probably can. So unlike the waggle dance, which is conveying like quite a lot from an information theory perspective, using symbolic means like the direction and the distance and also chemical information like about the flowers, there's a sense that like physically pull another of their nest mate to a foraging location so using memory or pheromones or like tandem run."
"Unknown","00;45;30;18","00;45;52;19","And there's probably some limited examples of being able to do some like a little bit higher order signaling and also, of course, the smell of the food and the pheromones. And so a lot of the extended features but they don't do a powwow with the queen. OK, so let me let me take what you just said and sort of feedback and maybe build on it a bit."
"Unknown","00;45;53;10","00;46;29;08","So you described a situation it's morning if morning then and behaves like so. And in the last slide of this deck, you and the phylogenetic tree you had then to now or then if so, what I'm wondering is can we can we exist in a sequential world of this then like as a homeostatic representation is if then all we need, but if we want to include temporal depth and higher hierarchical depth, we actually incorporate the inversion of that."
"Unknown","00;46;29;16","00;47;05;19","We incorporate the then if right. So that's my question. So to Blue's point earlier, where, where, where is where is this this shift or this sense of what's going on? The relationship might be the discrepancy to the first representation figure one. The discrepancy might be those people that are looking at things from an if then perspective, if this, then we should expect that from a predictive standpoint versus the then if perspective."
"Unknown","00;47;07;08","00;47;40;16","Then then the the the the critical call had to be made as the base runner was foraging for second base and a call was made. Now, if now a whole bunch of people chime in about what their interpretation of what just happened. Right. So again, I'm not sure if that's I'm not sure if only looking at it frontwards and backwards as a six as a sequence is enough."
"Unknown","00;47;40;16","00;48;33;13","I think we also have to be able to see the relationship of if then and then if from the historical view. And I think when we do that, we go from architectural existence to architectural learning OK, let me try to restate that. But I've not lost the foraging trail. So yeah, if the outcome is like the end point, then that's the if, then that's the if that if the person committed the crime, you do the time and then the sort of then if takes, it precludes if then in multiple sequences if then and uncertainties on if the ends and then it says OK, then or it's like if then if so we're kind of dumbfounded."
"Unknown","00;48;33;21","00;49;01;21","Yeah. And then that's where the outcome is a starting point. And so that is in one sense, it's teleological. Does it end directly? Where is this project going to go? Do we really expect him preferred to publish his paper on February 28th and then also it includes the next steps. So it creates a world model where there is a possible, which is a selectable set of policies that the team will achieve like the expected and preferred outcome."
"Unknown","00;49;02;03","00;49;43;14","And then it sets it up for what would be the obvious next loop of policy selection. And so if it's like if things are this good or bad with the environment in 20, 30, then this is how much damage will go to this or this way. Even if you were right it wouldn't involve the policy selection elements. And so that's probably a complex situation where the partitioning of like estimation and world policy selection, which is clearly a separate discussion that's not only being invoked here like as an example, but it just points to how those are different components of inference and then foraging like an example of if then and then as if or then"
"Unknown","00;49;43;14","00;50;08;28","if was like sometimes the colonies would pack their nest entrance with pebbles and then there'd be a thunderstorm in the afternoon. I don't think a study has ever been a totally widely observed behavior with many animals and was no exception with harvester ants. Now maybe there's thunderstorms where they fail to make pebbles or it not enough and there's probably some false positives too."
"Unknown","00;50;09;04","00;50;35;26","So we don't really know the exact success ratio. Maybe it's better than the previous day's forecast. Maybe it's worse, but it's very clear to see that the Nest mate doesn't need to have been inheriting from its evolutionary history. And its niche rain cloud modeling software. It's just picking up pebbles with a proclivity to interactions and humidity, et cetera."
"Unknown","00;50;36;12","00;51;21;16","That help colonies that have that proclivity succeed in that niche, which doesn't even mean that it was a popular phenotype like 20 years ago. As things change in a region. So that's like super interesting let's return to foraging and the foraging variation question. But first, let's see if we've completed the figure for discussion OK? And just like, is there anything else we want to add about like the main because this is kind of what the paper works towards and then there's like a little downhill roll is like we could do this algebra on the tree, but this is sort of where things get led up to true demonstration of the motifs and the connection between"
"Unknown","00;51;22;00","00;51;54;12","cognition and structures and structure learning and then like parameter learning at a behavioral or developmental time scale. And then structure changes over evolutionary time scales. So we have hierarchical depth, temporal depth, which we're also just kind of adding in a spatial component at the start, which was used in the paper with the interim modality. But maybe it could be other modalities or same there's duplication, which is kind of like parallel ization."
"Unknown","00;51;54;12","00;52;28;14","That's like adding another nest mate or another unit to the compound eye of an insect developmentally and then eye is homeostasis, which is being used here as sort of the base or root or ancestral case, which is referring at the behavioral time scale to return to a to stable point. And then also at the more evolutionary time scale, the AI operator on the homeostatic, it's like the homeostasis on homeostasis, it's keeping the structure of that model fixed."
"Unknown","00;52;29;04","00;52;53;28","And then when the homeostasis at the evolutionary time scale is open, then the structural transformations here are like the affordances from that base case, which is what's being shown like with the main one on the left being broken into these. And then each of these become the fryer for each of these next ones anything to add. Or we go to foraging."
"Unknown","00;52;55;14","00;53;45;20","OK, so very relevant question. Blue measuring foraging. So one paper though there's a bunch they're really relevant but Michelin on 2014 did a lot of literature review and visualizations of foraging strategies in different species. So these are like some of the foraging approaches like foraging archetypes and then categorized those into different traits on a tree and so that's an awesome work and something that could and should be extended and integrated with like modern databases so that somebody could submit."
"Unknown","00;53;46;23","00;54;17;11","We just saw this one going in a trail and then that kind of reduces our uncertainty about a broader model of ant foraging because it's like, oh, that's the surprising observation about this, given what we already knew about that species, for example. But how do you actually measure foraging variation within or across a species? So in this case, these in Fig. one, these are like kind of like the structure at one level."
"Unknown","00;54;17;12","00;54;54;27","They're like archetypes of structure. Now, sometimes they probably blur within each other. Like if it's two and it's tandem running, but if it's three, is it a group or is it still like pseudo tandem running, you know? So it could be a little blurriness. And also there could be different modes even within the same species or like in a continuum between a foraging column with like a trunk and a spread versus like just a spread so this is sort of like, yeah, I've got I've got to like just jump in and say like how these look like neurons like just looked like differing axons at like then dendritic fibers."
"Unknown","00;54;54;27","00;55;27;21","Like, like these are like different brain structures. So I just had to point that out because that's all. Yeah. The bottom one definitely does well, even though both of these and even this top one to the trunk together and the. Yeah, yeah. So and, and let's just say that these are sort of archetypes within a broader space and then within a given mode, then the behavioral ecologist will tend to make like a more specific measure."
"Unknown","00;55;28;07","00;55;50;19","So let's just say it's a 100% a trail forager. Then having the count to and from on the trail is a good measure. So like in the harvester as they most basically do this trunk trail on the top, so there would be like one or two or three main avenues that they were leaving the colony in for that day."
"Unknown","00;55;50;29","00;56;31;08","And then sometimes they'd be the same day to day. Other times it would be slightly different. But then what happens when one wanders off, not on a trail, is it still a forager and a lot of that space is really interesting. But suffice to say that once a foraging definition has been selected, like not just the class that it's going to be, but also how it's going to be measured in that study, then there can be like quantitative parameter comparisons, like this colony foraged at this rate in terms of number of outgoing foragers per minute, and then its neighboring colony of the same species was doing at this rate."
"Unknown","00;56;31;09","00;56;56;03","So you can do like parameter comparisons within the species, kind of have the population level and then there might be another ant species whose activity it doesn't really make to compare because it's like a different number of estimates. It has a different foraging ecology. So that's kind of where like the structure learning would come into play with comparing the ants that are tending the scale insects versus foraging for seeds versus doing whatever else they do."
"Unknown","00;56;56;11","00;57;40;09","And then within a species or perhaps across a few species that have a similar foraging ecology, it's possible to do parametric comparisons so I have a question for you, Daniel. Where does how does foraging fit architecture what do you think now? And I mean, I'm not trying to be a smart aleck here. I'm I'm really curious because most architectural analogies result in some sort of an outcome that static like there's a lot of processing that went into the outcome, but the outcome is static."
"Unknown","00;57;40;09","00;58;10;02","And I don't think that any of the representations in the in the frame that you're moving right now, although the represent the differences are appear as static. They're they're supposed to be representing. That's something that's quite dynamic. So that's where the question of the architecture piece blended with evolution might be helpful or it might be oxymoronic depending upon how you how you interpret it."
"Unknown","00;58;10;02","00;58;36;22","Right. So so looping architecture implies like there's an architect. I don't know, like in an evolutionary sense, I'm not sure like architecture is the right word. It's weird. Yeah. And I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying you have to be really really careful. And then what you what assumptions you come in with based on what you think architecture is."
"Unknown","00;58;37;17","00;59;03;02","Yeah, you're maybe you're thinking of the way I am I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying what baggage does that carry when we're talking about something that's actually quite, quite dynamic those aren't those aren't I mean, you can see the ants and the anthill as an architecture. Yes. You can take a snapshot of it. But is that what we're really talking about when we're talking about foraging?"
"Unknown","00;59;04;19","00;59;09;08","So what's the difference between a structure and an architecture? I remember that. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;59;11;20","00;59;32;15","Is it just that it's just the mantis? Yeah, I think it's more than that. But we just have to be careful that we don't we don't insert one for the other thinking that they're the same thing. That's what the whole ontology exercise is about. I mean, I got my mind changed, OK? Normally I'm the one that argues don't don't give somebody and owner's manual."
"Unknown","00;59;32;21","00;59;50;23","Get them behind the wheel. Right? They'll, they'll see their owner's manual later. But in this particular case, I'm kind of going, wait a second, we better all agree what we're talking about. So here it is. What's the difference between structure and architecture? Structure tends to be the pieces in the parts of the design and how it goes together."
"Unknown","00;59;51;03","01;00;23;16","And the finished object. Architecture defines how the final objects, looks, behaves and costs by designating how design choices are made. So architecture implies that there's some kind of agency behind the design. And that's kind of that was kind of my interpretation of it also. OK, what oh, OK. Bunch of stuff there. That last point was like the definition of architecture involves the choices rather than structure involving just the description of parts."
"Unknown","01;00;23;16","01;00;46;08","So that's kind of like the perception variation or free energy. That's like structure. Well, so we bring our it also means the entire thing. So it's not just the parts, it also means the entire object. Yes, yes. But it still doesn't involve preferences or choices. It's about description like perceptual processing is. And then the architectural definition has choices in it."
"Unknown","01;00;47;01","01;01;23;12","And then that is what you brought to like agency and also architecture. It's like a profession and an operational approach to modeling the process of building a building, though there's probably theoretical and basic architecture and all this other stuff. OK, which is a few thoughts here on like the engineering and designing. So I guess one ontology that can be helpful here is with Bucky Fuller talking about structural integrity, which is something that has static holding strength like a metal cube has static holding strength."
"Unknown","01;01;24;29","01;02;16;25","Then there's process or the pattern integrity, which is sort of like describing the lifecycle of the butterfly in the caterpillar, like a recapitulation of process. And that is a lot more like this sort of dynamic systems approach to organization rather than the build it and lock it approach because these multi skill systems always have things that are turning over at different time scales and then there's just so many mechanisms that that can be models by or actually occurs by like just in the harvester ants, it's the historicity of that colony over the years, then the nest mate and that day and it's visual memory and just how many factors come into play."
"Unknown","01;02;16;25","01;02;44;10","Then every foraging trip with an estimate level could be seen as unique and the exact combinations will just never be recapitulated. Some of the major ones can be explored and then controlled for or tested for in the lab, but that's part of the open mindedness of dynamical systems because by changing the setting you can study certain features, but then it's another step that's impossible in practice."
"Unknown","01;02;44;22","01;03;07;00","To understand how those features that were in a different environments translate to the first environments. So you can take the essential behavior of the traffic jam and then recapitulated with the simulation and the lab experiments and all this. But it's a different thing to actually put it into the design time, which is happening at a different time scale than just building the skyscraper and leaving it there."
"Unknown","01;03;07;10","01;03;59;01","But that's more like the dynamic organism so where's foraging on this and I would ask, where's is there a different kind of foraging if we're talking about sort of the sort of the, the machine learning type of foraging on this versus the, the wet foraging of an ant like is that can we actually see that those two things being quite different in terms of how those two fork foraging types plays out or are they do we, do we, do we focus on the things that are different about those two things or do we focus on the things the same about those two types of foraging blue?"
"Unknown","01;03;59;01","01;04;32;07","Also, with your foraging from a more cultural and human perspective, what we have the social for machine learning yeah. And foraging OK, so machine learning and foraging, I mean, so yeah. So I've done some modeling of foraging with edge of this modeling, but in machine learning I wonder like I mean, I know that there's information foraging, but that's usually explored from the human context, right?"
"Unknown","01;04;32;07","01;05;05;11","Like humans going out and looking for information and how long we see on a website and Twitter. So but I wonder about machine learning and like, you know, neural networks doing object classification, like is there a foraging that they do? They're like, you know, they pick up things like Chris Zola wrote a really awesome publication about, you know, how we understand how neural networks work and they kind of deconstruct ape dream that's sort of on the still, which is really cool."
"Unknown","01;05;05;11","01;05;28;01","It was like a 2018 paper but you know they look at how how does a neural network recognize a dog, you know, and or a dog and a tennis ball. And so they look for like round object and like, you know floppy ears like so there's like different neurons in the turtle in the neural network that are like learn what is the floppy ear or learn what it's like around object."
"Unknown","01;05;28;08","01;05;58;26","And so like it's this combination of different things that that the neural network learns that's pieced together to form like the dog with the tennis ball, which is it's a super interesting way to think about it. And I wonder like in training the neural network, can that be looked at as, as a type of information foraging? Right. Like the network is setting out to learn distinct pieces of a pattern that it later piece together to to make its complete image recognition."
"Unknown","01;05;59;15","01;06;30;17","So interesting I'll give it a thought on the machine learning in the and the bio origin. So you mentioned like what's there's the question of should we approach it from a similarities or a different perspective? And there's different reasons why you might approach different angles, right? Like what is the most pedagogical to someone learning about the difference versus what is the best way to approach this to a certain stakeholder who is actually applying this question in a certain context?"
"Unknown","01;06;31;09","01;07;14;22","But to get to the question outside of that, the idea of contrast came to mind because we recently had the model stream on contrastive active inference, which used machine learning. So check out that stream. But it involved a contrasting step of processing inputs before doing policy selection et cetera. So that helped scenes that are broadly similar but have a key difference that small, like where the ping pong ball is, can be learned better because there's a contrasting and that reminds me of language learning when it's like, here's fruit and here's red, and then that's a contrast that isn't going to come up in the language, but then it helps learn on that."
"Unknown","01;07;15;15","01;07;46;11","And that's not just a machine learning thing because even in the parametric modeling of SPM, statistical parametric modeling mapping, but the model making of it the contrast matrix is the experimental design. And so if it's just condition and condition B and you have ten measurements, it's just five of A, you know, five zeros and five ones. And that's like the true or false matrix that basically gets multiplied to do statistics on."
"Unknown","01;07;47;00","01;08;17;24","So whether it's a very classical parametric sparse modeling approach, which was initially all that was had by statisticians, or whether it is now things that are highly parametric or just all this other stuff with modern machine learning, the contrast is like this key piece because it's always about what signal is being detected within a data set, and then also how the difference between that sample and the population is being models."
"Unknown","01;08;18;15","01;08;45;12","And so like in parametric statistics, that's about the sample standard deviation. And then there's a slightly different equation for like the population standard deviation. If you would have kept on sampling and then it's also sometimes hard to incorporate that kind of reasoning into these more modern statistical systems where it's like very easy to overfit because there's a lot of data, but it's hard to model how that large chunk of data is related to even other segments of data."
"Unknown","01;08;46;05","01;09;22;27","So it's similar to the phylogenetic challenge but that is one that is like searching for contrast takes on a very different meaning but how is it related to foraging there's the info foraging like blue mentions, there's the path element to foraging, which might be related to like inferring the best info foraging path for somebody on their feed because it has to balance the epistemic and the pragmatic or at least it acts as if it balances the epistemic and the pragmatic."
"Unknown","01;09;22;27","01;09;28;01","So foraging could be maybe looked at in that way."
"Unknown","01;09;30;15","01;09;59;14","Yeti think what this think. What this this slide represents is, broadly speaking, not just or broadly identity I think we what we do is in that in that diagram, we we tend to differentiate. We see the levels because we've created the partitions we see the dependencies because over on the far left, we have actually blue arrows that show what that those dependencies ours."
"Unknown","01;09;59;29","01;10;27;20","And then we reintegrate it. Right. I remember when I was doing my I come back to the programing that I was doing, but I see the kids. I mean, there's a there's a migration piece to this that we have to develop, which I would consider to be the tactics which would include foraging. And then there's a tools use and or a strategy piece which is sort of the information covered has changed as measured, which is kind of the instrument instrument piece."
"Unknown","01;10;28;07","01;10;52;07","And what I kept saying to them was you kind of need to have both all the time. You need to know the difference between something that's a migration or in an action or a fulfillment in the sort of the physical space and the tools, sort of the thinking instrumental parts where you can turn what you're seeing into these models and these representations."
"Unknown","01;10;53;00","01;11;12;02","And you have to kind of be able to marry the two of them all the time. You have to be able to integrate them across these boundaries when you're trying to get into these professional settings. Now that that isn't a construction exercise, that's that's being creative because you really don't know at the end of the day how it's going to turn out."
"Unknown","01;11;12;17","01;11;37;18","But, but, but the big point that we were trying to make was don't leave one of those two things behind. Like don't get stuck because you can't go out and forage. Don't get stuck because you don't think you can draw the perfect representation of the world. It's just an instrument, right? It's I mean, even a spoon can eventually drain an ocean if you're prepared to spend enough time on it."
"Unknown","01;11;38;02","01;12;13;15","So I think that's what this representation I think that's one of the greatest gifts of this representation is it kind of lays out very clearly that there's two parts to this, how we differentiate on different eventually different duplication, parallel, parallel ization dependency, predictability, preferential time based and spatial based and then scaled based and then reintegrated it all back together into some sort of a coherency."
"Unknown","01;12;14;12","01;12;32;17","For some people, though, I think it's kind of dense. I mean, if you walked in today gee, I don't know what kind of prerequisites you would need, what kind of priors you would need to understand what the heck we're talking about. But as I said, for me, the entry point the lowest level was do you migrate, do you Toulouse?"
"Unknown","01;12;33;04","01;13;16;00","Most people already admit they can find examples of when they do both. So my question then would be so will you know that you're doing both going forward and then and if you can do that, maybe it's not quite so quite so dense or quite so mystifying so few things there. So great point that going foraging on your merry way without having all hidden states learned at the structural level or the parametric level, even conditioned on a structure so you don't even know what's out there."
"Unknown","01;13;16;13","01;13;44;20","No cognitive agent does. And at the structural in the parametric level, the inference challenge is about action. Selection under uncertainty of multiple types. The inference challenge is of action. Having subproblems involving inference on perception and causal modeling, but those are like little sub problems within a broader frame that active inference provides of like action, orientation action on policy selection."
"Unknown","01;13;44;27","01;14;27;03","And then foraging is a great setting to study policy selection. And then you brought up like that there's prerequisites that we hope to learn, but different backgrounds can come to active inference from. But like I think one takeaway from the paper would be that perhaps our cognitive foraging structure, whatever that means, but the way that we forage through linguistic and idea space and solution space, strategy space can be modeled by some graph motifs and classes and transformations, which is what the contribution of this paper is and they also describe some of the more basal or homeostatic ancestral structures."
"Unknown","01;14;27;14","01;14;54;24","So it's like you have a linear model that works for height data and it works for weight data and it works for height and weight together. It just any numbers you pass a linear model, the GLM, it's going to be basically OK, this is like another model class that can take or apply to cognitive modeling, homeostatic modeling, cognitive and homeostatic modeling all these variations that are being described here."
"Unknown","01;14;55;05","01;15;32;09","So that's just one way to put it with perhaps fewer prerequisites. And then these were interesting questions. Is this what it was? Do you migrate and do you use tools? Yeah. So if you if you're doing and when you talk about tools are you talking about provisions? And especially if you if you come to breakfast with a plan on how to build a spoon how is that going to help you eat your cereal when when you're when you're foraging exercise was to be able to move the cereal from the bowl into your mouth."
"Unknown","01;15;33;01","01;16;12;27","Right. So lots of times, especially in some of the more conventional ways we look at things, we tend to take the plan to the to the cereal bowl instead of the actual spoon. So the provisioning part is more than a plan. It's more than the words and it's more than the representations. It's the actual implements that we carry with us when we do that migration that I think really counts because if you carry a I guess, I guess you can origami a sheet of paper into a spoon, but then that's another process that you have to go through and really what you wanted was just to have the implement."
"Unknown","01;16;13;26","01;16;52;25","So so when you talk about migration, like how far is a migration? Like if you're a single cell organism like migrating through the ocean, like what the migration, maybe the migration in that case is moving around you, right? Like you don't have to be you're not doing migration in terms of me from A to B, if I'm stationary and A to B are passing by me like when the cart beside me is pulling out of the parking lot, I feel like I'm moving forward."
"Unknown","01;16;54;06","01;17;26;07","Right? That's also a migration. So that is related to what we talked about with some of the geometry, like the projective geometry and how there's the flipping between the egocentric geometric projection where it's like your very personal space and it's kind of like a distribution around you. Like there's me in the center or located somewhere, and then there's like things closer to the eyes are generated to be bigger because they don't have to be because we know we're making the generative model anyway."
"Unknown","01;17;26;13","01;18;01;22","So why does it, why can't I see it from Grand Theft Auto perspective? It is a certain way for certain reason. So then that is flipping and that's flipping with the more like objective or depersonalized stance, like the prior on the architecture structurally of my room with a right angle. And even if it looks different than a 90 degree angle in the generative model that's perceived as normal or unsurprising, because it's compatible with the underlying structural hypothesis that's unobserved."
"Unknown","01;18;02;01","01;18;32;01","And then the observed structural observation that has to do with the actual way that the angles look so here's just one other kind of Professor Gordon shout out slash angle to look into evolution of algorithms for collective behavior. So let's connect this to the cognitive foraging and then Dean's questions Do you migrate? Do you use tools and do you provision?"
"Unknown","01;18;32;17","01;18;57;13","So that's like related questions to that. One might be like, how how do you adapt when things change and you can't adjust certain things or also the difference between like, let's just say I'm using a software I'm not very familiar with, like Photoshop between doing one move, Photoshop searching on a search engine. How do I paste? OK, paste."
"Unknown","01;18;57;13","01;19;17;02","OK, I do one move. So it's like a one step model of function versus someone who just rolls out of bed, opens up Photoshop, and then they just open their mind to being creative and being in feedback with what they actually do. And maybe that does involve still using a search engine, but they're in a functional flow with respect to that tool."
"Unknown","01;19;17;15","01;19;47;08","And they've just set aside the time so that their regime of attention can be like productive or aligned with a project. But they're not going step by step. They're engaged in broader organization so we're talking about figuring out part rather than the finding. That's what you just described. The difference between those two things you're opening space for figuring out or figuring out."
"Unknown","01;19;48;18","01;20;13;12","And that's sort of like it's a little bit like local and more Mizo or Global Foraging, which is like you can dig in a given patch of dirt so it's super labor intensive, but it's a local finding of what is there versus trying to find a better patch of dirt and dig there for seed, maybe even find an exposed seed."
"Unknown","01;20;13;27","01;20;38;17","But whether one of those policies is like has a higher risk reward or energy expenditure, that's going to depend a lot on what one believes about the frequency of like half emerged seeds and seeds in this location and the time cost of moving from location to location. There's just a ton of features. And it's not just like as simple as making a heat map of where the seeds are we."
"Unknown","01;20;39;02","01;21;07;25","We would describe it as mimic foraging and mimic foraging and what was the other one? Modify foraging something like a blue. Go for it. So it's interesting. At the conference, I was at a week that, you know, they talked about like how far can you get mimic an expert? And there were several like talks like so, you know, whether it's navigating a maze or, you know, figuring out what."
"Unknown","01;21;08;00","01;21;41;12","So like, you know, they'll train a model and a whole bunch of expert. What would an expert do? And then they set them loose in like a novel circumstance. And if the novel circumstance is similar enough, it kind of works. But but really, like the better thing to do is to put some exploratory component in there. So, you know, you have like the expert training but if there's an explorer component about that doesn't have to do with an expert or like, you know, if we train it to navigate its own maze also sometimes like alternating with its own maze or or a maze with experts in it."
"Unknown","01;21;42;03","01;22;16;25","So like following the experts only gets you so far. And I wonder, and something that's come to really mean a lot to me in the field of intelligence is like when it's it's when there's innovation, like when you can do something new, when you can generalize and solve any maze because you lack from a few experts, like that's innovative or, you know, like the ability to generalize but also the ability to innovate and produce some new output rather than just do what the experts do so that's one thought that's awesome."
"Unknown","01;22;16;25","01;23;03;06","Comments blue like learning from examples and from experts usually learning by example when used not in a malicious way is referring to seeing somebody who is better or at least adequate if not far, far better and then there's this question of like, should it be shown only at the expert level? Because the expert speaker would do tongue twisters and Russian sentences with five conjugations, but the the expert in interaction is able to approach a zone of agreement and of like proximal development so that the example and the expertize as applied is in a very specific space."
"Unknown","01;23;03;22","01;23;32;23","And that's like the order of examples and a knowledge like this person is able to conjugate this thing, but they're having challenging conjugating this case so then depending on their personality, maybe you lean more on the one that they are more familiar with or maybe they come to you to be wrong. So there's a lot of advanced cognitive modeling and parameters that could be in a full fleshed model because that's a super complex scenario, especially in a group and all of these, you know, relationships on relationships."
"Unknown","01;23;34;02","01;24;03;27","And we don't need to have that whole generative process model to have a generative model of policy that can be effective at foraging in that space. So it is a project and making that map is helpful for it. But to make policy decisions in the cognitive space isn't the same as describing and mastering all the variables of the cognitive process."
"Unknown","01;24;05;08","01;24;52;17","And so this mental foraging and physical foraging and also what we talked about with a sensory motor detached it helps make that really clear so like how does active inference model relevant experts use whether domain expertize or discipline, like a set of affordances A versus a whole different set of affordances, you know, maybe or expertize like in language learning example or some other example where it's not simply about like providing some advanced example and then having people asymptotes at that."
"Unknown","01;24;53;06","01;25;51;28","It's about opening the space for figuring out in that setting I think you can find a structural adaptation and mimicking an expert and that that typically sort of plays itself out as instructional design. I think you can find yourself also modifying unique and adapting in that way and then being able to go back and have an expert look at what you've done and the reason why they're an expert in that particular cases and because you're going to mimic them, but because you're going to ask them what they how the process that they used to arrive at where they have a certain subject confidence they're able to now diagnose where you're where your confidence is might"
"Unknown","01;25;52;09","01;26;28;17","exist and where you might want to you might want to reexamine what the probabilities and preferences were that got you to to the conclusions that you drew. So again, you're going to adapt either way. But I think that the path that you choose matters and knowing which path that you chose also matters. So I adapted, right? I adapt because I'm now trained up to be able to find the blue dot or the blue ball in the that the sea of plastic balls."
"Unknown","01;26;28;17","01;27;01;28","Right. That that's one form of of adapting because I've never been in a ball pit before now. I found the one that I was looking for. But, but another person could go in there and be able to maybe do something else with that blue ball because they modified the frame and the mesh and that's that again, we we just want to make sure that we know that there's a difference so that when we are reintegrating them at some point in the future, we know how we got there."
"Unknown","01;27;02;16","01;27;51;19","That's how OK, I like the throwback to instructional ism and interaction ism. It's an example was like latently there when talking about that niche dependance and the co-creation. So all these kind of terms, digital stigma when working online, for example, become implicit, when we're using a given sequence to be talking about like a certain thing that we want to call our attention to, we call our attention to some example or to some relationship, and then that modifies our cognitive model so that we're thinking about things and doing things differently after."
"Unknown","01;27;52;05","01;28;20;27","And so it's kind of like quality of engagement rather than quantity because some people, by reading a little change a lot and vice versa, they set up the relationship. I think it's funny that you bring up reading. So like for a very long time, my, my Ph.D. advisor never read anything like since he would never read anything. Did you read that?"
"Unknown","01;28;20;28","01;28;40;02","Like she just she doesn't like speed read. She reads, right? Which means like she looked at every third word and there's eight. And then like when she really sits down to read it, she's got all these things to say about it and wants to like wordsmith every sentence. And it's like we've had a lot of fun working together I don't, I don't mean to make that sound evil in any way."
"Unknown","01;28;40;02","01;29;02;28","But, but I mean, I don't speed read. I read fast, but I'm totally incapable of speed reading because I feel like I have to duplicate my efforts. Like if I skim it, like I can pick up some, you know, headings or whatever, but I never really got to read it. Like like I read something. I would have really read it like go through it line by line by line and look up things."
"Unknown","01;29;02;29","01;29;28;06","I don't know what they mean and this kind of thing. So it's it's a different and interesting approach how different people approach things in different ways. Yeah. Yeah. You know, talking about it in this paper, how we've been going between the sort of physiological and biological substrate of cognition and the nervous stem in the brain, all of that."
"Unknown","01;29;28;06","01;29;52;24","And then this more cognitive modeling approach which can be sort of cut and dry or overly computational or so-called unrealistic with respect to biological foundations. It's kind of like what Dean point to with like the bifurcation. And so now things are kind of coming together not in the way that everyone might have expected, but at least in a way."
"Unknown","01;29;53;08","01;30;24;21","And so that's a very interesting space and then like Blue, with the fast and slow reading, it's almost like there are multi scale dynamics associated with attention that can be measured with the EEG, but it's a hidden state what is actually happening in the mind and brain. But those are the kinds of experiments that people use and there's some rhythms like the fast cycles, like Gamma that are playing out like kind of like the speed of perception and awareness of like words."
"Unknown","01;30;25;08","01;31;04;00","And then there's also slower like symbolic or semantic changes and all these different time scales. And it's just like making the space to let the connections and the terms and the implications resonate and connect with the learner. And the creator is like a lot more valuable than any amount of coefficient of low reading and so how to balance the information amount and type and sequence and all of these things."
"Unknown","01;31;04;25","01;31;35;12","With holding the space for just the slower transformative process. And that's basically you yeah. So that's huge, Daniel, because I think a lot of people that get into the instructional ism, you'll hear the expression, and I'm not overgeneralizing here, you'll hear Well, we're going to break this down as opposed to the interaction ism, which is we're going to slow this down there's a, there's a, there's quite a difference."
"Unknown","01;31;35;15","01;32;09;14","Yeah. Those two things open up and slow down or we're going to drill down. Finish it out get it done in the time. And as we discuss like this is the archetypes of the dialectic. It's not like we're only taking one approach or another, but it's very easy to see how the range in at least education space, not even thinking of other areas is like it's the amount of content and then it projects down into how it's delivered and then content gets slaughtered in or out or things get expanded or not."
"Unknown","01;32;09;14","01;32;29;08","Or the, you know, Monday's class gets canceled and it moves to Tuesday so that's like the sort of instruction projection approach, which is so different in multiple ways, especially in how it's applied to thinking more about the opening up of space and slowing down and the learners journey and all that."
"Unknown","01;32;31;13","01;32;52;28","And when you're in the huddle and you're and you're calling out the shorthand before you actually line up at the scrimmage line and snap the football it's interesting what you point out, Blue Eye. In my history, I was always prepared to slow down when it was math and the symbology like I have no problem slowing down for that."
"Unknown","01;32;53;10","01;33;25;11","But trying to read out long sentences is just about kills me. I mean, my A.D.D., I can't, I have to interleave like every, every 20 to 30 minutes because if I don't, my skin starts to crawl. So I mean, those sort of contextual factors that are literally weighing on you, you don't know those sorts of things. And if you're an expert who's just trying to push out all this information in a 13 week window, I'm not really sure whether or not you can sort of get down to that level of personalization."
"Unknown","01;33;25;11","01;33;46;11","But if you're, if you're able to, it makes all the difference in the world in terms of what people take away from, from the exposure. Right. I find it way easier to do the shorthand thing. I, you know, if a picture is worth a thousand words, I I'm, I'm in full agreement with that. I just can't do the thousand word thing."
"Unknown","01;33;47;03","01;34;23;23","So yeah, yeah. Really interesting. And Stephen wrote in the chat, good to see these questions about active modeling expertize being thought of in different ways, like the direction of travel, the distance to travel, the rate of travel, mode of transport, yeah. Thanks for sharing it, Steven. Landscapes and sort of the sense making and the wayfinding and being on this cognitive landscape versus or, and being on this spatial foraging landscape."
"Unknown","01;34;23;23","01;34;51;00","So going out for the mushroom forage with someone who's familiar with mushrooms and somebody else who's familiar with the biochemistry but hasn't seen the mushroom in the ground, and then someone else who's on a different perspective because of their background or people with different physical abilities and knowledge in the spatial setting. And then there's the cognitive foraging and then just like is it that the colony forges as a unit?"
"Unknown","01;34;52;01","01;35;21;27","And then that's the sort of flip side of the nest. Mates forage collectively and so the team forges as a unit collectively, and the individual is sort of engaged at this level that we have experience in the policy selection relevant to our participation in some either niche or team or project let's go back to the paper, see if there's any other pieces like that."
"Unknown","01;35;21;27","01;35;52;29","We could kind of look at let's look at the roadmap interest. We talk a bit about can we talk a bit about the endowment part of this because we haven't really that well, just the endowment, what's the endowment? So the point is essentially that now that we've built this this base, a stable platform, what what can we do with it?"
"Unknown","01;35;52;29","01;36;21;29","Like what leverage have we now potentially achieved? So what's the endowment here in terms of what the what the paper really what's the new affordances that we didn't have before we did that we didn't maybe necessarily have explicated quite so clearly prior to reading the paper. Maybe that's one I don't want to put pressure on. But what do you think blew so I'm trying to remember, maybe you guys can remind me in this figure."
"Unknown","01;36;21;29","01;36;50;22","Oh, wait, wait, wait. So now in with temporal depth it's got to be an obvious step, right? Is that correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because in having a homeostatic temporal depth, like, is it possible right? Or like, isn't like they just can, they can only do and I wonder if that's like, you know, a single celled organism can only, like, do at that moment, like they're not planning for it to get cold later or something like that."
"Unknown","01;36;52;21","01;37;30;06","Then really the so I wonder if it's not only temporal depth but any kind of relationship if I wonder if it's not necessarily temporal depth if time is flat. Right. I mean, I guess in order to modify your own behavior or thought you would have to have some temporal depth. But this Alice static idea is interesting with respect to my relationship to my future self or my relationship to my previous self or my relationship to other people in my community or whatever."
"Unknown","01;37;30;21","01;38;11;12","I'm so I just wonder about if that's why this is the outset and not the homeostatic or like can you endow homeostatic temporal depth and get that same kind of ability for perspective and retrospective inference? Like you can't, but why not? Like, maybe let's let's put some words to that. Some of the favorite nice I would say homeostatic function could be in a model with memory or anticipation, like the thermometer could record the last 100 time points or it could have a prediction for the next hundred."
"Unknown","01;38;11;26","01;38;39;28","But the function would be that it only turns on the heating once it gets too cold. So it still is the on the action selection side, it still is making a one Markov chain decision based upon an instantaneous measurement. And so it can be implemented whether just for a computational parsimony or in a simple biological system with just one timestamp."
"Unknown","01;38;40;12","01;39;09;22","If it's this hot, then turn on the cooling. And so it's the ultimate if then because it's like a threshold model. And so it gets pared down over evolutionary time. But then you're bringing up like to even engage with a counterfactual or some influence of something on future policy. There has to be like a depth and then this gets back to whether it's modeling the thing itself, like what do these represent?"
"Unknown","01;39;09;22","01;40;00;00","Are they the scientists testing a model of one, two, three or four, five, our temporal depth for the forager or is this the foragers, quote, cognitive model as if that were somehow not model based science? Or is it the neuro architecture or the functional anatomy of the forager there's a lot of ways it could lean or be framed I think in a complimentary way, but one will have to be really careful where support for one domain super valid and where one not like if it were a circuit board without topology, then it seems like pretty good to go to use that as a pretty broad descriptor of a system."
"Unknown","01;40;00;13","01;40;22;02","Whereas if this was a simplification of memory and there was an uncertainty parameter labels uncertainty or anxiety like we discussed a little earlier, someone slaps a parameter on one of these edges and starts addressing complex real world settings. How does that exactly work?"
"Unknown","01;40;27;04","01;40;51;29","So one of the things that I think that it endows us with is that the, the homeless that we have status as the sort of the basic the basic pattern. There's a there's a partition between the epsilon and the MU. So the first thing that they did is they created a sort of horizontal partition. And then when they went to the parallelism, now there's two epsilons and two moves."
"Unknown","01;40;52;10","01;41;38;21","And so now they added the vertical partition as well. And I think that's really, really helpful in terms of at the basic level of the statistical we talked last time that you have to kind of be a polymath. But I think from from a modeling perspective, it's getting that orthogonal mesh established that moves us up the chain of complexity because then all of a sudden you can have diagonal dependencies and then you can actually add the, the, the Z plane going through this in terms of how the scale is built out on both distance and time so I think that's one of the endowments that it provides I could just restate that."
"Unknown","01;41;38;21","01;42;13;20","It's like when we say that one of the advantages potentially in application of active inference could be that models are composable, so they can be composed within a given scale like spatially or temporally. And that has a visual representation. It can also be composed in this nested way, which as we've explored several times, can represent physical enclosure or temporal enclosure as well as this cognitive architecture like mental action, depending on how different variables are interpreted in nested modeling."
"Unknown","01;42;14;13","01;42;48;04","And so it's composable in several dimensions of transformation which they represented in Figure four in a way where each transformative step, even though the function might change a lot from the beginning to the end, each organizational or structural architectural, cognitive step or morphological, if one is looking at that layer, can be mapped into a certain space and direction of movement within that space do you think it can also be sculpted?"
"Unknown","01;42;48;04","01;43;06;24","I don't mean because we're looking at this historically, we're looking at all the things that happened in the history. Was this the stuff that was kind of carved out? And so a lot of the stuff that doesn't matter removed in order for it to be more comprehensible because I agree with you, that can be composed. But I also think it's not decomposed."
"Unknown","01;43;06;25","01;43;34;11","But I do think or even deconstructed, I think it can be sculpted out of a greater history, a greater whole the so. Oh, yes, please. So sorry. Like what? You know, when you talk about a greater history and we talked about historicity in and today, like during the last few hours and we've also talked about memory. And there's a difference right?"
"Unknown","01;43;34;11","01;44;07;14","Like so so history history is like historically accurate. Yes. And that is like what I remember or like what any what any individual remembers. You know, we've talked about that before actually have few live streams ago. All I'm thinking is, is that what this does is compare all the things that what is it actual of constantly. It said how did how did he frame it so that we can understand why we're here now versus the all all the things that didn't make it right."
"Unknown","01;44;07;29","01;44;32;21","That's essentially what I'm talking about in terms of explaining right there, explaining why something got to the place that it did as opposed to the necessity of all the things you had to do, all the things you had to compose in order to realize the outcome. I'm trying to bring that back to a sculpting metaphor now. Awesome. So that's the axial constant."
"Unknown","01;44;32;21","01;45;11;12","20, 21 paper, the title was The Free Energy Principle. It's not about what it takes, it's about what took you there. And so that's definitely an evolutionary perspective and it's partially because of Axel's background and evolution and ecology, because that's what we can say about evolution. This is what got birds here right? And so the counterfactuals and evolution are a really interesting topic, and that's sort of explored in a variety of like more popular as well as more mathematical treatments, like how do we go from the observed, which must have existed?"
"Unknown","01;45;11;16","01;45;38;12","So it's very easy to fall to them being the best of all possible worlds, optimal form, et cetera. But then we also recognize the changing environments and interactions and all that. And then blue like with the history, historicity facts and the impacts which are like facts that aren't known. And then there's the memory which requires a perspective people could use system memory or something to refer to a factor, an impact on a system."
"Unknown","01;45;38;18","01;46;05;25","But these are just being used loosely, like some parts of how the past influences the present in the future have to do with systems that take a perspective. Other impacts are not through those adaptive active inference agents, and so that's very different. And so historicity is kind of like the stigma g pheromones layer and then there's like memory with the forager."
"Unknown","01;46;06;03","01;46;37;29","So you could talk about the memory of the ground for the ferryman, but it makes sense to just remember that it's a different thing with a fair amount on the ground than the cognitive inference. And Don't Ask Me is going to have all the knowledge or the on board modeling to make decisions save for the ones that not to complicate it too much, but it's stuck in the dialectic between doing exactly what worked in the past, which is to say recently succeeded but might not work in the future."
"Unknown","01;46;38;10","01;47;22;06","And changing things. But once you move into changing things, the space of the adjacency of changing is sometimes like daunting. And you still haven't really addressed the problem of changing world. So origins very deep entry point like into a lot of these questions in active inference and in other areas because it really connects to the egocentric, hopefully not in the solipsistic or narcissistic sense, but just in the wayfinding sense making paradigm that actually accommodates for others through modeling them explicitly and prioritizing the environment and things like that."
"Unknown","01;47;22;29","01;47;55;06","So pretty cool. And this paper, just to kind of restate what they brought to the picture, they looked at evolutionary time scales and they framed cognition as structural change, which in a Bayesian modeling framework is sometimes called structural learning as opposed to like parameter learning, fine tuning, given the model structure, and they connected that to the Bayesian graph model of the active inference partitioning."
"Unknown","01;47;56;03","01;48;28;00","And then connected that to the factor graphs. And then using the homeostatic example talks about how there could be like elaborations into other structures from structures to each other that might be enabling the rise of phenotypes or enabling the modeling of phenotypes that are interesting OK, any final thoughts are like, where does this paper take us? What is different now?"
"Unknown","01;48;28;00","01;48;30;04","What are we going to be talking about soon?"
"Unknown","01;48;33;02","01;48;55;07","So I'm excited to really delve into the math that is going to get behind the models that were elucidated out in figure or how do we go through time and the relationality and hierarchical dimensions and so forth?"
"Unknown","01;48;59;06","01;49;27;12","OK, thank you, Blu Dean. You won't have the last word, but what do you think well, I'm still trying to figure out how this sort of ties in with the whole identity piece. I love that because I thought that was just a rabbit hole that went way too far and too deep. But I know that when you do get that parallelism and when you can sort of create dimensional grid that has a negative space as well."
"Unknown","01;49;27;15","01;50;07;07","So like you can be as units going positively or negatively and passing through zero and how that fits with identity, that's that's sort of an that's a kind of a personal thing that I got to do. And then the other thing that I really thought was the thing that I really liked about this paper is that I think it took something that's really, as you said, over over huge time scales and sort of took it took it back down to something that that might be digestible for a lot of people that otherwise they kind of go, OK, so here's a hundred thousand years ago or a million years ago, or whatever from the bacteria to now, what what"
"Unknown","01;50;07;27","01;50;46;12","what are the sort of basic building blocks that we say might have might have played a part in getting to the kind of sophistication where we are now? And again, I think it's about learning. I always think that evolution is about learning. And so as I said in the point, once this this affirmed a lot of the stuff that I think we need to be bringing into some of the more formal ways that we structure learning, because I think it is I think it's learning sort of unleashed as opposed to all tied up Awesome."
"Unknown","01;50;47;08","01;51;12;24","Thanks both and everybody who is helping in all the ways for the previous videos. Just some last thoughts would be like from both of you and hopefully all together. There's really some interesting insights into learning and education for active inference learning, which is kind of like our meta regime of attention in Active Inference Lab when we're in that regime of attention."
"Unknown","01;51;12;24","01;51;47;08","But many people have other regimes of attention where it would certainly apply to bring some of these methods and ideas in and also bring pieces from outside into our cognitive modeling of attention and collaboration and communication like those topics and how those are the pillars of education and research during a time when education and research and participation are evolving is some of the most interesting things."
"Unknown","01;51;47;08","01;52;20;19","And so to be able to read evolutionary papers that take a cool scope and approach and then connect it to how we're hopefully organizing together and including the Affordance to participate with anyone who's listening now it's an interesting mixture. So I hope that we all can just keep on learning and applying together all right, this. Thanks, guys. Thanks again by."
