00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,680
38.0 february 10th 2022.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
we're going to be discussing the paper

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
the evolution of brain architectures for

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
predictive coding and active inference

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
welcome to the active inference lab we

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
are a participatory online lab that is

11
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
at some of the links here on the slide

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,199
this is recorded in an archive live

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,800
stream so please provide us with

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,520
feedback so we can improve on our work

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
welcome here and we'll be following good

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
video etiquette for live streams it's

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
going to be a solo stream though

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
go to activeinference.org if you want to

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
learn more about how to participate or

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
contribute or get involved with any

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
actinflab project and check out this

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200

streams

27
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,720
the page looks like this so you can see

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
events that haven't happened yet like 39

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
40.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
and then also you can look back and you

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
can see who is participating and read

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
the papers and all of that

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,799
so

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,079
check it out

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
today in active stream

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,119
number 38 the goal is to learn and

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
discuss this cool paper the evolution of

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
brain architectures for predictive

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
coding and active inference

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,320
the papers by giovanni pizzulo thomas

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,159
parr and carl firsten from december 2021

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
and just like all videos

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
it's just an introduction to some of the

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
ideas it's not a review or a final word

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600
so go check out the paper to learn more

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
and there's going to be an overview with

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
first names and claims abstract and

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
roadmap

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,040
all right i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,120
california

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
the big question that this paper is

52
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,959
getting at is

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,160
what is the evolutionary

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,840
neurophysiological basis of cognition

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,319
and how do complex cognitive phenotypes

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,440
arise

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
so how do things

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
develop and evolve

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
how they think and how does that change

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
over evolutionary time

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
and shown here are three images

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,239
representing three scales of analysis of

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,840
looking at ant cognition so on the left

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,319
is a representation of the synapse with

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
the glia wrapped around it and the

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
molecules and some of the mechanisms

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
because changes in those mechanisms can

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
influence cognition

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
then in the middle is a 3d

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,640
representation of an amp brain with the

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
different brain regions like the central

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
complex and the

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
optic and the olfactory lobes

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
and this represents the level of

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
regional or

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,480
micro or

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,599
mesoanatomical variation and that

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
definitely changes over evolutionary

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
time just like the synaptic level

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
and then there's this behavioral

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
ecological level and that's where the

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
ants are engaging in collective behavior

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
and stigmargy and so

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
how's this how does this all work

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
how does this all work in today's ants

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
and how has it evolved and then expand

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,519
that to other species and other

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
questions

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
the paper was published right at the end

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
of 2021 in december

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,480
in

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
the

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
royal society of publishing

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,480
and just to go over the aims and claims

95
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,519
of the paper

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,760
this is in the author's words

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
there's growing consensus that the

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
brains of humans and other

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
phylogenetically derived or advanced

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
organisms operate in a predictive manner

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
across perception

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
predictive coding and action control

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
active inference

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
yet the ways in which our advanced

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
predictive abilities may have arisen

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,399
during evolution remain unclear

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
the goal of this article is to sketch an

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,918
evolutionary history of brain

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
architectures for predictive processing

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
a central tenet of our proposal is that

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,240
although prediction is often

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
characterized as a complex cognitive

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
function it is not a late evolutionary

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
addition of advanced animals like us

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
rather

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
in distinction to a late-stage cognitive

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
argument like saying language is what

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
makes us an advanced cognizer

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
or semantic language with

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
certain types of syntax rather our

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
complex predictive abilities eg planning

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
and imagination

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
emerged gradually e.g via phyletic

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
gradualism

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
smooth changes through evolutionary time

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,080
or punctuated equilibrium

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
sharp changes through evolutionary time

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
but

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
punctuated at one scale is smooth at

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
another from simpler predictive and

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
error correction loops

132
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,160
eg motor and autonomic reflexes

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
that were already part of the brains of

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
our earlier evolutionary ancestors and

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
were key to solving adaptive regulation

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,759
problems

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
so just like

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
mike levin's paper was addressing the

139
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
question of basal cognition from the

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
bioelectric perspective here is going to

141
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,080
be more of a predictive processing and

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
action inference perspective on the

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
functional aspects not on the

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,639
mechanistic so the bioelectric was down

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
here at the level of cells

146
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
this is going to be approaching it from

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
a little bit of a different perspective

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
but we'll find out

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
here's the abstract

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
this article considers the evolution of

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
brain architectures for predictive

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
processing we argue that brain

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
mechanisms for predictive

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
perception and action are not late

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
evolutionary editions of advanced

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
creatures like us

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
rather they emerge gradually from

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
simpler predictive loops for example

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
autonomic and motor reflexes that were a

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
legacy from our earlier

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
evolutionary ancestors

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,639
and were key to solving their

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,560
fundamental problems of adaptive

164
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
regulation

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
we characterize simpler to more complex

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
brains formally in terms of generative

167
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
models that include predictive loops of

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
increasing hierarchical breadth and

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
depth

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,600
these may start from a simple

171
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
homeostatic motif and be elaborated

172
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,880
during evolution in four main ways these

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
include the multimodal expansion of

174
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
predictive control into an allostatic

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
loop

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
its duplication to form multiple sensory

177
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
motor loops that expand an animal's

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,319
behavioral repertoire

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
and the gradual endowment of general

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
generative models

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
with hierarchical depth to deal with

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
aspects of the world that unfold at

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
different spatial scales and temporal

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
depth to select which plans

185
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,199
select plans in a future oriented manner

186
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,360
in turn these elaborations underwrite

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the solution to biological regulation

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,639
problems faced by increasingly

189
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
sophisticated animals

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,039
our proposal aligns neuroscientific

191
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,280
theorizing about predictive processing

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
with evolutionary and comparative data

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
on brain architectures in different

194
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
animal species and just looking ahead

195
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,479
here's a figure that we're going to get

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,520
to

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
here's the ancestral state it has this

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
structure it's a model

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
and then it's going to undergo a set of

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
different types of discrete operations

201
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
that change it structurally and that's

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
structure learning and it's going to

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,639
happen over evolutionary time scale and

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,400
it's going to be tied to functional

205
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
architectures for predictive processing

206
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
okay how do they go from here to there

207
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
this is the roadmap

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
after the introduction they introduce

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
predictive regulation and control

210
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
perception cognition and control action

211
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
as basic design principles of the brain

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
so kind of taking that embodied approach

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
but making it very operational and

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
functional so that it can be studied

215
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,720
from an evolutionary function

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
perspective

217
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
introducing the brain

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,759
as doing structure learning in

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
generative models over evolutionary and

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
also other time skills

221
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,000
they then give three examples of

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
simple predictive motifs in ancestral

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
brains which is the homeostatic control

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
the allostatic control and the simple

225
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,199
simple behavioral learning

226
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
then they introduce that figure that we

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
just looked at and that's the

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,360
evolutionary algebra of structure

229
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
learning just like you can multiply and

230
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,479
add these are kind of like operations on

231
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
evolutionary spaces

232
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,159
they then discuss a few finer points

233
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,080
related to behavioral switching temporal

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,959
depth hierarchical depth and then take a

235
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
phylogenetic perspective at the end

236
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
giving an example and there's a

237
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
discussion

238
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
okay

239
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,040
so

240
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
to go into section two and just sort of

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
deal with the keywords and themes as

242
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
they

243
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
are needed

244
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
here's figure one

245
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
uh in figure one the reason why we can

246
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
even jump in here without going to any

247
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
keywords is

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,279
it's

249
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
biology we're talking about and we can

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
jump in why not as good of a place as

251
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
any to go in at the action perception

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
loop and then connect it to some of the

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
analytical or mathematical formalisms of

254
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
active inference and the free energy

255
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
principle so this is figure one in the

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
paper in section two

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
the action perception cycle and

258
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
predictive regulation

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
so here's our entity our agent on the

260
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,000
left

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,279
and here is our world state on the right

262
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,640
the entity is engaged in prediction

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
while they're making observations that

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
are being emitted from the world that's

265
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
resulting in some discrepancy either

266
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
things are exactly as expected or not so

267
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
an example would be in the visual field

268
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
the brain is generating a prediction of

269
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,640
what is in the blind spot of the retina

270
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
and then if the eyes were to move there

271
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
to use action

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
changing the world in terms of the

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
stimuli coming in

274
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
through ocular motor action

275
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,680
that would result in a different

276
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
perception that could either confirm or

277
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
deny confirm

278
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
with a low discrepancy or

279
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
be very surprising with a high

280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
discrepancy

281
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
what was expected about what was in the

282
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
blind spot which would confirm accuracy

283
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
in a visual model

284
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,360
so

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
in this partitioning of action and

286
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
perception which is just very

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
descriptive it's not quite the bayesian

288
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
graph that we're going to get to later

289
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,880
it's kind of like a flow model and

290
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
there's probably other flow models that

291
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,640
could be used as well but it turns out

292
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
that this partitioning or this way of

293
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
thinking about flow at least

294
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
conceptually

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
leads to in the active inference

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
proposal

297
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,360
this

298
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
idea of using

299
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
a free energy minimizing function over

300
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
some math that will get to a little bit

301
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
more formally in the next figure and

302
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
using a kind of combined metric that has

303
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
two parts the red and the blue

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,640
to make

305
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
decisions about

306
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
perception as well as action because it

307
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
turns out that perception and action and

308
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
cognition and metacognition are all part

309
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
of the entities model that it's doing

310
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
inference on in certain cases

311
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
so just to kind of throw back to

312
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
not so long ago

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,839
here we have the f

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,040
of q

315
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
that's the distribution that's under the

316
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,920
entity's control and y and so it's as a

317
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
function of beliefs and data there's

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
going to be some term

319
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,880
and so just looking back to 37

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
we looked at the variational free energy

321
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,160
and how that relates to perceptual

322
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
inference

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
where

324
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
there's a penalty for overfitting

325
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
as well as a penalty for failing to

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
explain the data so it's kind of making

327
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
a visual model

328
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
or a perceptual model that in that

329
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
snapshot given the priors and precision

330
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
and all of that

331
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
is not overfitting but it is fitting the

332
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
data and it's kind of existing on that

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,079
frontier and then it's using variational

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,839
inference to solve that in a really

335
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,279
tractable way

336
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,240
and then when action comes into play a

337
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
few things happen first the agent has to

338
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
incorporate their own preferences

339
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
because why care about action if you

340
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
don't even care why it's going to happen

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,839
so they have to incorporate their

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,160
preferences which is a non non-arbitrary

343
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,040
in a sense for action selection but it's

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,320
arbitrary in a higher level

345
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
as well as incorporating the fact that

346
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,399
there's uncertainty over the

347
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
consequences of action or just future

348
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
states of the world not just like sensor

349
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,720
measurement as in other cases so we have

350
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
to take this variational free energy

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
calculation that was just like snapshot

352
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
perception and expand it a little bit to

353
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
the expected free energy so here's f in

354
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
the background and now there's this

355
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
expected free energy term g

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
which is over

357
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
also an action selection policy z

358
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
and now there's kind of similar like

359
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,480
resonating or rhyming terms

360
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
but rather than over fitting

361
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,839
the imperative on the left side is to

362
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
satisfy preferences

363
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,079
on the right side the penalty for

364
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,920
failing to explain the data

365
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
is kind of transposed into this failing

366
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,079
to surprise or failing to minimize

367
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,800
expected surprise of future data so this

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
is like fitting the expectations well on

369
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
the right side in blue and then living

370
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
up to your preferences and expectations

371
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
in an optimistic way on the left so it's

372
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
kind of like realism on the right and

373
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
optimism on the left

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
and

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
that is what we talked about in 37 and

376
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
that's the partitioning that's being

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
done basically here

378
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
the authors are setting that up as the

379
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
action perception cycle and predictive

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
regulation just wanted to kind of view

381
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,600
37 really quick because it was a fun

382
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
discussion that we had

383
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
it also really sets the stage for how is

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,959
that similar or different than other

385
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
action perception partitionings or

386
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
models does evolutionary psychology or

387
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
evolutionary cognitive studies do they

388
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
have

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
a fundamental action perception model

390
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
at the root

391
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,079
is that a good thing is it a bad thing

392
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
section three goes into section two

393
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
again was just about how this single

394
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
slide and represented in figure one

395
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
about this predictive

396
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
so anticipatory but also embedded etc

397
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,839
infinity loop

398
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,199
cycle

399
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,199
is the basic principle of the brain we

400
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,639
can't take the basic principle of the

401
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,360
brain to be um some lower level like

402
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
just information transmission amongst

403
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,639
cells

404
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,399
nor do the authors jump in at a higher

405
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
level like the fundamental unit of

406
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,399
cognition is linguistic tokens that are

407
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,360
being modified not discrepancies with

408
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
multiple different kinds of things that

409
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
are being predicted

410
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
from this functional description of

411
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,880
cognition

412
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
they move to section three formulas

413
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
formalizing brain design as structured

414
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
learning in generative models

415
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,639
so what is the structure of this model

416
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,240
and then what does it look like to do

417
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,680
structure learning

418
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
in that model

419
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,440
and why is it generative

420
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
and then how is that formalized

421
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,079
so

422
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
here's figure two the generative model

423
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
and the generative process so the first

424
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
words the same second words different so

425
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
they're different words

426
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,639
and the figure on the left side has the

427
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,639
entity the figure on the right side has

428
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,720
the world state so it's the same action

429
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
perception loop we saw in figure one and

430
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
now this sort of conceptual flow

431
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
single edge model like just only one

432
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,839
arrow here no extra anything just sort

433
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,560
of

434
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,160
first pass

435
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
it's compatible with this which is

436
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,560
actually a bayesian graph but how do

437
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,759
they describe it and what are all the

438
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,880
variables

439
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
we still have the same things happening

440
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
we have the observations coming in to

441
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
the cognizing entity that's the

442
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
observations coming in

443
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
the entity is going to infer some action

444
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
policy

445
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
based upon the observations coming in

446
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
which is going to result in some change

447
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,519
to the actual underlying system which is

448
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
the generative process so that's like

449
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
the actual

450
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
birds and the beasts and the sun and

451
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,839
stuff

452
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,519
allegedly

453
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,839
it does get into a little bit of a gray

454
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,600
area with the realism instrumentalism

455
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
and the structural realism but we're not

456
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
even gonna go there in this discussion

457
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
right now the generative process is the

458
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
one that's handing out the observations

459
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
as modeled

460
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
the generative model to close the loop

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,199
is the entity's inference

462
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,160
and so here is x the entity's prediction

463
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
on hidden state and then here is x star

464
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
which is like the actual hidden state

465
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
that is being alleged in the world

466
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
and we've had some other discussions

467
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
about how that's the sigma function

468
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
that's like mapping between the two x's

469
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
that's what's being

470
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,599
minimized if the discrepancy is low

471
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
there's other notation

472
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
how do the authors describe it

473
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,679
the difference between the generative

474
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,959
model and the generative process

475
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
nodes correspond to probability

476
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
distributions and edges to their

477
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
statistical dependencies so this is like

478
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,079
a bayes graph

479
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
mathematically a generative model may be

480
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,160
formulated as the joint probability

481
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
density

482
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
p

483
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,679
of y and x of observations y and hidden

484
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,200
states x of the world that generate

485
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
those observations i think it was just a

486
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
copy error

487
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
the latter are referred to as hidden or

488
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,280
latent states as they cannot be observed

489
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
directly

490
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
the joint probability distribution can

491
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
be decomposed in two parts the first is

492
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
a prior p of x which denotes the

493
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,559
organism's knowledge about hidden states

494
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,160
of the world prior to seeing sensory

495
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
data

496
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,679
the second is the likelihood p of y

497
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,919
given x which denotes the organism's

498
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,280
knowledge of how observations are

499
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
generated from states so that's the

500
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,600
perceptual model

501
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
and then they go on to describe how

502
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
there's a difference between the

503
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,400
entity's inference on hidden state and

504
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
the actual hidden state which is the

505
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,120
generative process versus the generative

506
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
model distinction and then they

507
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,480
introduce action

508
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,120
and say action u that's this node that

509
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,679
influences the hidden state even if zero

510
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,640
effect

511
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
is generated based upon the inferences

512
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,200
made under a generative model

513
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,280
action is shown here as part of the

514
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
generative model

515
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
oh sorry

516
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
action is shown here as part of the

517
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,039
generative process

518
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,120
making changes to the world despite

519
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
being selected from the inference drawn

520
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,320
under the model so action is actually

521
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
making influence even again the edge

522
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
could be zero in some respect but it's

523
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
making actual influence in the world

524
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
it's like the active states interpreted

525
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
in this statistical way

526
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
so

527
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,200
what does that have to do um with

528
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
structure learning

529
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
so

530
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,799
the entity is going to either whether

531
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
you're realist and saying the entity is

532
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
doing structure learning or

533
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
you're instrumentalist

534
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,360
it is possible for us as researchers

535
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,000
today to model that entity as doing

536
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
structured learning because it's

537
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,480
computationally efficient or elucidative

538
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
or you go full utilitarian you just say

539
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
disregard that whole realism

540
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
instrumentalism it's a useful approach

541
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,559
and i'll follow utility wherever it goes

542
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
for any number of those reasons you

543
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,480
might want to model

544
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,640
the cognition of different entities

545
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,799
without going into just the philosophy

546
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
of what its cognitive process actually

547
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,679
is

548
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,200
and so one approach that's going to get

549
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
taken

550
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
is using

551
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,679
inference either from the outside

552
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,919
describing instrumentally or realism as

553
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,280
if it were happening maybe with

554
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,200
anatomical evidence

555
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,679
as if the hidden state could include not

556
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,360
just parameters that were continuous

557
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
about the world but also structures of

558
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,280
models

559
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
however it's difficult to imagine that

560
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,360
that type of cognitive or even extremely

561
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
metacognitive thought or action

562
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
selection

563
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,840
could happen for example in some early

564
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
however simple it may have been

565
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
and so how do we get from that flagella

566
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
changing bacterium

567
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,080
to

568
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
all the other kinds of cognition that we

569
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
see today

570
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
or should i say bacterium-like entity

571
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,399
relative or ancestor of today's bacteria

572
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
so how can we think about this model

573
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
which is often described in the context

574
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
of parameter learning and then approach

575
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,480
this as if it were

576
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
maybe about parameter learning sometimes

577
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
but also could be about structure in

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
terms of the good regulator and the

579
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
requisite diversity that kind of um

580
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
requisite variety those kinds of models

581
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
okay the next several sections are where

582
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
they get to the specifics and some of

583
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
the contributions of the paper that i

584
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,440
think will be really cool to

585
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
continue the discussion on

586
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,679
section four is just short and it's

587
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,280
saying we're about to go into three

588
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
examples of simple predictive motifs in

589
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
ancestral brains because one of the main

590
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
claims of the paper is that these motifs

591
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,200
are

592
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
very

593
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
ancestral they're old motifs they're not

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
johnny come lately to the cognitive

595
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
scene these are features that one can

596
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
think of as

597
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,640
who knows how far back or how simple

598
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
these cognitive mechanisms have existed

599
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
but we'll evaluate that maybe when we

600
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
get to talk together but first we'll

601
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,520
just kind of go through how they define

602
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
them and use them

603
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
the three predictive motifs are

604
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
homeostasis allostasis and simple

605
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
behavioral control so first five

606
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
generative models for the homeostatic

607
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,840
control of enteroceptive

608
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,200
variables they write

609
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
the generative models

610
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,039
shown in figure 3 which we'll look at

611
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,320
after this slide

612
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,520
afford the homeostatic

613
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,679
regulation of a single enteroceptive

614
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,720
variable

615
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
which we call here body temperature for

616
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
illustrative purposes

617
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
much like a thermostat this model

618
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,320
maintains the requisite body temperature

619
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
by reporting the discrepancy between

620
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,400
predicted and sensed thermoreceptor

621
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,960
activation given bayesian beliefs about

622
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
temperature triggering an autonomic

623
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
reflex u resulting in for example

624
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
vasodilation which resolves the

625
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,120
prediction error so if the life of the

626
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
organism were just to hang out on the

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,400
beach and vasodilate to off heat when it

628
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,120
needed to and then to constrict and to

629
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
save more heat when it needed to that's

630
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,600
the physiological task that this is

631
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
going to be describing

632
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
which is just one facet of an organism's

633
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
biology but there are experiments that

634
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,559
sometimes only measure temperature

635
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,799
and so thinking instrumentally

636
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
this single factor model

637
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
this single variable model on body

638
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
temperature may be sufficient for some

639
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
experiments or

640
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
it may be useful in certain cases so

641
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
just because it's a simple model doesn't

642
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
mean that it's not going to be very

643
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,320
educational

644
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
and provocative but also even be

645
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
sufficient in a lot of cases

646
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,120
but no one's even claiming it's realism

647
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
that's why it's written this way

648
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
they say see citation 20 for a fully

649
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
specified example and that is a citation

650
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
to

651
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,600
chance

652
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,039
at all in march 2022 so still in the

653
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
future

654
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
and they write we start from the

655
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
presence premise and this is in the

656
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,520
paper that again is from the future

657
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
we start from the premise that the goal

658
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
of enteroceptive control is to minimize

659
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
discrepancy between

660
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
expected and actual interroceptive

661
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
sensations i.e a prediction error

662
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
or free energy

663
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
importantly living organisms can achieve

664
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
this goal by using various forms of

665
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
enteroceptive control homeostatic

666
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,679
allostatic and gold directed

667
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,720
so

668
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039
there's more details in this paper

669
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,760
but

670
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
here in figure 3 is where they're going

671
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
to show it so keep in mind this

672
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
generative model structure

673
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,200
and now

674
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
these are going to be

675
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
in a different form

676
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,840
and here in the caption i'll describe

677
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,559
what they say

678
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,360
this is that homeostatic the first most

679
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,559
ancestral or just the simplest possible

680
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
just

681
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,360
go make it darker if it's too bright and

682
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
make it brighter if it's too dark make

683
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,960
it warmer if it's too cold make it

684
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
colder if it's too warm that kind of

685
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,279
first order cybernetic loop

686
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,360
this generative model includes an

687
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,240
enteroceptive thermoreceptor y

688
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
observations and a belief about body

689
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
temperature x

690
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
so that's the beliefs about how the body

691
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
should be and that's again

692
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
the beliefs playing that dual function

693
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,520
that the paper 37 drew out

694
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,799
which is that

695
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,200
on the left side of this equation

696
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
failure to satisfy the preferences

697
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,919
is dealing with this p distribution as a

698
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,960
preference

699
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,039
but then on the right side p has to do

700
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,720
with expectations that are being either

701
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,480
fit well or poorly

702
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
and so this is where active inference

703
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
has a slightly different architecture

704
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
perhaps than some other theories

705
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
the beliefs are about body temperature

706
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
it's not an estimate merely of the

707
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
external body temperature

708
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,279
crucially the prior over x is kept fixed

709
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
and hence it acts as a cybernetic set

710
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,679
point

711
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
well you can't just expect what's going

712
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
to be best for you you'll die right if

713
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
you die you die

714
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,960
but if you enact

715
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
policy such that your expectations are

716
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
realized then you persist that's why

717
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
we're studying things that are persist

718
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
ant

719
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,679
any discrepancy between the predicted

720
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,840
thermoreceptor activity given beliefs

721
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,240
about x and the measured y is registered

722
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
as a prediction error that is canceled

723
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
out by an autonomic response for example

724
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
a thermoregulatory response

725
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
this is shown as an illustrative plot of

726
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,520
the expectations of prior and posterior

727
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
observation and autonomic actions over

728
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,640
time so here is like the action policy

729
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
which is like be at the baseline level

730
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,279
of thermoregulation and then kick in

731
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,440
some sweating or um cooling mechanism

732
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,279
and then here it describes how the

733
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
observations start at about 37.1 and

734
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
then they steadily start climbing

735
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,320
and then the belief which is initially

736
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,200
like things should be 37.

737
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,159
the posterior the after evidence

738
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,120
estimate starts creeping up and then it

739
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
hits a certain value and it engages a

740
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
critical threshold that turns on this

741
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,039
thermoregulatory response and then that

742
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,960
cools the temperature back down

743
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,679
so

744
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
this is a basic architecture for doing

745
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
first order cybernetics and that kind of

746
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,600
first order logic

747
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
here in this figure the red circles

748
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
represent the expected values of x which

749
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,799
are used to make predictions about y

750
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
these are subtracted

751
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,039
red arrow with the rounded end

752
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,880
so this one

753
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
from the measured y to form a prediction

754
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,600
error dark blue circle epsilon

755
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
which is used to update the expectation

756
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,559
and drive action light blue circle you

757
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
here's you

758
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
that changes y

759
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,120
such that the prediction error is

760
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,480
resolved

761
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,159
what if it doesn't do it well then the

762
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,360
system dies

763
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
so we're talking about evolution where

764
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
we've had like for the ants 120 million

765
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
years allegedly for that to get pruned

766
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
out and even longer at the cellular

767
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
level

768
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,679
note the lateral modulatory connections

769
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
in the allostatic network which we'll

770
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,679
get to in a second so just to take one

771
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,279
little discourse

772
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,880
they say c24 for details what is pape24

773
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,919
it is fristen par and devry's 2017 the

774
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,919
graphical brain belief propagation and

775
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,360
active inference

776
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
let's just look at a few parts of this

777
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,399
awesome paper

778
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,480
so first they have a table with

779
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
definitions of the technical terms

780
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
so just to kind of read a few but it's

781
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
kind of awesome to see the authors do

782
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,360
this and this isn't great paper as well

783
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
so how do they define generative model

784
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,399
generative model or forward model

785
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,960
a probabilistic mapping from causes to

786
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
observed consequences data

787
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,840
so from hyperparameter

788
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
to the parameter

789
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,360
it is usually specified in terms of the

790
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,039
likelihood of getting some data given

791
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,440
their causes parameters of a model and

792
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
priors on the parameters so it's all

793
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,120
relative in nested models but this is

794
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,520
generating data like kind of cranking

795
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,159
out like a music box

796
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
possible or plausible data sets with

797
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,360
similar summary statistics like similar

798
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,039
mean and variance

799
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
of some distribution or similar

800
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,799
parameters if there's a whole vector

801
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,919
that describe it and then the

802
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,320
recognition model

803
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,200
is related to learning where new data

804
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
are coming in and discrepancy is being

805
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
minimized if the generative is

806
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,720
outputting the exact same mean and

807
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,799
variance that incoming data are having

808
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,640
the discrepancy is low

809
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,559
the predictions which are about

810
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
preferences are being realized

811
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,080
successfully action policy is working

812
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
well or better than expected

813
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
flip everything and you have the

814
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,200
opposite situation

815
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
and then just to give one more

816
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
definition here because the next slide

817
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
will feature it though the others are

818
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
also good to read

819
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
factor graph

820
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,960
a factor graph is a bipartite graph

821
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
where two distinct sets of nodes are

822
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,480
connected by edges

823
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
representing the factorization of a

824
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,399
function usually a probability

825
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,960
distribution function

826
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
formulating a bayesian network or model

827
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,039
as a factor graph enables the efficient

828
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,559
computation of marginal distributions

829
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,240
through the sum product

830
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,720
algorithm

831
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
what does a factor graph look like and

832
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
how does it relate to the kinds of

833
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,679
bayesian graphs that we've been looking

834
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,480
at

835
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
so on the top is not the base graph

836
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,000
that's distributed across this slide but

837
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,840
another variant that we've seen a bunch

838
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
of times which is the partially

839
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,960
observable markov decision process so g

840
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
expected free energy minimization

841
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,000
pi policy selection is influencing b

842
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,080
which is how s the latent state in the

843
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,640
world is changing through time there's d

844
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
the prior on the hidden state and then a

845
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
the mapping of how the state is related

846
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,880
to the observation

847
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
and so depending on how the model is

848
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,880
framed those can be learned or not but

849
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,360
it turns out that because of how this is

850
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
relatively sparsely connected within a

851
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
time frame

852
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,840
as well as across time frames there's a

853
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
way to use this bipartite construction

854
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,720
called a factor graph that splits up

855
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,519
those unlabeled edges which are

856
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,159
statistical dependencies and kind of

857
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,679
interweaves

858
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,600
functions which have a slightly

859
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
different representation and it turns

860
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,080
out that by interleaving these functions

861
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,760
into the variables

862
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,519
it's possible to

863
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,519
make what's called a factor graph and

864
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,000
that gives an order of operations to

865
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
arbitrary or within a certain set

866
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,159
any kind of base graph but it includes

867
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,679
this one importantly and so here is the

868
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,159
one two three time points and two

869
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,000
policies are being selected and that's

870
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,159
what this graph represents the organism

871
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,679
comes in with the prior

872
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,600
time step one two three there's two

873
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
actions

874
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
and then

875
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,559
here's another figure from the paper

876
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,760
where at each of those three time steps

877
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,080
one two and three a little bigger

878
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,360
at time steps one two and three

879
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,519
there's the

880
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,840
inference happening on time steps one

881
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
two and three so time step one that's

882
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
like anticipation and planning at time

883
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
step two it's like short term

884
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,039
anticipation as well as memory and time

885
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,519
step three it's like memory and it's

886
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,760
always now casting as well and so one

887
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
can imagine that this is a really useful

888
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,480
format because it's extremely composable

889
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
on one hand so just like they said okay

890
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,640
well we kind of have this motif for the

891
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
three time steps and the connectedness

892
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
what if d

893
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,799
from the top level

894
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,519
came down and was s at a lower level and

895
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,000
we've seen that taken to a really

896
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
elaborated extent as well as interpreted

897
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
in for example the paper on mental

898
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
action in live stream 25.

899
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,679
and so factor graphs are awesome because

900
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,039
they're

901
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,360
basically needing to only be specified

902
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
in the bayes graph format

903
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,399
but then it provides not just a mesh

904
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,159
connectivity but a process algorithm

905
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,240
and a heuristic an approach that's

906
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,919
actually tractable so we get the

907
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,240
composable analytical and graphical

908
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
component that's an attractable

909
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,039
algorithm

910
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
the next section is generative models

911
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,240
for the allostatic control of

912
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
enteroceptive variables so this is going

913
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,880
to be the first real modification of the

914
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
homeostat that's introduced in three

915
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,880
this is going to be the base case but it

916
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,799
could be something else other than body

917
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,159
temperature

918
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,880
the homeostat is simple but limited as

919
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,000
they write it can counter sensed changes

920
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,600
of body temperature but cannot

921
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
anticipate predictable changes of body

922
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,120
temperature or other variables

923
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,679
in nature

924
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,640
there are several regularities eg night

925
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
day or seasonal alternation that can be

926
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
easily incorporated to extend the above

927
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
generative model as technically speaking

928
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,159
empirical priors the obvious advantage

929
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,919
of predicting how our bodily and

930
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,560
enteroceptive variables will change

931
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
is being able to exert some anticipatory

932
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,679
or allostatic control and so this is

933
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,839
kind of getting into the second order or

934
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,199
anticipatory cybernetics also related to

935
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,320
rosen's

936
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
anticipatory ecology

937
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,280
so here's figure 3 c

938
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,159
in

939
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,560
a and b there was just the homeostat

940
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,239
returning us to a set point after

941
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,760
something got triggered

942
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,359
and now there's going to be the

943
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,960
affordance for anticipatory control

944
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,719
this generative model

945
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,040
sketched out with the same scheme

946
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
as the previous

947
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
slide

948
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
this generative model extends the

949
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,399
homeostat by including a second set of

950
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,480
exterceptive variables

951
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,199
that correspond to light intensity white

952
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,480
y2

953
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,040
and a belief about sunrise x2

954
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,440
that's the sun visual side on the right

955
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,680
furthermore like the visual system

956
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
and the left side still the temperature

957
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,359
and terraceptive system furthermore the

958
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,119
model includes a predictive relationship

959
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
between sunrise x2

960
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,880
and body temperature y this edge isn't

961
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,520
saying that the sun warms the body it's

962
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
saying that they're in this model

963
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
there's an edge reflecting a statistical

964
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,359
dependency and that's where there's the

965
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,040
degree of freedom with respect to the

966
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,839
realism and instrumentalism etc

967
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,320
in this way inferring a sunrise can

968
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
trigger the autonomic response u of

969
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,800
thermoregulation in an anticipatory

970
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
manner that is before the sunlight

971
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,599
actually increases body temperature

972
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
the upper part of a and c are bayesian

973
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,359
networks highlighting that y is

974
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,520
conditionally dependent upon x with the

975
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,000
directed arrow between the notes with

976
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
more than one x and y in the model for

977
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,640
the allostat

978
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
the lower parts show the form of

979
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,079
neuronal message passing that could be

980
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,320
used to solve these generative models

981
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,720
so the bayes graph is represented on the

982
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
top and then there's the message passing

983
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,200
with respect to the neural population

984
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,670
so that's kind of the second

985
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,720
[Music]

986
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,520
aspect of figure 3 which is just

987
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
bringing in multi-sensory integration or

988
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
even it could be like two pixels for

989
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,839
example with beliefs about each other or

990
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,680
something like that but that's what

991
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,079
allostasis is going to be enabled by is

992
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,640
just by this duplication of the column

993
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,000
and then this connection in a different

994
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,280
way

995
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
and then here's the third section of

996
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,800
four seven

997
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
generative models for simple behavioral

998
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,160
control and so they write

999
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,320
the homeostat and the allostat permit

1000
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
the control of simple forms of swimming

1001
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
locomotion reaching and other movements

1002
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
one biological example

1003
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
is provided by the zebrafish virtual

1004
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,400
reality study 30

1005
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
which identified the neuronal

1006
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,240
underpinnings of error correction during

1007
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
escape behavior in the animal's

1008
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
telecephalon to brain region an

1009
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
evolutionary conserved set of brain

1010
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,880
circuits involved in action selection in

1011
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
other vertebrates including mammals such

1012
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
as the corticobasal ganglia circuit

1013
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,000
so that's about the evolutionary

1014
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
homology of the brain region and then

1015
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,359
here's just some pictures from the paper

1016
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,400

zebrafish capable of generating future

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
reality so

1024
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,520
they did a learning task that involved

1025
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,280
the fish being able to differentiate a

1026
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
signal and then they studied the role of

1027
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,440
anticipation in that and the authors in

1028
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
this paper

1029
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
use that as an example

1030
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
maybe we could talk about that or other

1031
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
examples in

1032
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,280
the dot one and the dot two

1033
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,079
section eight

1034
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,359
here's where we get to the um

1035
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,000
very interesting

1036
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
operations that are going to bring this

1037
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,800
sort of descriptive model of different

1038
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,760
kinds of homeostatic allostatic and

1039
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,359
intermodal and then behavioral

1040
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,960
regulatory elements into the

1041
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,520
evolutionary context so

1042
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,839
our central argument is that evolution

1043
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,480
proceeded via gradual elaborations of

1044
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
the predictive motifs illustrated above

1045
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,599
under genetic constraints and

1046
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,200
opportunities

1047
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,359
and the selective pressure of novel

1048
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,200
problems to be solved

1049
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
such as the control of more

1050
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
sophisticated bodies in the presence of

1051
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
richer ecological niches eg when

1052
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
vertebrates began to establish life on

1053
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
land some 400 million years ago

1054
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,079
over excessive generations

1055
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,400
generative models can remain stable or

1056
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,359
be elaborated along four key dimensions

1057
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,839
strongly limiting the space of what is

1058
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,760
evolvable

1059
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,079
so what are the four kinds of dimensions

1060
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,200
that are going to be changed

1061
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,880
that is going to be

1062
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
discussed in terms of the changes that

1063
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
can happen to

1064
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,880
the specifics of the generative model

1065
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
we have introduced the first kind of

1066
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
elaboration

1067
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,680
from the unimodal homeostat to the

1068
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
multimodal allostat so they kind of

1069
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,839
secretly introduced this transformation

1070
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,000
between figure 3ab and figure 3c

1071
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,079
so that was secretly like one of the

1072
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,079
transformations

1073
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,320
a second kind of elaboration is the

1074
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
duplication of predictive motifs which

1075
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,320
enlarges the animal's behavioral

1076
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
repertoire

1077
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,200
the third and fourth dimensions equip

1078
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,119
the generative model with temporal and

1079
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,079
or hierarchical depth respectively

1080
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,079
these two expansions enable richer

1081
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,320
predictive motifs that endow a cognitive

1082
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,400
sophistication

1083
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
such as the possibility to plan or

1084
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,560
consider events that change on multiple

1085
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,680
time scales

1086
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,800
so it's the evolutionary algebra

1087
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,640
on structure learning

1088
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,480
because we're outputting a structure

1089
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,240
this graph g

1090
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
which is going to be like

1091
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,760
as if the species over evolutionary time

1092
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,359
is going to be implementing some graph

1093
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,680
in terms of the structure of its model

1094
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,800
like

1095
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,040
if there's a case where the ant is not

1096
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
integrating the polarization of light

1097
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,720
with the olfactory system

1098
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,000
and then there's some change in the

1099
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
model that actually integrates them and

1100
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,520
then some relationship is learned

1101
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
whatever that means from a realist or

1102
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,280
instrumentalist perspective

1103
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
and that is going to be like an

1104
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
evolutionary algebra so it's not going

1105
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,040
to be like

1106
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,480
2x minus 3x but it's going to be more

1107
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,079
like that than not because there's going

1108
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,359
to be operations and they're going to

1109
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,359
happen in order

1110
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,000
so here's figure 4 where they represent

1111
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,560
their evolutionary algebra figure four

1112
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,119
the five main dimensions of elaboration

1113
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
of generative models introduced in the

1114
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,680
paper

1115
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,079
so it was you know

1116
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,440
four dimensions then it's five

1117
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,880
dimensions there's evolution in 4d

1118
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
by jablonka and lamb

1119
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,520
that would have been good to add to

1120
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,200
um

1121
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
the five main dimensions of elaboration

1122
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,520
of generative models introduced in the

1123
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,160
paper illustrated as operations of an

1124
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,040
evolutionary algebra so here's the five

1125
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
operations and so we're starting with on

1126
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,160
the left side that homeostat that simple

1127
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,319
corrective calibrative first order

1128
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,319
cybernetic model

1129
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,000
either what the system is actually doing

1130
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,560
or model of

1131
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,920
then there's going to be five

1132
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,680
transformations that can happen and then

1133
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
it's showing there's a second round like

1134
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
once you go h you could go h t a

1135
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
i plus i or i

1136
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,359
so you have five discrete options at the

1137
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,839
first time step but one of them is no

1138
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,839
change so it's kind of like no change or

1139
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,160
four different layers of um excitement

1140
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,480
of the electron like for quanta but

1141
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,800
they're for discrete operations like a

1142
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,200
deletion or an insertion in genomics and

1143
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
then from there it's just the state for

1144
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,720
the next time step of the model and then

1145
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,000
something else happens so what are the

1146
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,119
operations

1147
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
the bottom is i which is the identity

1148
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
operation that leaves the generative

1149
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
model as is

1150
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,200
so that can be interpreted as like a

1151
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,920
non-mutation or just a conservative mode

1152
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,880
which is how most inheritance works

1153
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,839
then the second one is the duplication

1154
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,560
operation i plus i so it's like identity

1155
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,000
remains the same but then there's a

1156
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,920
duplication literally it's like a

1157
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
genomic duplication

1158
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,640
but

1159
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,480
in this functional space

1160
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
replicates existing predictive motifs to

1161
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,680
form parallel sensory motor loops

1162
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,480
a is the operation that was described in

1163
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,359
figure 3c the allostatic operation

1164
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,800
endows the generative model with

1165
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
horizontal predictive relations between

1166
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,359
different modalities and so the

1167
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,800
duplication would be like going from one

1168
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,240
sensilla one antenna to two antenna or

1169
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,319
from going from one photoreceptor to two

1170
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,079
photoreceptors but the actual

1171
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,079
architecture of the column

1172
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,000
of the photosensory transduction cascade

1173
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,319
would basically be computationally

1174
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,400
or statistically unchanged and then the

1175
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,640
allostat is actually bringing in this

1176
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
horizontal aspect it's not just two um

1177
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,720
duplicated systems next to each other

1178
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,640
now there's actually connections between

1179
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,119
them and of the possible kinds of

1180
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,040
connections across columns one of them

1181
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,920
is like this classic allostatic motif

1182
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,599
then there's the ones that we haven't

1183
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,680
gone into as much which are t

1184
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,079
the temporal depth operation extends the

1185
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,400
generative model with separate variables

1186
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,880
for past present and future states

1187
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,119
so it's kind of from a graphical

1188
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,800
perspective what we looked at in the

1189
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,319
difference between

1190
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,880
the first factor graph

1191
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
which did take action at three time

1192
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,240
steps through time three time steps

1193
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,160
like the thermostat does to the one that

1194
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,079
actually has either prospectively

1195
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,920
looking anticipation about future time

1196
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,640
steps or retrospectively looking memory

1197
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,079
but that's how the factor graph comes

1198
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,480
into play

1199
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,119
that's temporal depth

1200
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,640
then

1201
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,280
the hierarchical depth operation h

1202
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
extends the generative model with

1203
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,800
separate variables for states of affairs

1204
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,440
that change at different time scales

1205
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,359
faster time scales at the bottom levels

1206
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,880
and slower time scales at the higher

1207
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,359
levels hence modeling narratives such as

1208
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,040
music and language where nested time

1209
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,400
skills are relevant

1210
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,480
so to kind of split that idea of

1211
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,520
temporal depth into two pieces there's

1212
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,119
incrementing the number of steps you're

1213
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,440
looking in the model that's increasing

1214
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,160
the time horizon on policy selection and

1215
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,079
increasing the temporal depth within a

1216
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,319
level and then there's this notion of

1217
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,079
nesting

1218
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,520
levels within each other that's the

1219
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,359
nested generative model

1220
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,400
and therefore nested markov blanket

1221
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,119
discussion that we've been having

1222
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,400
and that

1223
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,319
is going to be connected to

1224
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,640
cognitive activities like narrative and

1225
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,200
the the reason why they're very similar

1226
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,160
is that the time scales can kind of blur

1227
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,480
into each other and so it's all about

1228
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,200
the model's structure as stated

1229
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,920
like this one is hierarchical

1230
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,839
and it has a depth of three it's a two

1231
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,760
layer model and it has a depth of three

1232
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
three time steps are included

1233
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
and it could be different if there was

1234
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
always looking to a head and always

1235
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,400
looking to in the back then the model in

1236
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,079
the computer would need like a minimum

1237
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,880
of you know five time steps but the

1238
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,880
entities model could still be restricted

1239
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,119
to s minus 2 s minus 1 and then s plus 1

1240
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,400
s plus 2.

1241
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,640
so

1242
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
um

1243
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,240
those are the two ways that it can

1244
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,319
expand in these two temporal and

1245
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,920
hierarchical ways which is to nest

1246
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,040
hierarchically or to become temporally

1247
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
deeper with a longer horizon given the

1248
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,720
nesting structure so these are all

1249
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,640
structural changes that's why there was

1250
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,400
the whole piece about structure learning

1251
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,200
because it's as if or actually like over

1252
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
evolutionary time there's the structure

1253
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
learning happen and then if we use this

1254
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,680
partitioning and bayes graph approach

1255
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,480
then

1256
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,599
hypothetically any kind of evolutionary

1257
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,440
starting point if we go back far enough

1258
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,319
and then

1259
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,680
final state if we have all the

1260
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,839
transitions could be modeled within like

1261
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,119
a native active inference framework

1262
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,560
section nine they're going to go into a

1263
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,319
little more detail about duplicating

1264
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,720
predictive motifs and enabling multiple

1265
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,760
behaviors

1266
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,960
so they write

1267
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,119
how does this um the writing on how does

1268
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,079
this duplication of the model

1269
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,800
um looking at it from the outside it's

1270
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,560
like as if they're acting as if there's

1271
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
two models looking at it from the

1272
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,520
realism and the inside it's kind of like

1273
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,359
thinking about the real duplication of a

1274
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,680
cognitive function that's functionalism

1275
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,240
or like even a neuroanatomical region

1276
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,760
like the earlier examples with the

1277
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,040
retinal cells and that's like an

1278
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
anatomical realism

1279
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,960
so generative models can expand by

1280
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,599
duplicating simple predictive motifs to

1281
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,960
form a larger repertoire of

1282
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,720
species-specific behaviors such as

1283
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
approach avoidance

1284
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
the control of the vibrasay

1285
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,319
and visually guided grasping classic

1286
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,640
the operator i plus i in figure 4

1287
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,400
illustrates a generative model in which

1288
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,079
the same predictive motifs are

1289
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,400
duplicated and specialized to form a

1290
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,160
behavior-based architecture composed of

1291
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,960
multiple parallel sensory motor loops so

1292
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,640
they're suggesting that because these

1293
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,720
are your affordances your operations in

1294
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,960
your evolutionary algebra you can go

1295
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
from this starting point it's kind of

1296
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,920
like go to lesser block starting point

1297
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,800
and then doing operations to it because

1298
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,400
you have the starting point and the

1299
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,960
operations to it it allows you to get to

1300
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
even relatively advanced um

1301
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,240
motifs like approach avoidance etc

1302
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,160
but a key piece is duplication because

1303
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,000
duplication of something without

1304
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,319
changing it is how you are able to

1305
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,520
build more land to experiment in so to

1306
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,520
speak build more space and um

1307
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,040
i copied some images from genetics

1308
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
specifically in the relationship of how

1309
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,119
gene duplication and divergence in the

1310
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,359
early evolution of vertebrates this

1311
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,400
paper

1312
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,559
um and there's a huge amount of genetics

1313
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,200
and genomics works on the duplication

1314
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,359
and divergence and the

1315
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:09,520
neo-functionalization the

1316
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,119
sub-functionalization

1317
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,960
because if you have like an enzyme or a

1318
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
essential gene a

1319
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,480
not to go into the whole gene thing

1320
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
totally another time though

1321
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,200
um

1322
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,640
you could have the function of the

1323
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,760
second copy in the genome be lost and

1324
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,440
then there is still like a continuous

1325
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,040
line of function so if you only needed

1326
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,480
one copy of a

1327
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,720
then this would be sufficient and then

1328
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,559
other times when you have a and it's

1329
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,640
dual functional like it binds to two

1330
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,760
different not exactly similar molecules

1331
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,200
then when there's a paralogy when

1332
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,119
there's this duplication it allows sub

1333
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,599
functionalization or new functions to

1334
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,640
arise so that's how people talk about it

1335
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,520
and link it to realism in genomics and

1336
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,040
this is kind of approaching that from a

1337
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,400
cognitive perspective

1338
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,119
um there's probably more to say but

1339
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,520
we'll talk more about the duplicating of

1340
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,760
predictive motifs so how is duplicating

1341
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,839
predictive motifs

1342
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,440
enabling of multiple behaviors

1343
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
okay they write from a structure

1344
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,760
learning perspective duplication is an

1345
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,839
efficient way of building generative

1346
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,000
models and that's what it's all about in

1347
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,280
the sense that the dynamics are

1348
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,960
conserved over different sensory motor

1349
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,079
domains

1350
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,480
this conservation is mathematically

1351
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,400
akin to factorizing probability

1352
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,559
distributions on the generative model

1353
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,079
that has been discussed in terms of

1354
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,240
modular architectures and functional

1355
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,400
segregation as a principle of functional

1356
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,559
brain architectures

1357
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,720
in bayesian statistics physics this kind

1358
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,040
of factorization is ubiquitous and known

1359
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,760
as a mean field approximation

1360
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,000
indeed the free energy bound on model

1361
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,079
evidence is defined in terms of a mean

1362
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,200
field approximation

1363
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
that affords an accurate and minimally

1364
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,400
complex explanation for sensory data

1365
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,839
and so what are some of these citations

1366
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,040
484

1367
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,920
modular architectures for factorization

1368
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,480
of probability distributions in the

1369
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,920
generative model

1370
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,119
par sageed and firsten 2020 entropy

1371
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,000
so here's kind of a cool figure

1372
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,880
nice graph

1373
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,200
and then there's the message passing

1374
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,160
and then

1375
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,880
citation 48 the mean field approximation

1376
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,640
what is it

1377
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,440
here's a paper from 2001

1378
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,160
and they wrote algorithms that must deal

1379
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,079
with complicated global functions of

1380
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,400
many variables often exploit the manner

1381
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,559
in which the given functions factor as a

1382
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,960
product of local interactions each of

1383
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,319
which depends on a subset of the

1384
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,359
variables

1385
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,760
such a factorization can be visualized

1386
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,119
with a bipartite graph

1387
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,240
that we call a factor graph

1388
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,119
dot dot a wide variety of algorithms

1389
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,200
developed in artificial intelligence

1390
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
signal processing

1391
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,240
and digital communications can be

1392
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,480
derived as specific instances of the sum

1393
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,359
product algorithm

1394
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,680
including the forward backward algorithm

1395
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,520
the viterbi algorithm the iterative

1396
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,720
turbo decoding algorithm pearl's 1988

1397
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,480
belief propagation algorithm for

1398
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,160
bayesian networks

1399
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,680
markov blankets

1400
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,240
the common filter and certain fast

1401
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,760
fourier transforms fft algorithms

1402
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,480
so

1403
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,280
it was 21 years ago when this was

1404
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,880
happening and now we're here

1405
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,280
okay section 10 endowing generative

1406
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,359
models with temporal depth supports

1407
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,240
prospective and retrospective inference

1408
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,359
so

1409
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,680
just like we looked at with that factor

1410
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,200
graph

1411
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,520
giving this operation

1412
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,000
over evolutionary time enables that

1413
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,160
factor graph to arise from something

1414
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,880
with the lower time horizon

1415
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,640
the generative models discussed so far

1416
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,079
only consider present states and

1417
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,599
observations however they can be

1418
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,280
expanded into temporally deep models

1419
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,960
whose variables explicitly represent

1420
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,680
future and past states and observations

1421
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,400
so this is what the operation looks like

1422
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,680
it takes x t and then at x

1423
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,440
t plus one or tau depending on how it's

1424
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,839
written and then now there's another

1425
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,520
time step appended to the end of this

1426
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,680
model either actually or as if

1427
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,599
here's something cool that they wrote

1428
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,200
they wrote various researchers have

1429
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,440
speculated that a major driving force

1430
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,040
for the development of deep temporal

1431
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,040
models was foraging so why would this

1432
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,839
happen functionally which is to say

1433
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,800
why does the mutational spectra

1434
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,559
which does allow for this as an

1435
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,960
affordance end up selecting for and

1436
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,040
retaining and enriching for temporally

1437
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,720
deep models otherwise we wouldn't

1438
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,480
observe it to exist

1439
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,960
and they're connecting that to foraging

1440
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,559
intriguingly this is a vertebrate

1441
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,599
example

1442
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,440
the same hippocampal circuits that

1443
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,520
support spatial navigation and foraging

1444
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,760
are also involved in prospection and

1445
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,839
imagination

1446
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,640
this has led busaki and mosser to

1447
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,720
propose that prospective functions have

1448
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,119
leveraged cognitive and predictive maps

1449
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,280
in the hippocampal endorinal system and

1450
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,599
hence mechanisms of memory and planning

1451
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,040
have evolved from mechanisms of

1452
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,680
navigation in the physical world

1453
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,839
so what are the cognitive demands of

1454
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:14,960
foraging

1455
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,599
how about information foraging how about

1456
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,280
mental foraging

1457
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,599
here's some awesome papers by hills and

1458
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,119
cuisine and others

1459
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,880
foraging in mind

1460
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
and foraging in semantic fields how we

1461
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,520
search through memory so what about

1462
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,760
mental foraging

1463
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,920
what about individual and collective

1464
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,359
foraging

1465
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,520
this is an awesome paper by finerman and

1466
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,520
corman in 2017

1467
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,680
and they talk about the continuum and

1468
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,760
the complementarity of individual and

1469
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,599
collective approaches to cognition and

1470
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,359
so implicitly like foraging as a

1471
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,400
phenomena

1472
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,000
some of the affordances and the

1473
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,720
neurophysiology of foraging in ants it's

1474
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,440
the same materials and mechanism that

1475
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,640
any other insect that's not eusocial has

1476
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,119
so the detection of light the intensity

1477
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,440
the wavelength polarization sometimes

1478
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,960
the ability to do

1479
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,040
chemo sensation like taste and smell

1480
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,599
mechanoreception etc and the same action

1481
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,839
affordances too like movement and so

1482
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,599
there definitely is nest mate level

1483
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,680
cognition in ants

1484
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,920
but also there's things that are of a

1485
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,520
few different interesting types one of

1486
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,960
them is

1487
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,200
mesoscale like small group dynamic

1488
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,160
stochastic teams and larger scale like

1489
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,920
colony and even colony niche stigma g

1490
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,640
and ecological scale cognitive processes

1491
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,680
like these two ants are interacting and

1492
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,040
modifying each other's foraging behavior

1493
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,359
mechanistically and statistically but

1494
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,119
also it wouldn't happen unless the niche

1495
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,119
were exactly this way which they have

1496
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,359
also in their extended selves

1497
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,760
established for themselves so

1498
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,280
how do we think about individual and

1499
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,880
collective foraging

1500
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
and stigma g and complex systems

1501
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,200
and mental foraging and cognitive

1502
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,720
demands and cognitive security

1503
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
what about section 11 endowing

1504
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,400
generative models with hierarchical

1505
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,640
depth affords multi-scale inference so

1506
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,880
now we get to the hierarchical operation

1507
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,559
that is going to give that multi-scale

1508
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,400
inference

1509
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,839
so far we have described generative

1510
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,520
models that can deal with aspects of the

1511
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,920
world that unfold at single time scale

1512
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,559
so plus one plus one plus one time scale

1513
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,559
is temporal depth but you're getting

1514
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,880
still only one extra per transformation

1515
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,799
however they can be expanded into

1516
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,119
hierarchically deep models

1517
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,480
whose variables at different

1518
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,640
hierarchical levels encode latent states

1519
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,559
that unfold at different time scales one

1520
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,960
example is a song melody remains the

1521
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,640
same even though the notes we hear or

1522
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,599
sing change rapidly and speech

1523
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,160
similarly a movie or narrative remains

1524
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,000
the same for several minutes scenes

1525
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,079
remain the same for several seconds but

1526
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,160
visual stimuli can change over hundreds

1527
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,839
of milliseconds

1528
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,640
such models permit hierarchical models

1529
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,520
permit

1530
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,319
modeling of narratives

1531
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,760
songs

1532
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,079
movies and other events that change at

1533
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,400
different temporal scales by encoding

1534
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,720
variables that change more slowly eg

1535
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,559
melodies or movies at higher

1536
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,319
hierarchical levels

1537
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,559
and variables that change more rapidly

1538
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,359
eg notes or visual scenes at lower

1539
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,520
hierarchical levels

1540
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
two neurobiological examples of

1541
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,839
hierarchical organization are visual

1542
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,079
areas in mammals and areas that control

1543
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,400
vocal gestures in birdsong

1544
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,839
which has been studied in active

1545
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,920
inference several times

1546
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,200
and so here's another quote from the

1547
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,240
authors

1548
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,680
in more advanced animals the

1549
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,920
hierarchical control of action may have

1550
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,839
expanded into sophisticated forms of

1551
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,760
cognitive control and executive function

1552
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,079
layer 1 scare quotes

1553
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,240
which help prioritize distal goals while

1554
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,799
inhibiting immediate affordances

1555
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,760
so

1556
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
it's not just about seeing deeper within

1557
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
a time scale

1558
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,079
but it's about being able to pull up to

1559
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,079
a higher time scale and then from there

1560
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,319
after the h operation

1561
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,119
it can be followed up with a t operation

1562
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,480
so here's the minute scale

1563
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,240
and then there's a hierarchical

1564
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
duplication that allows for the hour

1565
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,280
scale

1566
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,680
and then that can go into two hours and

1567
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,839
now two minutes so now there's a two

1568
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,359
hour and two minute

1569
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,920
long model instead of a one minute and

1570
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
it was just two mutations but if the two

1571
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
mutations had been um

1572
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,599
or the three mutations had been just

1573
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,760
going deeper within the minutes

1574
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,200
it would be a different outcome

1575
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,799
how is that um functional so what is the

1576
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,720
function and the cost of temporal depth

1577
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,319
just instrumentally

1578
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,079
when we're studying diverse cognitive

1579
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,760
systems how can we detect temporal depth

1580
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,920
and slash versus hierarchical nesting

1581
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,319
then what is the meaning and the role of

1582
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,640
narrative in cognition how does this

1583
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,000
relate to

1584
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,040
narrative information management

1585
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,680
all right section 12 getting towards the

1586
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,599
end

1587
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,839
in the above which was again the

1588
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,720
description of the simple motifs in four

1589
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,240
five six seven

1590
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,960
and then the evolutionary algebra in

1591
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,200
eight and then several of these finer

1592
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,680
scale discussions on 9 and 10

1593
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,040
and 11

1594
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,880
we then get to 12.

1595
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
in the above we formalize brain designs

1596
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,480
in terms of generative models that

1597
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,079
include predictive loops of various

1598
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,520
complexity

1599
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,400
red

1600
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,559
and then discuss the five main ways in

1601
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,160
which generative model designs can be

1602
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,079
elaborated green

1603
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,920
or the five main operations of an

1604
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,079
algebra of evolutionary structure

1605
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,920
learning figure four

1606
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,839
this means that one can describe the

1607
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,160
evolutionary trajectory of brain designs

1608
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,760
in terms of a limited number of

1609
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,599
mutational operations over generative

1610
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,440
models blue

1611
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,319
so

1612
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,599
here is a phylogenetic tree on the right

1613
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,319
side with the

1614
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:06,400
tree of life one of the tree of lives

1615
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,880
what are alternative complementary or

1616
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,400
traditional ways to think about

1617
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,880
phylogenetic trees

1618
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,960
in evolutionary biology

1619
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,440
are phylogenetic trees interpreted

1620
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,839
instrumentally

1621
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,440
are they interpreted under a realism

1622
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,280
framework is that what really happened

1623
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,240
to those species or is it our model

1624
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,799
inference about

1625
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,720
what is the relationship between active

1626
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,319
inference and the free energy principle

1627
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,119
and

1628
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,520
evolution

1629
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,359
okay

1630
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,200
they have figure 5 which gets at their

1631
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,280
phylogenetic model so this is a

1632
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,119
phylogenetic tree of generative model

1633
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,160
designs

1634
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,559
and putative correspondences with animal

1635
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,720
brains so here's the implied ancestral

1636
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,240
state and then

1637
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,079
i

1638
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,839
is going to be the identity operator so

1639
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,680
here the orange species has not mutated

1640
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,000
at all

1641
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,040
now

1642
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,200
sometimes this is um conflated with

1643
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,960
simply being an out group it just

1644
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,160
because it is that way doesn't mean

1645
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,599
they're making the conflation but

1646
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,799
sometimes people will make the

1647
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,720
conflation that because a species is an

1648
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,799
out group to some other clade

1649
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,359
that has been included in the analysis

1650
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,000
that it is the basal or primitive form

1651
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and so it does happen to be that way in

1652
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,119
this example that the basal is the

1653
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,200
so-called least derived or most

1654
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,839
primitive or basal form but

1655
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,200
my personal

1656
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,880
thought is that it should not be

1657
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
described and

1658
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,799
tim link's fair and others have awesome

1659
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,200
writing on that evolutionary fallacy

1660
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,720
so in the rest of the tree which is

1661
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,640
being focused on

1662
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,240
different kinds of operations happen so

1663
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,400
here's that i plus i duplication and

1664
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,200
then

1665
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,799
there's no change after that and then

1666
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,680
this one has a and so on so

1667
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,760
just like you could trace the phenotype

1668
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,920
changing through time on a tree inferred

1669
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,720
from

1670
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,280
trait or genomic data which is just

1671
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,799
another trait

1672
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,040
this maps up to certain changes that are

1673
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,839
seen neuroanatomically over vertebrate

1674
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,520
evolution

1675
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,319
and it reminded me of this paper which

1676
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,359
was um

1677
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,720
chakraborty and jarvis 2015

1678
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,960
and so that is the paper brain evolution

1679
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,040
by brain pathway duplication so they

1680
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,839
don't connect it to um in the exact same

1681
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,000
way the neural cognitive and the

1682
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,319
functional and the active inference and

1683
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,000
all that but this paper does get out

1684
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,079
some of the very similar ideas about the

1685
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,240
functional duplication arising as a

1686
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,520
result of

1687
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,720
pathway duplication

1688
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,200
they have

1689
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,960
a section on brain complexity and

1690
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,119
pathway evolution they talk about some

1691
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,960
alternative hypotheses and then talk

1692
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,880
about distributed and duplicated

1693
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,400
morphological structures so it's a kind

1694
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,920
of interesting paper from about seven

1695
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,280
years ago

1696
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,040
another paper that's very related to

1697
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,119
this idea of doing like an evolutionary

1698
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,680
algebra with combinatorics but also a

1699
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,880
path dependence is this paper

1700
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,640
pretty recently just a couple days ago

1701
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,440
by ryan smith maxwell ramstead and alex

1702
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,160
kiefer the paper is why bayesian brains

1703
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,720
perform poorly on explicit probabilistic

1704
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,319
reasoning problems

1705
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,559
so look at this tree that they have the

1706
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,359
starting point and then three actions so

1707
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,480
here it's like divide divide multiply

1708
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,599
divide

1709
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,200
add divide

1710
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,520
and then they study that in the context

1711
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,760
of bayesian brains and doing

1712
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,839
calculations why is it hard to multiply

1713
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,760
numbers together sometimes

1714
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,119
so then the authors of the paper 38

1715
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,359
right interestingly the mutational

1716
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,920
operators are commutive the same

1717
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,520
generative model design can be obtained

1718
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,440
by executing the same operations but in

1719
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,079
a different order

1720
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,839
the commutative property of mutational

1721
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,839
operators potentially sheds light on the

1722
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,760
convergent evolution

1723
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,440
and the process by which unrelated

1724
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,039
organisms evolve similar traits

1725
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,240
independently

1726
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
and via different evolutionary histories

1727
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,760
when they need to adapt to similar

1728
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,520
ecological niches

1729
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,359
that's pretty cool

1730
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,039
all right so just the discussion and

1731
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,280
then a few last points so discussion and

1732
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,200
the authors summarize it in this article

1733
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,359
we suggest that brain structure or

1734
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,359
design could be formalized as generative

1735
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,880
models agree disagree

1736
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,280
that the brain generative models of our

1737
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,440
evolutionary ancestors included simple

1738
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,599
predictive motifs

1739
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,280
agree disagree

1740
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,599
and that the evolution proceeded via

1741
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,200
successive elaborations of these

1742
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,359
predictive motifs into more complex

1743
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,799
architectures that we observe in

1744
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,119
advanced animals they then talked about

1745
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,559
the ways that that can change through

1746
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,559
time functionally

1747
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,760
and then they write

1748
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,599
while the evolutionary trajectory of

1749
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,119
designs for predictive processing

1750
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,119
proposed here is certainly tentative and

1751
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,359
incomplete we consider it a first step

1752
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,720
towards the alignment of predictive

1753
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,240
brains and evolutionary studies of

1754
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,640
neuroanatomy in different species

1755
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,160
so if this is the first step where are

1756
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,720
we headed and why do we prefer and

1757
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,240
expect ourselves to be there or go there

1758
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,000
just a few more topics that we could

1759
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,680
talk about like in the dot one and in

1760
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,200
the dot two

1761
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,960
um first would be

1762
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,559
they write that the error correction

1763
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,400
mechanisms

1764
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,880
in their view encompass the simple

1765
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,799
and the complex forms of adaptive

1766
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,960
behavior

1767
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,720
hashtag integrative theory

1768
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,920
and they're going to argue that that

1769
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,760
differs significantly from prevalent

1770
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,280
perspectives in psychology and

1771
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,559
neuroscience

1772
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,960
which tend to separate sets of mechanism

1773
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,799
for sensory motor processing and simple

1774
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,400
cognition

1775
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,880
so how is active inference similar and

1776
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,400
different to other frameworks for

1777
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,839
behavior

1778
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,839
what are the building blocks of adaptive

1779
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,599
behavior

1780
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,920
what are the basal blocks of just any

1781
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,599
kind of behavior

1782
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,839
where does sensory motor integration

1783
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,760
come into play

1784
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,160
how about mental functions and cognitive

1785
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,200
functions

1786
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,599
like memory anticipation counterfactuals

1787
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,680
etc

1788
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,359
okay another point to kind of think

1789
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,200
about or write your questions down and

1790
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,559
reflect on

1791
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,480
is the perspective which is still

1792
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,799
speculative and not unchallenged

1793
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,319
suggests that the complexity of the

1794
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,319
ecological niche determines the level of

1795
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,000
complexity that the brain needs to have

1796
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,400
in order to be bayes optimal

1797
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,000
in other words brains only increase

1798
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,520
their complexity with sufficient

1799
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,039
ecological demands

1800
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,680
so not necessarily just that mutational

1801
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,079
direction and intensity will

1802
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,240
go towards increasing brain complexity

1803
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,559
from ecological demands the so-called

1804
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,559
anticipatory evolution that cognitive

1805
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,760
entities can have through

1806
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,000
self-modification and niche modification

1807
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,160
but even for those that aren't actually

1808
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,400
doing anticipation still it could be the

1809
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,039
case that when the ecological demands

1810
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,760
are such that a behavioral model

1811
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,920
increase in complexity is selected for

1812
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,839
and retained then evolution will go that

1813
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:42,880
way

1814
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,160
this is because having a more

1815
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,760
complicated brain does not help if you

1816
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,920
live in a simple niche so that's like a

1817
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,640
very costly model that's not giving you

1818
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,480
any more return on investment

1819
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,799
they then talk about how social brain

1820
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,280
hypothesis states that the necessity to

1821
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,720
predict and deal with sophisticated

1822
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,720
social dynamics was a main driver of the

1823
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,079
evolution of large brains and

1824
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,079
sophisticated cognitive abilities in our

1825
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,000
species people

1826
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,319
in short the gradualism

1827
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,079
expressed as a progressive increase in

1828
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,319
complexity rests on the circular

1829
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,400
causality implicit in the modeling of an

1830
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,640
echo niche that is itself constituted

1831
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,480
and constructed by increasingly

1832
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,119
complicated phenotypes so

1833
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,559
because it's so important to think

1834
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,480
through other minds first just how

1835
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,240
you're going to materially avoid a

1836
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,319
spatial collision but then so the social

1837
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,400
brain hypothesis goes includes

1838
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,240
increasingly recursive levels of game

1839
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,559
theory market theory and all this kind

1840
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,880
of stuff and related indirect cognitive

1841
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,799
phenotypes required like memory and

1842
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,400
recognition

1843
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,000
narrative understanding rhetorical

1844
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,520
understanding governance etc

1845
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,200
that is being

1846
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,400
posited as compatible with the models

1847
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,839
the authors have written and a

1848
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,280
hypothesis that others have written

1849
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,720
about not from an active inference

1850
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,680
perspective though in most cases so what

1851
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,280
is the cognitive niche for social

1852
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,760
entities our material niche and our

1853
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,000
social cognitive niche

1854
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
what is the social brain

1855
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
what is the you social brain

1856
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,440
how are they related

1857
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,760
so for example the social brain

1858
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,760
is saying that the more social things

1859
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,680
are the more sophisticated the brain has

1860
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,680
to be well you need more narrative

1861
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,680
understanding and more memory

1862
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,240
but what if in the eu social case the

1863
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,520
brain is simpler on board for example

1864
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,319
it's more role-based or temporal

1865
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,960
polyethylism has allowed more reduction

1866
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,920
in the

1867
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,000
each phase of the life cycle's brain so

1868
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,240
does social lead to you social

1869
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,240
how does your sociality arise and how

1870
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,599
does it elaborate

1871
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,200
how do different kinds of sociality

1872
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,640
arise and elaborate and how is that

1873
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,319
associated with the different kinds of

1874
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,440
models

1875
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,799
structurally changing that we've been

1876
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,599
discussing in this paper and then just

1877
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,359
genomics all the other stuff gene

1878
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,880
expression

1879
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,119
and then just one last point

1880
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,960
which is the closing piece of their

1881
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
paper too

1882
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,319
finally it is important to acknowledge

1883
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,119
that brains design bodies

1884
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,559
ecological and cultural niches

1885
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,039
co-evolved independently

1886
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,200
not sure if that was dement it's kind of

1887
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,640
like they are codependent in their

1888
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,359
co-evolution but they co-evolved

1889
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,839
they were alone together

1890
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,359
given that here we were interested in

1891
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,799
the evolution of brain designs we

1892
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,560
assumed a brain-centric perspective and

1893
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,158
conveniently focused on generative

1894
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,319
models in the animal's brain

1895
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,960
hashtag realism

1896
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,439
in the brain not modeled as in the brain

1897
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,198
however cognition does not need to be

1898
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,198
confined in the skull to be

1899
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,120
it can be extended outside it to cover

1900
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,679
for example tools and social dimensions

1901
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,719
epistemic niche niche modification

1902
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,198
digital stigma she furthermore the body

1903
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,600
design and not just brain design plays

1904
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,279
an important role in solving control

1905
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,679
problems acknowledging that cognition

1906
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,158
can be extended and embodied and in

1907
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,238
cultured etc all the e's all the other

1908
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,198
letters

1909
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,439
suggests that not all aspects of control

1910
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,520
need to be solved by or represented in a

1911
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,359
central generative model

1912
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,960
tale of two densities

1913
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,319
all the discussions we've been having

1914
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,198
about representation and so it was x and

1915
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,600
x star in the simple version that was

1916
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,439
presented in this paper where was

1917
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,679
actually trying to track x star in the

1918
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,880
world with the internal inference but

1919
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,238
this is the discussion that we've been

1920
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,520
having

1921
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,279
do those representations have to

1922
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,880
structurally resemble

1923
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,120
the world and there's other papers that

1924
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,399
we've discussed in the last several

1925
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,640
weeks that really touch on that point so

1926
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,319
how do we think about generative models

1927
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,839
and factor graphs

1928
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,399
for extended cognitive processes

1929
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,560
so a couple books to check out about

1930
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,520
extended mind and embodied cognition and

1931
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,439
then here's a nice figure from touch

1932
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:46,640
points

1933
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,439
with

1934
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,399
the brain

1935
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,120
the organs and the body

1936
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,279
the world and the tools and the

1937
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,280
epistemic niche and the computers like a

1938
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,920
calculator and time chronos

1939
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,480
and food and then other people

1940
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,320
social so that's like cognition is like

1941
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,080
a holistic integration of all these

1942
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,520
features

1943
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,360
what does embodiment

1944
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,000
this perspective have to do with realism

1945
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,440
and instrumentalism

1946
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,199
and utilitarianism and other

1947
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,719
philosophical positions

1948
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,719
are people really taking those positions

1949
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,400
or is it just as if they're taking those

1950
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,760
positions

1951
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,520
and then what else are you really

1952
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,640
curious about and motivated to explore

1953
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,719
and how will you modify and improve your

1954
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,560
epistemic niche

1955
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,520
so

1956
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,239
hope you enjoyed this kind of

1957
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,520
solo

1958
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,679
0 video i think it's been a little bit

1959
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,920
since the solo.0s

1960
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,440
but just want to close as always with

1961
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,600
what might a good understanding enable

1962
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,199
what are the unique predictions and

1963
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,640
implications

1964
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,320
what are the next steps for free energy

1965
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,080
principle and active inference research

1966
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,600
and application

1967
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,080
what are the goals of this research

1968
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,520
and what are you

1969
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,120
still curious about

1970
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,280
we're going to be talking about this

1971
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,640
paper

1972
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,640
in the coming weeks

1973
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,000
on february 16th and february 23rd

1974
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,400
and so if you'd like to participate in

1975
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,440
those

1976
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,679
discussions through live chat or by

1977
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,840
joining the discussions live just get in

1978
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,159
contact with us hope you read this paper

1979
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,159
because it's very thought provocative

1980
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,480
and uh interesting so

1981
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,440
enjoy the paper and

1982
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,920
working through it i hope to see you in

1983
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,400
other acting flap activities

1984
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,320
thanks for listening in your regime of

1985
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,719
attention goodbye
