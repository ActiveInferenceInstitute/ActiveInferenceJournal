00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:32,677
Hello and welcome everyone, to ActInf

2
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:35,617
Livestream number 38 two. It's February

3
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:39,247
23, 2022. Welcome to ActInf

4
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,417
Lab. We are a participatory online lab

5
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:42,902
that is communicating, learning, and

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,737
practicing applied active inference.

7
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,232
You can find us at the links here on

8
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:48,602
this page. This is a recorded and an

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,252
archived livestream, so please provide

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,847
us with feedback so that we can improve

11
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,002
our work. All backgrounds and

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,042
perspectives are welcome and will follow

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,812
good video etiquette for live streams.

14
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:02,642
Go to activeinprints.org to learn more

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,042
about how to participate in any of these

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,842
live streams, which are part of the

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,277
Comma Communications Organizational unit

18
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,107
or just any other part of the lab. All

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,317
right, today in Active stream number 38

20
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,432
two, we're going to be having our third

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,567
discussion. There is the zero, the one,

22
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,477
and now the two on this paper, the

23
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,292
Evolution of Brain Architectures for

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,612
Predictive Coding and Active Inference.

25
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:31,487
And maybe each of us have a few

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,452
ideas in mind and I'm sure we'll come up

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,027
with a few other things. Plus, if

28
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,247
anyone's watching live, they can write a

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,572
comment in the chat. So we'll start with

30
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:43,412
just introduction, saying anything

31
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,052
if we want about the paper before just

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,367
jumping in somewhere or somewhere else.

33
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,497
I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,437
California, and I will pass it to Dean.

35
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,650
Hi, I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary and

36
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:05,797
I'm not doing very much except

37
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,207
trying to keep up with all the papers

38
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,452
that we're looking at in active

39
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:09,977
inference. And I'll pass it down to

40
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:13,372
Bleu. I'm Bleu.

41
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,087
I'm a research consultant in New Mexico,

42
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:19,352
and I really enjoyed this paper

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,577
for many reasons. My background in

44
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:25,500
neuroscience not, like,

45
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:29,942
being a priority, but yeah, it is. So

46
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,547
I'm excited to get into it and to

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,157
discuss some of the points that I picked

48
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,125
up with you guys.

49
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:37,275
Okay, well,

50
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,717
Bleu joining us today.

51
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:45,467
What figure can we start with? Or start

52
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,977
with a blank sheet and just any of

53
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:51,272
the points that you'd like to raise or

54
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:52,950
we can do something else.

55
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:59,147
Man, figure four for me was like,

56
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,002
awesome. So maybe that was my favorite

57
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,602
figure. Maybe that's the one we should

58
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,532
start with. Okay, all right,

59
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:11,272
so what was your just perspective

60
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,172
on what figure four was and then what

61
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,852
did it mean or why was it interactions

62
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,617
for you? So I was

63
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,567
interested in this figure and maybe

64
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,552
like, even in how this figure could be

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,607
expanded in terms of hierarchical depth

66
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:31,987
and temporal depth. And temporal depth

67
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:36,617
has more than one potential scale which

68
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,677
isn't really mentioned here.

69
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,925
Temporal depth can be thought of as

70
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:45,572
small time steps. What am I going to do

71
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,992
next? What's my next action? But also in

72
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,497
bigger time steps, what is the next

73
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,927
interactions of me and how these

74
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,077
hierarchical depths? Because that's

75
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:57,617
obviously like a larger levels

76
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,047
hierarchy, like the next iteration of me

77
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,047
as a species or as a human species.

78
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,377
Right? Like, what is the next

79
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,222
interactions of the species versus what

80
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,757
is the next action I'm going to perform

81
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,157
as part of the species. So that was kind

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,087
of an interactions like perspectival

83
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:18,467
dance that they took and just really

84
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,647
like the multi dimensionality of

85
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,602
this and how to kind of think about it

86
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,562
in like, maybe like is this like

87
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,522
a multi dimensional space in terms

88
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,552
of like, my cells, what are my cells

89
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:36,622
going to do next? My tissues, my organs,

90
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,925
knee, active inference lab, lab.

91
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,477
What are all these things going to do

92
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:44,327
next? And also on that level, is that

93
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:46,277
like a short time frame or is it like a

94
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,592
large time free? And do the time frames

95
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,617
differ or can the same hierarchical

96
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:54,527
level have more than one time frame or

97
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,125
not?

98
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,800
Okay, nice questions. Dean, what do you

99
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:08,762
think about any of that as we start to

100
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,312
look at figure four as a starting point

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,052
for talking more about what Bleu just

102
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,327
mentioned? Well, I think one

103
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,622
of the things we touched on in the .1

104
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:23,677
was the idea that within a frame there's

105
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:27,352
also an orthogonal mesh. So as we push

106
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:31,352
through this representation from the

107
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,827
bottom up, are we going from what might

108
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,392
be described as an architectural

109
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:39,077
existence to at the top, what we

110
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,002
might describe as architectural

111
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:43,050
learning? Now, of course,

112
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:46,577
if we take that position, we have to be

113
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,472
careful that we're not reinforcing the

114
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,637
idea that it's all about constructivism

115
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:55,287
all the time versus being creative.

116
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:57,407
Right. Like, I think you need to be a

117
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,312
little bit of both. And I'm not being

118
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,997
creationist, like, not one story that

119
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,977
carries for it all the way through time

120
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,307
as Bleu kind of ref there,

121
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,977
but the idea that the updating matters

122
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,627
throughout the time scale that you

123
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,372
choose to look at. And so now the

124
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:21,247
question is, is architectures the lens

125
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:23,612
that we should be using to talk about

126
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,077
how we advance from mere existence to a

127
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,577
place that we would describe as

128
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:29,175
learning?

129
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,277
I mean, that's what it was chosen here.

130
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,757
But is that the one way now?

131
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:42,442
Right? It's a way. It's a good way.

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,767
Certainly make something super, super

133
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,267
complex into something that's just

134
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:49,057
complicated. But is it the only way? I

135
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,775
don't know.

136
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:55,447
Just one question

137
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,877
of clarification. When you said this is

138
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,542
the only way, what were you referring to

139
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,550
this figure for? Or what?

140
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:05,392
To the idea of an architectures. Right.

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,692
The architectures lens, as opposed to

142
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,347
other ways that we might build out this

143
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,737
idea of going from homeostatic evidence

144
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:19,902
to going from unknowing to knowing

145
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:21,725
and whatever that means.

146
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:30,447
Okay, thanks for sharing

147
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,422
it. Just to kind of maybe connect this.

148
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,307
You mentioned architectural disturbance,

149
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:39,247
which is within the metered space.

150
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,322
Whatever the metric is or the measure or

151
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:45,652
the grids that you draw, there's a

152
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,102
distance within a map and that's like

153
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,247
the ecological transect. That's the

154
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,717
Blueprint, that's the forensic analysis.

155
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,467
And then that's like parametric learning

156
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,962
because it's a distortion of parameters

157
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:02,332
in a given space and then

158
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,122
fully defined, not just like space for

159
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,422
openness whereas the architectural

160
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,912
learning is at the structural level,

161
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,852
architectural. And then that was kind of

162
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,577
like what you related to not just the

163
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,567
homeostatic or even the allostasis

164
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:21,187
perhaps, but something that's like the

165
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,592
sort of unknown, unknown open

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,222
ended ness, biological open,

167
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:31,747
evolutionary trajectories. So not just

168
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,852
sustaining it, but actually realizing

169
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:34,475
it.

170
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,632
So we'll just get a few notes on each of

171
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,522
these transformations, then see what

172
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,592
other ones or like what are some

173
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,422
situations that might model and then

174
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:53,000
also return to the questions that were

175
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:55,912
raised early by Bleu, like with the

176
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:59,172
multilevel self and where's

177
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,047
mental action or thought.

178
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,962
In this model, the examples were

179
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,177
provided of like, for example, the Alo

180
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:13,152
stat that took the temperature homeostat

181
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,902
and then added in in their example like

182
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,837
the Sunrise visual detector and modeler

183
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,452
column. And so that gave the

184
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,272
anticipatory change in body temperature

185
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:26,092
when the sun was viewed. But then

186
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,992
is there a similar structure for

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,052
cognition? Is it just like linking

188
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,792
together senses in more and more

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,300
combinatoric way? It's a very sense

190
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,602
oriented perspective which from an

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,077
evolutionary perspective, which is what

192
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:47,047
this paper is exploring, that's the one

193
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,177
to ground further elaborations and

194
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:52,842
changes on rather than trying to reverse

195
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,672
from something like engaging

196
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:57,132
counterfactuals. So just using an active

197
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,002
inference model, sometimes for a

198
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,667
counterfactual agent, if the model says

199
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,747
that that's okay or doing the bacteria

200
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,452
without implying that it's doing the

201
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,627
counterfactual explicitly, that might be

202
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:08,600
possible too.

203
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,372
So we have thermal regulation in the

204
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:18,997
paper. But then the question is, does

205
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,967
that equate to feelings in a human

206
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,525
being? Right?

207
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:27,982
Like if all that feelings cover

208
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,832
necessarily collapse down to the example

209
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,875
of thermal regulation? And at what point

210
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:36,022
are we aware of the fact that there

211
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,822
might be a difference between the

212
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:41,617
example and the concept? Like where

213
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:45,222
in this figure four is that blurry

214
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:48,097
line that we cross? It's a good

215
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,675
question. I don't know where it is

216
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,817
subtina. You're talking about feelings

217
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,642
like emotions or feelings like

218
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,072
sensations or both? Yeah, all of that,

219
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:00,097
right? Like so feelings tends to take on

220
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,192
a big sort of it's more detached from

221
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,372
the example of thermal regulation. And

222
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,502
yet that's just the fact that you can

223
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,067
ask that question proves out that maybe

224
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:15,247
the one example doesn't cover all of the

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,222
different aspects of the higher concept,

226
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,737
right? That's where the scaling part

227
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,822
comes in. So it's not just temporal

228
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,557
depth that allows for that. You have to

229
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,982
have the temporal depth and the

230
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:32,867
hierarchical depth what

231
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,025
kind of feelings are you talking about?

232
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:38,792
Implies that there's more than

233
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,302
one way that has to exist for you

234
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,047
to come at that to ask that question

235
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,337
where do we draw the partition?

236
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:52,727
Right? So in here they

237
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,357
show duplication. But I'm not going

238
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,432
to say it misleads, but it potentially

239
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,527
mislead if you think that there's a

240
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:04,097
linearity to this. But in fact, a couple

241
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,322
of times Daniel talked in the .1 about

242
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,257
the fact that there is a step function

243
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:12,272
moment. There is a jump. It's not a

244
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:16,277
jump. I forget about

245
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,872
one example where we can't say you just

246
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,502
go from one eye to two just because I

247
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,852
think that was one of the examples you

248
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,817
gave Daniel. But at some over

249
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,892
evolutionary time there is these little

250
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,872
progressions where if you look back on

251
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:33,862
it, it seems like a rather large jump

252
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:36,750
took place. Right?

253
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:44,372
Let me give a few points there.

254
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,102
So when you said, like the big jumps and

255
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,097
so in one sense that's related

256
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,617
to the kind of discussion around complex

257
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:55,472
patterns of evolution and some

258
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,302
phenotypes or genotype regions that are

259
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,982
very stable through long periods of

260
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,602
time. Over many generations, like the

261
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,842
ultra conserved elements in the genome

262
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,122
that have very low mutation rates versus

263
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,652
regions that have high mutation rates,

264
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,337
et cetera. And then same as phenotypes,

265
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,647
like phenotypes that are very constant,

266
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,657
like the silicon fish or phenotypes that

267
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,402
are very plastic or dynamic or ones that

268
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,025
we just don't have the records of.

269
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,772
And then how to connect what is

270
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,977
happening or the models that we want to

271
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:31,862
make in humans, especially with computer

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,967
enabled and language enabled humans,

273
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,422
technology enabled humans with the

274
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:39,837
continuum of cognitive processes.

275
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,522
And then you said like, it's not linear.

276
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:47,147
And then that kind of image

277
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,877
me think like there's like feelings,

278
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:53,287
which is still a rich qualitative

279
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:55,247
area, like you brought out like

280
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,152
sensations but also experiences and

281
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,950
emotions. And then how quickly,

282
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:05,552
securely or unambiguously can we

283
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,182
map just that cloud of concepts just to

284
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,522
be like it's a policy selection on

285
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,282
attention, it's an uncertainty on

286
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:17,797
valence, it's valence. Like we're

287
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,522
doing the parametric cognition model

288
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:23,702
with this, but it's still even a little

289
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,522
bit open. What this represents. Is this

290
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:30,437
the evolutionary biologists doing model

291
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,472
testing on a phylogenetic tree? Or is

292
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,427
this talking about the genomic or the

293
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,977
neurophysiological components that have

294
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:43,202
to be connected just anatomically for a

295
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,492
certain function to arise? And that

296
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,222
is the rich area that there's so much to

297
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,832
explore in too. Well, I think the one

298
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,057
thing we can agree on is because we're

299
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,297
talking about evolution, we're talking

300
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,492
about history. So it is backwards

301
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:01,267
looking and backwards looking is easier

302
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:04,682
than looking into the future, right?

303
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,067
So I think that's one thing we can agree

304
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,197
on. But what this is trying to do is

305
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,647
explain perhaps how the history came

306
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,397
about. So one

307
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,917
thing that the authors mentioned as well

308
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,627
and that's kind of Linsker to the idea

309
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,302
of feelings. This was a

310
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,137
discussion about the evolution of brain

311
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:28,772
architectures. But there's also the fact

312
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,282
that brains are in bodies. They don't

313
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,622
just exist in jars. For me at

314
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,567
least, I feel like I feel like

315
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:41,272
emotions, not necessarily sensations,

316
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,682
but I feel like emotions are driven in a

317
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:46,050
large part by the body.

318
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,712
We've made a huge kind of connection

319
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:52,667
between the gut and the brain and

320
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,575
there's probably more connections to be

321
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:59,497
felt because I feel feelings,

322
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,027
like emotions deeply in my body. Like,

323
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,527
I feel them in my heart or I feel in my

324
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,182
stomach or I feel, like, in my pinky

325
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,987
toe. So I really think that the idea of

326
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,772
emotions can't be separated

327
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:16,907
from embodiment. But prediction, I think

328
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,202
it's a mental activity, or at least I

329
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,652
feel it in my brain. So I don't know if

330
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,147
that's the same kind of sensation that

331
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,537
everyone has, but prediction is,

332
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:32,177
in my mind, a brain thing. But I know

333
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:35,357
that's overriding. If someone throws a

334
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,102
Bull at me, I put my hand up like that's

335
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:40,672
a reflux. But is that like my brain

336
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,517
driving my body? I'm not sure, really.

337
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,777
But I know that there's some prediction

338
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,337
that's maybe not mental, that's more

339
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,752
like physical or that's more embodied is

340
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,950
probably the right word.

341
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,342
And you kind of move into that intuitive

342
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,542
space as well. Right? Like, if you think

343
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,047
about going to the beach, I can't tell

344
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,127
whether you're going to think about the

345
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,922
wetness aspects of that, the warmness

346
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:10,342
part of that, the smell of the sunscreen

347
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,947
part of that. But you're going to but

348
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,957
that prediction isn't going to also

349
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,802
generate embodied emotions.

350
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:20,852
Even though you may not articulate them.

351
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,642
Right. You're still intuiting them,

352
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,177
you're still anticipating them. And so

353
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:29,452
I'm not sure how the architectures pulls

354
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,322
that out, especially to Daniel's point,

355
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,862
where our form has

356
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:38,222
adapted evolutionarily to the

357
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:40,592
phenotypical situation that we find

358
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,125
ourselves in. And going forward,

359
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,572
let's say that sea levels rise and

360
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,552
suddenly you have beachfront property

361
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,582
where for millions of years you did not.

362
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,787
How does that affect now your emotions?

363
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:01,162
Right. I like the architectural

364
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,872
idea of being able to take something and

365
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:06,377
look at the historicity of it and be

366
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:09,302
able to explain it out with a little bit

367
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,587
more confidence.

368
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,897
I'm not sure, though. I'm still

369
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,027
struggling with being able to figure out

370
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,175
how, if we want to look ahead,

371
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:23,452
we can necessarily set it up the layered

372
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,397
way it was set up here. And I really

373
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,532
like figure four, but I just have

374
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,577
to categorize it and keep it where it's

375
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:33,142
most useful, which is in the backwards

376
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:35,925
facing part of this. That's all.

377
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:41,475
Okay, let's return to how to use this.

378
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,802
That sounds like a good question, but

379
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,647
we'll get there. So Lou

380
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,327
brought up the brain and compliment with

381
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:51,892
the body. And this was just the quote

382
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:54,467
from the very final lines of the paper,

383
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,722
or near the ends, where they

384
00:18:57,755 --> 00:19:01,822
acknowledged that partial perspective

385
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,962
that they presented in the paper.

386
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,522
Partial learning. Just a portion of,

387
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:08,027
but also partial, like partial to a

388
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:11,177
certain view because there was a

389
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,697
neuroscience regime of attention. And

390
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,542
that's the contribution that was made

391
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,507
that helps apply to other systems. And

392
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,427
then there's another synthesis to be

393
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,272
made. And this is kind of like the

394
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:24,857
opening where they just acknowledge that

395
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,052
cognition can be extended and embodied.

396
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,027
And it suggests that not all aspects of

397
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:30,497
control need to be solved by or

398
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,487
represented a central generative models.

399
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,942
So it's this point that we've come to

400
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,072
from many different angles from like,

401
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,952
the ecological and the cognitive and

402
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,697
then here from more of a structure

403
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:46,172
learning perspective that like the

404
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:49,277
representation, whether just in the

405
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:52,157
model of a system or in the system's own

406
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:55,247
self representation. It doesn't have to

407
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,192
be the exact same thing as some

408
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:02,492
latent variable in the outside world.

409
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,247
So it's possible to have like an

410
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,297
effective model of climate action

411
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,125
without a perfectly accuracy model.

412
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,007
But that has to be understood within

413
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,077
like was brought up a space of

414
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,777
counterfactuals of what could happen

415
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,972
from the outside world where we really

416
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,357
never can eradicate the total

417
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,357
distribution and also the introduction

418
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,532
of the unknown unknowns. And so that's

419
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:30,172
the fundamental openness of the external

420
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:33,692
states and the modelers view.

421
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,652
And then there's still a lot to

422
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,677
explore with the counterfactuals of the

423
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:43,097
models that the system that like

424
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,687
the agent is can implement.

425
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,027
But I think that gets a little bit of

426
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:53,327
how to start to use it in

427
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:54,750
a certain area.

428
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,117
Any thoughts or what? I got a question

429
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,687
for you, Dean. When you study dance,

430
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,307
for example, and they're foraging and I

431
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,547
think it's section eight or I forget

432
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,572
what section that they say foraging

433
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,597
really, really matters. I think if we're

434
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,457
point toing this now, I think that the

435
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,422
sort of the go forward piece of this is

436
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:20,977
now, when you started looking at ants,

437
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:22,882
did you start from a cognition? I don't

438
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,227
know what your background is, but did

439
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:27,062
you start from a position of sort of

440
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,797
pulling apart the historicity of why

441
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:33,827
that thing is now sort of laid out the

442
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:38,822
way it is? I know there's a

443
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,177
piece of that that's there. But is that

444
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,977
the place where most people that begin a

445
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:46,427
study start? Which is kind of

446
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:48,752
interesting about this paper because to

447
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,792
me going from existence

448
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:55,682
to learning implies a certain history.

449
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,572
And so I'm wondering how you sort of

450
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,447
come at things when you see them

451
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,527
foraging where history fits in

452
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,047
terms of that you gaining some

453
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
understanding of what's happening here

454
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:11,250
as opposed to then what happens.

455
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:16,802
Great question. The topic is

456
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,922
historiosity and foraging for 400 from

457
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:23,027
Dean Bleu. What would you say on the

458
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,562
topic first? How would you bring that

459
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,107
together? What would be some important

460
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:30,722
points? So I

461
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,217
really like this idea also and I have a

462
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,377
completely unrelated point and then an

463
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:39,832
unrelated question. It says mechanisms

464
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,197
of memory and planning have evolved from

465
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,662
mechanisms of navigation in the physical

466
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,372
world. And some super interesting that I

467
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,367
thought. Side point was if you've never

468
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:52,887
read the book, deep Work by Cal Newport.

469
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,652
He talks about memorizing a deck of

470
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,957
cards. If you haven't read the book,

471
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,657
read the book. But it's interesting

472
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:02,637
because he goes through a very elaborate

473
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:05,902
way to memorize a deck of cards and it's

474
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:08,987
through building a memory palace. And so

475
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,097
in this memory palace, you have a place

476
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,597
that you know very well, like your own

477
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,952
house. You can imagine walking through

478
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,677
your door. You imagine the porch, the

479
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:22,547
doorstep, how it looks. You imagine the

480
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,012
doorway, all the rooms, all the closets.

481
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,627
Like, you imagine going through your

482
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,072
house, taking a tour, and exploring each

483
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,127
room in a very systematic way. So it's

484
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,852
very easy to memorize a route you would

485
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,027
take to your house. Like, say you're

486
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,407
looking for a ghost in your closet or

487
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:37,802
something, hiding in your house. How

488
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,572
would you look? So you go through your

489
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:42,967
house, so you have this palace,

490
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:44,747
right, that you have in your mind. And

491
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,572
then he talks about making every card

492
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,672
a character, right? Like, the queen

493
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:55,982
of hearts is Queen Elizabeth or

494
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,297
something. Like, who is each character

495
00:23:58,342 --> 00:24:01,502
in the cards deck? So each character in

496
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,152
the card deck becomes a character that

497
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,627
you memorize. So you memorize these 52

498
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,875
cards as people that you know.

499
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:10,667
And so this is an interesting point also

500
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,322
on the socio dynamics as well as the

501
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,827
spatial dynamics. So each character in

502
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,507
the deck is a person that you know well.

503
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:19,552
You memorize that 52 people correspond

504
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:21,002
to these 52 cards, and you know the

505
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,177
layout of your house. So then when you

506
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,772
can go through the order of the deck,

507
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,327
anybody can do it. You can repeat back

508
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,127
the order right away. So, like, you go

509
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,747
through the cards and you say, okay,

510
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,097
you can go through it three or four

511
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,282
times, and then you know the entire

512
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,427
order of the deck of cards. So this is

513
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:36,652
how to repeat back the order of a deck

514
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:40,367
of cards just to memorize the order,

515
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:42,007
like, oh, they're supreme hearts, she's

516
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,482
in a positive, or who's standing in the

517
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,847
doorway is like, the first part, right?

518
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,077
And so, you know the tour through the

519
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,447
house, and you place these people in

520
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,250
this spatial orientation in your house.

521
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:56,702
And this is like a proven solid way the

522
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,072
people that do these kind of memory

523
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:00,472
trips use by constructing this memory

524
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:01,817
house. And I thought that that was super

525
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:04,907
interesting in relation to this paper,

526
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,682
that memory and planning have evolved

527
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:09,077
from mechanisms of navigation in the

528
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,747
physical world. And I also wonder if

529
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,227
there is, like, a social role that also

530
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,297
contributes to memory, and could that

531
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,102
social role be this kind of higher

532
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,577
level? Allostasis right, like, we talk

533
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:24,197
about the homeostat and that's like,

534
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,672
there's no other like, you've got one

535
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,277
time step, right? And then in the out of

536
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,152
step, there's other ways to kind of

537
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,677
modify, but how many in the

538
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:36,002
social components to succeed and

539
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,772
function and to actively have memory and

540
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,097
prediction? Like, does a tissue have

541
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,852
memory because there's other cells in

542
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,942
the tissue? Does an ant have memory

543
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,752
because it can spatially navigate for

544
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,907
food and also it knows its friends? I'm

545
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,972
sure ants have ways to distinguish one

546
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,182
ant from another ants. Like, they're

547
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,457
very social features. I don't think that

548
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:56,627
they all think that they're all the

549
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,082
same. Like, my cats don't definitely

550
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,857
don't. My cats know each other. But if

551
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,537
you showed them, like, a stray cat,

552
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,142
they'd be really upset with a stray cat,

553
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,227
I'm sure. So, you know, animals know

554
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,952
each other, I'm sure ants know each

555
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,322
other also. And so what component of

556
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:13,712
memory is also social? And that just

557
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,182
Jelle me points to help remind me of

558
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,372
that or brought that to, like, sorry if

559
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:18,300
I have any questions.

560
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:24,152
Awesome. It brings up a lot of the

561
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,627
aspects that I could add to now just

562
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:29,787
from a specifically anti perspective.

563
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,167
So you mentioned the evolutionary

564
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,757
aspect. It's one of the themes of the

565
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:38,122
paper that perhaps from foraging,

566
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:41,042
but other processes, too, as key

567
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,832
cognitive demands, those early

568
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,597
challenges or, like, ancestral

569
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,827
challenges giving rise to current life

570
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:53,102
were faced and met in this way. So that

571
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,452
was the evolutionary aspect you

572
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,497
mentioned. And then thinking about the

573
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,527
history at multiple nested scales. So,

574
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:02,042
like, there's the history of the ant

575
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,647
colony as a genuine modelable

576
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:08,717
entity, where the colony, year after

577
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,762
year kind of developed in its foraging

578
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,417
territory as its colony personality or

579
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,950
basically phenotype at the colony level

580
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:21,225
evolve. And then asterisk one

581
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:25,052
then at the nest mate level, it's the

582
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,722
recent interactions of a nest mate that

583
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:30,397
induce it to forge locally, meaning

584
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,897
retrieving a seed. So, like, there might

585
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,282
be an ant whose current neural or

586
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,277
hormonal state is such that a lot of

587
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:39,337
interactions with incoming foragers

588
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,702
don't stimulate more foraging. But then

589
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,972
there might be another ant whose status

590
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:47,402
is such that a certain reduced rate of

591
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,072
interactions with other foragers, maybe

592
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,027
even no interactions with other foragers

593
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,557
in the entry chamber cause it to go on a

594
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,077
foraging trip. That foraging biology is

595
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:58,577
specific to this ant shown here, the

596
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,427
harvester ant. But maybe other ants,

597
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,402
too, care that asterisk too. Then

598
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,472
there's the ant tissue. And, like, each

599
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:07,202
of the ant tissues, the brain, the

600
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,247
different glands, the gut, they're all

601
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,447
undergoing kind of stereotyped

602
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,027
transitions that are called temporal

603
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:18,047
polyethylem, or they're going through,

604
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,027
like, recent changes, like a leg was

605
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:21,347
lost and then the least of the body,

606
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,382
like, adaptive. So that's, like, the

607
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:24,537
history of each nest mate tissue.

608
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,772
The asterisk kind of combined for me

609
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:31,067
personally, but also just more

610
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,977
conceptually with thinking about the

611
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,832
relational view on modeling the ants,

612
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:40,727
like, not taking too strong a

613
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,427
view on where phenomena should be

614
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:45,427
located in terms of nest mate versus

615
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,347
collective cognitive features and then

616
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,402
also the place based and the field and

617
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,537
the long term experiments. So my

618
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,522
advisor, Professor Deborah Gordon, has

619
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:59,147
done, like, a 30 year plus field study

620
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,342
in Arizona. And so I was doing five

621
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,447
years of fieldwork there, but it was,

622
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,342
like, year, I don't know, 20 something

623
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,487
or 30 something to some other number

624
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,817
five years later in this space where

625
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,322
there was a lot known about this ant

626
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,617
with a long lived colony, but with

627
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:22,262
turnover of the foragers. And so the

628
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:25,892
sort of ecological and the place based

629
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,277
nature and then also the specific

630
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,177
biology of this ant where the forager

631
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:33,917
was just so clearly an expendable part

632
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,747
of the process of the colony, like

633
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,582
sloughed off and some other features of

634
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:40,587
the foraging biology of these ants.

635
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,597
Pretty interesting system and it reveals

636
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,872
a lot on different cognitive demands and

637
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:48,302
different foraging environments. So

638
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,547
that's not even getting into the whole

639
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,802
mental foraging or active component,

640
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,300
but just at the ant foraging level.

641
00:29:58,487 --> 00:29:59,912
I think you brought up an important

642
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:02,102
point, though, Daniel, and I'm not sure

643
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,777
if people associate architecture with

644
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,302
abduction, but your

645
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:12,127
advisor, supervisor, whatever her title

646
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,812
was, her 30 year window and then

647
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,992
where you stepped in for your five year

648
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,687
window as Nested,

649
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:26,747
you were the one now Nested within a

650
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,242
larger time frame. So back to Blues

651
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,597
earlier point, but you weren't

652
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:34,397
historically looking back from the

653
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,872
perspective, okay, here's the

654
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,572
evolutionary nature. You are now seeing

655
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,272
yourself as relative to something that

656
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:46,582
had a greater timestamp,

657
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:48,947
right? So you walked into the party and

658
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,322
you had to ask yourself, did these ants

659
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:54,677
come from this colony? So back to

660
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,947
Perth's, big question of right.

661
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,452
So it's when I come into the situation

662
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,517
that matters as much as if I can induce

663
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:07,200
a skyscraper or deduce how much

664
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:10,807
structural rigidity that requires.

665
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:14,447
Right. So I think this is kind of

666
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,987
interesting now because I'm not sure

667
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,952
if we should assume, like when you were

668
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,492
talking about the phylogenetic trees,

669
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,877
sometimes we just assume we're stepping

670
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:28,202
in on the

671
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,347
branching, but I'm not sure we should

672
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,027
make that assumption. I think we have to

673
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,097
be careful to be, as you said, very

674
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,692
explicit, not just assumptive of where

675
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,077
we come in in this history. Because if

676
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:41,177
we don't, we can end up thinking that

677
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:44,462
this is sort of a linear layering that

678
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:47,867
figure four, when maybe it's more like

679
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:51,317
identity. It's both stable and

680
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:52,287
dynamic.

681
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:02,072
So it's definitely related to almost the

682
00:32:02,105 --> 00:32:04,725
very first comments of Bleu, like,

683
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,397
where's multiscale identity and

684
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,287
multiscale systems in this hierarchical

685
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,087
depth,

686
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:17,475
it may be related in some way to

687
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,147
multiscale systems. We could draw that

688
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,352
out. But where is that nesting that

689
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,472
we're describing, the real physical

690
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:27,722
enclosure sense? And this way

691
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:29,372
that mental systems can almost be

692
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,042
modeled as Nested, just like we saw

693
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,682
mental action as a nesting of a

694
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,992
cognitive model with an action model

695
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,312
inside of it. It's like the mental

696
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:44,362
is encoding and even modeling

697
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,682
through inclusion of the Perry personal

698
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,275
space, but then with like a drop off

699
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:53,475
going further out and then what is that

700
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:59,252
modeling space? And is

701
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,067
there another operation here? Again,

702
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:03,227
what are these graphs? What are we

703
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:06,975
seeing here? Dean, my question is

704
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:11,252
to answer Blue's question. Do we

705
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,147
get closer to a satisfactory answer by

706
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:17,102
looking at the mechanics of this or do

707
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,592
we get a better sense of it by seeing

708
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,197
the relationship. Like when you were

709
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,182
explaining the ant part you've spent a

710
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,875
lot of time talking about relationship

711
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:29,597
and I think maybe one of the things we

712
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,177
try to do is we try to apply the

713
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:35,327
operation to it when in fact what we

714
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,827
should be doing is seeing the

715
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:39,712
relationship in its entirety.

716
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:43,097
I don't want to say zoom out because

717
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,927
you can still zoom out and still get

718
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:47,447
bogged down in the sequencing because

719
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,742
that's kind of what this does. It says

720
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,367
this layer of sequencing can now build

721
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:54,757
out, fractal out into these other layers

722
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:57,392
of sequencing. And I'm suggesting rather

723
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,122
than seeing the layers, maybe it's the

724
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:03,352
totality of the relationships. I don't

725
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:06,452
know because Bleu also pointed to the

726
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,467
social piece which is all relationship

727
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,777
all the time, right? So I'm just

728
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:15,197
wondering if we help ourselves if we

729
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,447
collapse to oh, well, this is now

730
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,775
explainable. Because we have some way of

731
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:22,962
showing the sequence.

732
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,177
Sometimes that helps, but maybe in this

733
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:28,897
case it's from an evolutionary

734
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,067
standpoint it doesn't matter whether

735
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,572
we're talking about 1000 years ago and

736
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,692
today as much as the relationship of

737
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,692
what 100,000 years ago and today

738
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,367
represents. I don't know,

739
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,000
just throwing it out there.

740
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:48,452
Thanks for sharing it. Just one thought

741
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,550
on that and then we'll continue here.

742
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:55,772
Phylogenetic trees with genomic data are

743
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:59,047
usually based upon sequence alignment

744
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,502
followed by the fitting of a tree on the

745
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,502
aligned sections of the sequences. And

746
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,552
so there's a lot of ways and approaches

747
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:10,252
of modeling from the sequence alignment

748
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,797
itself from unaligned to align

749
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,682
sequences, a lot of ways you could do it

750
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,777
and then from the align sequence matrix

751
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,427
to the tree model there's a lot of ways

752
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:20,722
to do that. It could be a bifurcating

753
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:21,932
tree, it could be like a different kind

754
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:23,242
of tree, different algorithms,

755
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:26,747
Bayesian, et cetera. One interesting

756
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:30,202
point that many have raised,

757
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:32,057
but it's very challenging to deal with

758
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,162
is that depending on how stringently you

759
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:38,812
align the sequences different Ines

760
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,487
with different histories or different

761
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,847
information content partially or in

762
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,532
totality are being filtered out in a

763
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:49,322
different way. So if you have a mode of

764
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,022
evolution where like short chunks get

765
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:54,377
interchanged so that locally the

766
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,327
sequences are not changed like domain of

767
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:57,602
a protein aren't changed but then

768
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,497
they're swapped in order, those might

769
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,302
become nonalignable sequences. And so

770
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,722
the hope is that those kinds of genomic

771
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:08,822
changes are silent with respect to the

772
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,982
longterm evolutionary history of a

773
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,067
species. But in the short term other

774
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,047
methods might be needed. But in the long

775
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,192
term it's the hope that by pulling back

776
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:18,932
the alignable sections you can get a

777
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,077
good signal. And so that's a pretty

778
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,722
satisfactory approach when multiple

779
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:27,097
converging threads do overwhelmingly

780
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:30,347
agree. But it really shows that when

781
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,197
there's like a signal processing,

782
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:35,337
filtering and then a model fitting

783
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:40,322
the information in the data can be

784
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,717
extremely powerfully misleading because

785
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,367
there's so much because you're getting

786
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:50,072
exactly the same post. Normalized data,

787
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:53,282
whether it was total noise in,

788
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:55,352
total bias out or whether your

789
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:58,322
correction process over normalized for

790
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:00,497
one thing or another, those are kind of

791
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,797
in that gray zone, unknown, unknown

792
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:05,787
space coming into the searchlight.

793
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:09,152
And so there's the whole looking at the

794
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,602
searchlight story. So maybe where do

795
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,902
we situate active inference with respect

796
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,300
to that looking where the light is

797
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:21,462
searching for one keys, etc. Etc.

798
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:25,922
Can I just say real quick, I'm not

799
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:29,025
advocating for don't show your work.

800
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,712
I believe that showing your work really

801
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:34,472
matters and then when you're trying to

802
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,812
explain what's happening at a certain

803
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,722
point, don't get stuck in,

804
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:43,357
well, this was the order of the steps

805
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,722
that I took when I showed my work. Try

806
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,927
and zoom out and try and understand what

807
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:50,925
the relationship as well. That's all

808
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:56,522
what I'm asking. Does that help being

809
00:37:56,555 --> 00:37:59,337
able to toggle back and forth?

810
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,612
So can I just jump in here for a second

811
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:05,242
and point out that we had phylogenetic

812
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:08,775
trees or we had yeah, I guess

813
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,962
they weren't called phylogenetic trees

814
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:13,592
at the time, but we've had like

815
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,752
speciation trees long before we had

816
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,617
genetics, right? So we can construct

817
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:20,862
them based on morphometric analysis.

818
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:23,747
And something that I liked in this paper

819
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:27,257
is that it really drew out

820
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:30,172
the affordance of the niche environment

821
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:33,272
with respect to implication. Because we

822
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:36,347
saw many instances of species, because

823
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,677
we did these trees when we didn't have

824
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,627
genetic information. And so we had all

825
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:43,537
of these morphometric characteristics

826
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,277
that we thought were similar. And so we

827
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,872
lumped these species together because

828
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:50,567
they must be related because they share

829
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:52,907
this morphometric feature. But in many

830
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,737
circumstances, that was not the case.

831
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,902
And so because of the similarity of the

832
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,852
niche environment or even existing in

833
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,332
the same niche, we had evolution

834
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,922
converge on this feature that was

835
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:07,427
successful in that environment. And so I

836
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,037
think here the idea of duplication and

837
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,357
the authors got into that, which I

838
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,817
thought was really cool. So the same

839
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,425
mechanism can evolve more than one time

840
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:19,492
in parallel just because of the fitting

841
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,342
to the niche. Totally agree.

842
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,602
Bleu so when I said multiple conversion

843
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,017
lines of evidence, what I was totally

844
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,172
thinking of was how genomics the

845
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,632
patterns that we get from those aligned

846
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:36,167
sequences do recapitulate and even

847
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:38,977
discover unexpected but later verified

848
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:41,402
relationships. And so that's sort of

849
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,772
like a measure of the unique

850
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,567
explanations and predictions. But this

851
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,542
tree could have been fit with phenotypic

852
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,922
characters, as you mentioned, as it was

853
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,707
for a long time and then it was just a

854
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,452
few sites in proteins and that was sort

855
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,652
of like the 1960s and 70s was fitting

856
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:01,052
with very reduced data sets and now the

857
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,147
amount of genomic data is rapidly

858
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,472
increasing. But out of the genomics

859
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,432
analysis, the action state of

860
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:11,527
phylogenetics is really just this tree

861
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:14,562
topology fit from a family of trees,

862
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:18,232
hopefully with an uncertainty associated

863
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:19,382
whether they show it like with a

864
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:21,797
bootstrap uncertainty or some other way

865
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:24,572
but then that is an artifact. Now,

866
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:26,627
there's a few cases where, like, this is

867
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,117
in and of itself interesting, like when

868
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,997
people have resolved some deep

869
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:33,242
relationships within insects or other

870
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,572
groups and then it helps structure

871
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:38,087
thinking that can later be brought out

872
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:40,762
about different traits and ecologies.

873
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:43,892
But it's like this is just a starting

874
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,352
point for thinking about evolutionary

875
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:47,475
histories. And like you said, similar

876
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:50,207
ecological or generative process

877
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,762
processes, dynamics might

878
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,002
beget increase likelihood for a certain

879
00:40:57,095 --> 00:41:00,667
generative model to arise.

880
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,542
And that's like kind of what ecosystem

881
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:06,107
is like a desert seed harvesting ant

882
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,272
whether it's in the Mediterranean or the

883
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:12,332
southwest US. Like polka miramax in

884
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,977
the US. And then cataclyphus in

885
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:18,647
the Mediterranean regions. There's some

886
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,902
similarities there but then there's

887
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:22,102
other species that are more closely

888
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,022
related that have a different foraging

889
00:41:24,142 --> 00:41:27,152
biology. So then,

890
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,482
how does the foraging strategy sometimes

891
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,992
have extreme fidelity with a group like

892
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,202
leaf cutter ants where once they're

893
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:38,302
committed to being a full leafcutter

894
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:42,377
ant, so to speak, evolution or

895
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:44,497
they haven't been observed to revert

896
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:47,222
back some other mode versus other,

897
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,217
like, foraging strategies at the group

898
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,527
level, at the colony level. But it's the

899
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:54,722
individual, in another sense that's like

900
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:57,127
very interesting thinking about foraging

901
00:41:57,157 --> 00:41:59,850
phenotypes on this tree. And why not?

902
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:02,522
Just like any other trait that you could

903
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:04,622
study like the evolution of first

904
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,942
spatial foraging and then the evolution

905
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:11,407
of cognitive foraging and then applying

906
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:13,022
that to different search spaces which

907
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:15,750
was also explored a little in the

908
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:19,502
citations here the foraging in mind and

909
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,227
foraging and semantic fields papers

910
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,532
what would you say? Bleu? So it's clear

911
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:26,792
that you brought that up, Daniel. And

912
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,392
just because in our past conversations

913
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:31,072
you've brought up that the same species

914
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:33,847
of ants can have different foraging

915
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:36,047
patterns based upon the colony that they

916
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,242
live in. I think that that's super

917
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,825
interesting and I wonder how could you

918
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:46,472
map foraging patterns? Like can you put

919
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:49,027
foraging patterns into a phylogenetic

920
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:51,407
tree? Is there a tree structure that we

921
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,377
could use to describe foraging patterns

922
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,137
and would that relate to or map onto

923
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:59,175
this brain structure tree in some way?

924
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,852
There's a lot of diversity within the

925
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,560
same brain structure. Also like the ants

926
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,992
have the same brain structure but even

927
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,657
humans have like some of us go to the

928
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,847
grocery store. Some humans out there are

929
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,282
still like hunting and gathering to

930
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,202
least their food. Awesome Dean,

931
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:21,452
go for it first so. You guys can

932
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,450
learn me school me on something here.

933
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,872
Is there any evidence that ants all

934
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,867
gather in the morning and the queen

935
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:34,262
aunt or whatever the organizing and the

936
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:37,350
principal ant pulls the map out and says

937
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:40,022
now I kant you to take this thing that

938
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:43,517
you've mapped and carry it out today.

939
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:45,652
And I'm not being a smart alec I'm

940
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:49,282
asking is there some sort of analogous

941
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:52,425
evidence that they do that?

942
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:57,992
Okay so to the team

943
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,200
huddle Monday morning stand up.

944
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:05,032
No, I hope that's not overgeneralizing

945
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:06,497
because ants are also of course very

946
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,102
diverse in their foraging strategies and

947
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,327
a lot is unknown. But just speaking to

948
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:14,597
the first approximation the queen is not

949
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,222
a central decision maker in information

950
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,297
router hormonally and at a slower time

951
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,747
scale for sure, but at the behavioral

952
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:26,552
regulation level. Now in the

953
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,147
morning for the poke and the mirmax they

954
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,197
would like, chill and some would slowly

955
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:34,652
come out and like their walking speed is

956
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,622
temperature dependent like all insects

957
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,902
and it just assessing maybe the humidity

958
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:42,812
or damage around the nest entrance. So

959
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:45,097
there's no reason why those archetypes

960
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:48,975
like convergence before planning or

961
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:51,577
rupture repair which of course cannot

962
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,932
have a planning component directly.

963
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:55,697
Different algorithms are going to have

964
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,462
different levels there.

965
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:04,597
But because the Kant symbolic

966
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:07,532
behavior communication is pretty flow

967
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,882
bandwidth probably. So unlike the waggle

968
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:12,482
dance which is conveying like quite a

969
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:13,672
lot from an information theory

970
00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:16,577
perspective using symbolic means like

971
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:18,737
the direction and the distance and also

972
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,657
chemical information like about the

973
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,387
flowers there's ants that like

974
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,982
physically pull another nest mate to a

975
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:27,947
foraging location. So using memory or

976
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,627
pheromone or like tandem run and there's

977
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:33,452
probably some limited examples of being

978
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,147
able to do something like a little bit

979
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,157
higher order signaling and also, of

980
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,582
course the smell of the food and the

981
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,417
pheromone and so a lot of the extended

982
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:43,582
features but they don't

983
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:47,702
do a powwow with the queen. Okay, so let

984
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,777
me take what you just said and sort of

985
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,132
feedback and maybe build on it a bit.

986
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:55,102
So you describe the situation. It's

987
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:59,117
morning if morning then ant behaves like

988
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:03,162
so and in the last slide of this deck

989
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:06,600
and the phylogenetic tree you had then

990
00:46:07,037 --> 00:46:10,597
to now or then if. So what I'm wondering

991
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,297
is can we exist in

992
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,402
a sequential world of if then like as a

993
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,072
homeostatic representation is if then

994
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:22,252
all we need. But if we want to include

995
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:26,287
temporal depth and hierarchical depth

996
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:29,102
we actually incorporate the inversion of

997
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,425
that. We incorporate the then if.

998
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,877
Right? So that's my question. So to

999
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,612
Blue's point earlier,

1000
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:43,607
where is this shift or this sense

1001
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:46,292
of what's going on? The relationship

1002
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,512
might be the discrepancy.

1003
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:51,977
The first representation figure on the

1004
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:54,902
discrepancy might be those people that

1005
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,567
are looking at things from an if then

1006
00:46:56,615 --> 00:47:00,452
perspective. If this then we

1007
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,152
should expect that from a predictive

1008
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:04,757
standpoint versus the then if

1009
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:08,250
perspective then

1010
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:13,862
the critical call had to be made as the

1011
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:16,817
base runner was foraging for second base

1012
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:20,537
and a call was made. Now if

1013
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,192
not a whole bunch of people chime in

1014
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,847
about what their interpretation of what

1015
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,012
just happened. Right.

1016
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,150
So again,

1017
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,362
I'm not sure if only looking at it

1018
00:47:36,425 --> 00:47:39,387
frontwards and backwards as a sequence

1019
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:41,702
is enough. I think we also have to be

1020
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,267
able to see the relationship of if then

1021
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:47,642
and then if from the historical view.

1022
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:50,325
And I think when we do that we go from

1023
00:47:50,987 --> 00:47:53,797
architectural existence to architectures

1024
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:54,450
learning.

1025
00:47:57,362 --> 00:48:00,227
Okay, let me try to restate that but

1026
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,917
I've not lost the forging trail. So if

1027
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:07,950
the outcome is like the end point

1028
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:12,127
then that's

1029
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:15,782
the if then if the person committed the

1030
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:20,642
crime you do the time and then the

1031
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,497
sort of then if it precludes if then

1032
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,297
in multiple sequences of if then and

1033
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,102
uncertainties on if thens and then it

1034
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,367
says okay then or it's like if then if.

1035
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:35,372
So we're kind of downtown if and then

1036
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,262
that's where the outcome is a starting

1037
00:48:37,325 --> 00:48:39,832
point. And so that is in one sense it's

1038
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:41,372
teleological because it's end direct.

1039
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,427
Where is this project going to go? Do we

1040
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:45,647
really expect and prefer to publish this

1041
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,622
paper on February 28? And then also it

1042
00:48:49,655 --> 00:48:52,352
includes the next steps. So it creates a

1043
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,352
world model where there is a possible

1044
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,492
which is a selectable set of policies

1045
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:00,317
that the team will achieve like that

1046
00:49:00,365 --> 00:49:02,402
expected and preferred outcome and then

1047
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,847
it sets it up for what would be the

1048
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,822
obvious next loop of policy selection.

1049
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:10,577
And so if it's like if things are this

1050
00:49:10,595 --> 00:49:12,692
good or bad with the environment in 2030

1051
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:15,077
then this is how much damage will go to

1052
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:18,107
this or this way. Even if you were right

1053
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,442
it wouldn't involve the policy selection

1054
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,677
elements. And so that's probably a

1055
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,227
complex situation with the partitioning

1056
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:28,637
of like estimation and world policy

1057
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,652
selection which is clearly a separate

1058
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:32,902
discussion that's dot one being invoked

1059
00:49:33,007 --> 00:49:35,687
as an example but it just points to how

1060
00:49:35,825 --> 00:49:37,847
those are different components of

1061
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,472
inference. And then foraging like an

1062
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:43,217
example of if then and then as if or

1063
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:46,575
then if was like sometimes

1064
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:49,027
the colonies would pack their nest

1065
00:49:49,057 --> 00:49:51,157
entrance with pebbles and then there'd

1066
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:54,302
be a thunderstorm in the afternoon. I

1067
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,282
don't think a study has ever it's a

1068
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:57,872
totally widely observed behavior with

1069
00:49:57,905 --> 00:49:59,527
many animals and there's no exception

1070
00:49:59,557 --> 00:50:01,702
with harvester ants. Now maybe there's

1071
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,872
thunderstorms where they fail to make

1072
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:07,297
pebbles or it not enough and there's

1073
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:09,632
probably some false positives too. So we

1074
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:11,927
don't really know the exact success

1075
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,882
ratio. Maybe it's better than the

1076
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,582
previous days forecast, maybe it's

1077
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:20,372
worse. But it's very clear to see that

1078
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,597
the nest mate doesn't need to have been

1079
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,252
inheriting from its evolutionary history

1080
00:50:26,345 --> 00:50:29,347
and its niche rain cloud modeling

1081
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:32,452
software. It's just picking up pebbles

1082
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:34,577
with a activity to interactions and

1083
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:38,042
humidity etc. That help colonies that

1084
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:41,147
have that proclivity succeed in that

1085
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,082
niche. Which doesn't even mean that it

1086
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:45,122
was a popular phenotype like 20 years

1087
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:47,812
ago as things change in a region.

1088
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,400
So that's like super interesting.

1089
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,127
Let's return to foraging and the

1090
00:50:55,145 --> 00:50:57,617
foraging variation question. But first,

1091
00:50:57,665 --> 00:50:59,912
let's see if we've completed the figure

1092
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:03,947
four discussion. And just

1093
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,327
like, is there anything else we want to

1094
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:07,802
add about, like the main? Because this

1095
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,802
is kind of what the paper works towards.

1096
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,972
And then there's, like, a little

1097
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:13,922
downhill role is, like, we could do this

1098
00:51:13,955 --> 00:51:16,577
algebra on the free, but this is sort of

1099
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,722
where things get led up to through

1100
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:20,627
demonstration of the motifs and the

1101
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:23,807
connection between cognition and

1102
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:26,252
structures and structured learning and

1103
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,502
then, like, parameter learning at a

1104
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,277
behavior or developmental time scale and

1105
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,982
then structure changes over evolutionary

1106
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:37,447
active states. So we have hierarchical

1107
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:39,452
depth, temporal depth, which we're also

1108
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,762
just kind of adding in a spatial

1109
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:45,197
component allostasis which was used

1110
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,792
in the paper with the intermodality.

1111
00:51:46,852 --> 00:51:49,522
But maybe it could be other modalities

1112
00:51:49,717 --> 00:51:53,327
or same. There's duplication, which is

1113
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:54,827
kind of like parallelization that's like

1114
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,427
adding another nest mate or another unit

1115
00:51:57,457 --> 00:51:59,647
to the compound eye of insect

1116
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:03,302
developmentally. And then I

1117
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:06,497
is homeostasis, which is being used here

1118
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,872
as sort of the base or

1119
00:52:09,905 --> 00:52:12,902
root or ancestral case which is

1120
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,972
referring at the behavior time scale to

1121
00:52:15,005 --> 00:52:18,707
return to a stable point. And then also

1122
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:20,302
at the more evolutionary time scale,

1123
00:52:20,332 --> 00:52:22,582
the eye operator on the homeostat, it's

1124
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,267
like the homeostasis on homeostasis.

1125
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:27,752
It's keeping the structure of that model

1126
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,202
fixed. And then when the homeostasis at

1127
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,247
the evolutionary time scale is open then

1128
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:36,602
the structural transformations here are

1129
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,422
like the affordance from that base case,

1130
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,222
which is what's being shown, like, with

1131
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,372
the main one on the left being broken

1132
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:45,467
into these. And then each of these

1133
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:47,417
become the prior for each of these next

1134
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,075
ones.

1135
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,612
Anything to add before we go to forging?

1136
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:56,550
No. Okay, no.

1137
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:02,237
Great relevant question.

1138
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,507
Bleu measuring foraging. So one paper,

1139
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,397
though, there's a bunch that are really

1140
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,477
relevant, but Michelle Dean 2014 did

1141
00:53:11,495 --> 00:53:13,757
a lot of literature review and

1142
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:17,462
visualizations of foraging strategies in

1143
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,777
different ant species. So these are like

1144
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,942
some of the foraging approaches, like

1145
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,225
foraging archetypes and then

1146
00:53:28,862 --> 00:53:32,507
categorized those into different

1147
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,062
traits on a tree.

1148
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:39,842
So that's an awesome work and something

1149
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,272
that could and should be extended and

1150
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,272
integrated with like, modern databases

1151
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:47,177
so that somebody could submit, we just

1152
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:49,277
saw this one going in a trail. And then

1153
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:50,602
that kind of reduces our uncertainty

1154
00:53:50,632 --> 00:53:54,122
about a broader model of ant

1155
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:56,402
foraging because it's like, oh, that's a

1156
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,772
surprising conversation about this given

1157
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:00,772
what we already knew about that species,

1158
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:03,287
for example. But how do you actually

1159
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,657
measure foraging variation within or

1160
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,100
across the species? So in this case,

1161
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:13,127
in figure one, these are like kind of

1162
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:16,697
like the structure at

1163
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,572
one level, they're like archetypes of

1164
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:21,077
structure. Now, sometimes they probably

1165
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,797
blur within each other. Like, if it's

1166
00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:25,982
two, then it's tandem running. But if

1167
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:27,692
it's three, is it a group or is it still

1168
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,672
like pseudo tandem running? You know,

1169
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,027
so it could be a little blurriness. And

1170
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:33,762
also, there could be different modes

1171
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:38,117
even within the same species or like in

1172
00:54:38,165 --> 00:54:40,072
a continuum between a foraging column

1173
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:42,397
with, like, a trunk and a spread versus

1174
00:54:42,442 --> 00:54:45,002
like, just a spread. So this is sort of

1175
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,272
like I've. Dot two, jump in and say,

1176
00:54:48,305 --> 00:54:50,822
like, how these look like neurons just

1177
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,502
with different axons and dendritic

1178
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:57,472
fibers. These are like different brain

1179
00:54:57,517 --> 00:54:59,552
structures. So I just had to point that

1180
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,937
out. Yeah, the bottom one definitely

1181
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,417
does. Even both of these and even this

1182
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:07,437
top one too, the trunk trail.

1183
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,877
Let's just say that these are sort of

1184
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,922
architectures within a broader space and

1185
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:22,062
then within a given mode,

1186
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,732
then the behavior ecological will tend

1187
00:55:25,747 --> 00:55:27,937
to make like a more specific measure.

1188
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:30,817
So let's just say it's 100% a trail

1189
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:34,772
forger. Then having the counts to

1190
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:38,317
and from on the trail is a good measure.

1191
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:41,222
So like in the harvest ranks they most

1192
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,052
basically do this trunk trail on the

1193
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,962
top. So there would be like one or two

1194
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:48,797
or three main avenues that they were

1195
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:51,152
leaving the colony in for that day and

1196
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,577
then sometimes it be the same day to

1197
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:54,622
day, other times it would be slightly

1198
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:57,752
different. But then what happens when

1199
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,777
one wanders off not on a trail? Is it

1200
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:02,972
still a forager? And a lot of that

1201
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:07,177
space is really interesting. But suffice

1202
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:09,352
to say that once a foraging definition

1203
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:11,297
has been selected, like not just the

1204
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,367
class that it's going to be, but also

1205
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,747
how it's gain to be measured in that

1206
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,342
study, then there can be like

1207
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,282
quantitative parameter comparisons like

1208
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,792
this colony foraged at this rate in

1209
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,952
terms of number of outgoing foragers per

1210
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:28,507
minute. And then its neighboring colony

1211
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:31,022
of the same species was doing at this

1212
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,497
rate. So you can do like parameter

1213
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,502
comparisons within the species kind of

1214
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,277
at the population level. And then there

1215
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:38,872
might be another ant species whose

1216
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,247
activity it doesn't really make to

1217
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,972
compare because it's like a different

1218
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,247
number of nest mates, it has a different

1219
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,302
foraging ecology. So that's kind of

1220
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,327
where the structure learning would come

1221
00:56:47,345 --> 00:56:50,102
into play with comparing the ants that

1222
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,072
are encoding the scale, insects versus

1223
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,412
foraging for seeds versus doing whatever

1224
00:56:55,475 --> 00:56:58,582
else they do. And then within a species

1225
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,752
or perhaps across a few species that

1226
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,727
have a similar foraging ecology, it's

1227
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,012
possible to do parametric comparisons.

1228
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,437
So I have a question for you Daniel.

1229
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,287
How does foraging fit architecture?

1230
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:27,377
What do you think? No, I Dean, I'm not

1231
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,107
trying to be a smart allocator. I'm

1232
00:57:29,122 --> 00:57:30,452
really curious because most

1233
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:34,097
architectural analogies result in some

1234
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,077
sort of an outcome that's static. Like

1235
00:57:36,095 --> 00:57:37,547
there's a lot of processing that went

1236
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,977
into the outcome but the outcome is

1237
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:41,432
static. And I don't think that any of

1238
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:44,207
the representations in the frame that

1239
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:48,047
you're moving right now, although the

1240
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,937
differences are appear as static,

1241
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:53,047
they're supposed to be representing

1242
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:56,687
something that's quite dynamic. So

1243
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,052
that's where the question of the

1244
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,347
architectures piece blended with

1245
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,857
evolution might be helpful or

1246
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,662
it might be oxymoronic depending upon

1247
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:10,725
how you interpret it. Right.

1248
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:17,357
Architecture implies like there's an

1249
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,652
architect. I don't know, in an

1250
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,607
evolutionary sense I'm not sure like

1251
00:58:22,685 --> 00:58:25,702
architecture is the right word. It's

1252
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:28,702
weird. Yeah, but I'm not saying it's

1253
00:58:28,732 --> 00:58:30,377
wrong. I'm just saying you have to be

1254
00:58:30,395 --> 00:58:33,322
really careful and then what assumptions

1255
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,747
you come in with based on what you think

1256
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,292
architecture is. Yeah, maybe you're

1257
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:40,922
thinking of the way I am. I'm not saying

1258
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:44,297
it's wrong, I'm just saying, what

1259
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,627
baggage does that carry? When we're

1260
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,137
talking about something that's actually

1261
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,262
quite dynamic.

1262
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:55,417
You can see the ants and the ant. Hill

1263
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:58,007
has an architecture. Yes, you can take a

1264
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,577
snapshot of it, but is that what we're

1265
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:01,847
really talking about when we're talking

1266
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,102
about foraging? So what's the

1267
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,752
difference between a structure and an

1268
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,600
architecture? I wonder that. Yeah.

1269
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:15,502
It'S just semantics. Yeah, I think it's

1270
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:17,402
more than that. But we just have to be

1271
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,487
careful that we don't insert

1272
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,032
one for the other, thinking that they're

1273
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:24,257
the same thing. That's what the whole

1274
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:26,657
ontology exercise is about. I mean, I

1275
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,877
got my mind changed. Okay. Normally I'm

1276
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,217
the one that argues that don't give

1277
00:59:31,265 --> 00:59:33,122
somebody an owner's manual. Get them

1278
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:36,197
behind the wheel, right? They'll see

1279
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,072
their owner's manual later. But in this

1280
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:40,082
particular case, I'm kind of going,

1281
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,002
wait a second, we better all agree what

1282
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,177
we're talking about. So here it is.

1283
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:45,577
What's the difference between structure

1284
00:59:45,607 --> 00:59:47,777
and architecture? Structure tends to be

1285
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:49,637
the pieces and the parts of the design

1286
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,677
and how it goes together and the

1287
00:59:51,695 --> 00:59:54,487
finished object. Architecture defines

1288
00:59:54,562 --> 00:59:57,422
how the final object looks, behavior and

1289
00:59:57,455 --> 01:00:01,222
costs by designating, how design choices

1290
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,602
are made. So architecture implies that

1291
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,197
there's some kind of agency behind the

1292
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,462
design. And that was kind of my

1293
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:11,475
interpretation of it also. Okay.

1294
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:16,307
Bunch of stuff. There that last point,

1295
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:18,172
like the definition of architecture

1296
01:00:18,217 --> 01:00:20,267
involves the choices rather than

1297
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:23,152
structure involving just the description

1298
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:25,412
of parts. So that's kind of like the

1299
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:27,557
perception, variational, free energy.

1300
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,487
That's like structure.

1301
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:34,657
It also means the entire thing. So it's

1302
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,227
not just the parts, it also means the

1303
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:38,902
entire object. Yes, but it still doesn't

1304
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,032
involve preferences or choices. It's

1305
01:00:41,047 --> 01:00:42,922
about description, like perceptual

1306
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:43,952
processing is. And then the

1307
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,202
architectural definition has choices in

1308
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,302
it and then that is what you brought to

1309
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,787
like agency and also architecture.

1310
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:53,522
It's like a profession and an

1311
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:56,297
operational approach to modeling the

1312
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:57,467
process of building and building,

1313
01:00:57,515 --> 01:00:59,597
though there's probably theoretical and

1314
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,042
basic architectures and all this other

1315
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,582
stuff. Okay, we're just a few thoughts

1316
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:06,752
here on like the engineering and

1317
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,187
designing. So I guess one ontology that

1318
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:14,107
can be helpful here is with Bucky Fuller

1319
01:01:14,197 --> 01:01:16,117
talking about structural integrity,

1320
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,217
which is something that has static

1321
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:22,097
holding strength, like a metal cube has

1322
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,777
static holding strength. Then there's

1323
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,622
process or the pattern integrity, which

1324
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:30,317
is sort of like describing the life

1325
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:31,952
cycle of the butterfly and the

1326
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,177
caterpillar, like a recapitulation of

1327
01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:38,447
process. And that is

1328
01:01:38,555 --> 01:01:40,747
a lot more like this sort of dynamic

1329
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:45,762
systems approach to organization

1330
01:01:46,112 --> 01:01:48,677
rather than the build it and block it

1331
01:01:48,845 --> 01:01:50,422
approach because these multiscale

1332
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:51,752
systems always have things that are

1333
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,462
turning over at different timescales.

1334
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,102
And then there's just so many mechanisms

1335
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,992
that that can be modeled by or actually

1336
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,772
occurs by. Like just in the harvester

1337
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:07,307
ants. It's the historiosity of that

1338
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,327
colony over the years, then the nest

1339
01:02:10,357 --> 01:02:12,847
mate and that day. And it's visual

1340
01:02:12,892 --> 01:02:16,427
memory and just how many factors come

1341
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,182
into play then every foraging trip at

1342
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:19,502
the nest mate level could be seen as

1343
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,472
unique and the exact communication will

1344
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,277
just never be recapitulated. Some of the

1345
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:28,292
major ones can be explore and then

1346
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,122
controlled for, tested for in a lab.

1347
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:33,377
But that's part of the openendedness of

1348
01:02:33,395 --> 01:02:36,152
dynamics systems because by changing the

1349
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,532
setting, you can study certain features.

1350
01:02:39,697 --> 01:02:42,292
But then it's another step that's

1351
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:45,797
impossible in practice to understand how

1352
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,192
those features that were in a different

1353
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,397
environment translate to the first

1354
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,497
environment. So you can take the

1355
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:53,677
essential behavior of the traffic jam

1356
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:55,157
and then recapitulate it with the

1357
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,272
simulation and the lab experiment and

1358
01:02:57,305 --> 01:02:59,822
all this. But it's a different thing to

1359
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:02,642
actually put it into the design time,

1360
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,277
which is happening at a different time

1361
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:06,022
scale than just building the skyscraper

1362
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:08,027
and leaving it there. But that's more

1363
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:09,987
like the dynamic organism.

1364
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:17,250
So where's foraging on this?

1365
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,072
And I would ask, is there a different

1366
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:24,962
kind of forging? If we're talking about

1367
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,937
sort of the sort of the machine learning

1368
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,912
type of foraging on this versus the wet

1369
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:36,600
foraging of an ant,

1370
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:40,877
can we actually see those two things

1371
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,517
being quite different in terms of how

1372
01:03:43,565 --> 01:03:46,500
those two foraging types plays out? Or

1373
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:50,777
do we focus on the things that are

1374
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:52,202
different about those two things? Or do

1375
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,872
we focus on the things that are the same

1376
01:03:54,905 --> 01:03:56,937
about those two types of foraging?

1377
01:03:58,562 --> 01:04:01,772
Bleu also with your foraging from a more

1378
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:04,812
culture and human perspective,

1379
01:04:05,612 --> 01:04:08,412
social machine learning and foraging.

1380
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:16,212
So machine learning and foraging,

1381
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:18,997
I've done some modeling of foraging

1382
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:23,267
with, like, agency modeling. But in

1383
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:26,325
machine learning, I wonder, like,

1384
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:28,607
I mean, I know that there's information

1385
01:04:28,685 --> 01:04:30,647
forging but that's usually explore from

1386
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,782
the human concept, right? Like humans

1387
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:33,887
going out and looking for information

1388
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,132
and how long we stay on the website.

1389
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,302
And so but I

1390
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,582
wonder about machine learning and neural

1391
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:46,287
networks doing object classification.

1392
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:49,922
Is there a foraging that they do there?

1393
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,482
Like, you know, they pick up things

1394
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,847
like, Chris Ola wrote

1395
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:58,772
a really awesome publication about how

1396
01:04:58,805 --> 01:05:00,872
we understand how neural networks work.

1397
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:02,347
And they kind of deconstruct a deep

1398
01:05:02,392 --> 01:05:04,877
dream that's onto Still Club, which is

1399
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:07,292
really cool. It was like a 2018 paper.

1400
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,552
But they look at how does a neural

1401
01:05:10,582 --> 01:05:12,750
network recognize a dog,

1402
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:16,202
a dog in a tennis ball? So they look for

1403
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,427
like, round object and like, you know,

1404
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,662
floppy ear. So there's like different

1405
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:24,337
neurons in the neural network that'll

1406
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,777
learn what is a floppy ear or learn what

1407
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:29,522
is like a round object. And so it's this

1408
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:31,607
combination of different things that the

1409
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,977
neural network learns that piece

1410
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:35,777
together to form. Like, this is a dog

1411
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:38,537
with a tennis ball, which is a super

1412
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,427
interesting way to think about it. And I

1413
01:05:40,445 --> 01:05:42,912
wonder, in training a neural network,

1414
01:05:44,312 --> 01:05:47,087
can that be looked at as a type of

1415
01:05:47,225 --> 01:05:48,977
information foraging, right? Like the

1416
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,457
network is setting out to learn distinct

1417
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:54,000
pieces of a pattern that it'll later

1418
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:58,252
piece together to make it complete image

1419
01:05:58,282 --> 01:06:01,942
recognition. So it's

1420
01:06:02,002 --> 01:06:05,627
interesting. I'll give a

1421
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,147
thought on the machine learning and the

1422
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,075
bio origin. So you mentioned

1423
01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:14,777
there's the question of should we

1424
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:16,202
approach it from a similarities or a

1425
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,827
different perspective? And there's

1426
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:19,177
different reasons why you might approach

1427
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,477
different angles. Right. Like what is

1428
01:06:20,495 --> 01:06:22,442
the most pedagogical to someone learning

1429
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:24,302
about the difference versus what is the

1430
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,012
best way to approach this to a certain

1431
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,952
stakeholder, who is actually applying

1432
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:31,547
this question in a certain context? But

1433
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,900
to get to the question outside of that,

1434
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:37,607
the idea of contrast came to mind

1435
01:06:37,685 --> 01:06:40,297
because we recently had the model stream

1436
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,917
on contrastive Active Inference, which

1437
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,962
used machine learning. So check out that

1438
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,097
stream, but it involved a contrasting

1439
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:51,587
step of processing inputs before doing

1440
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,362
policy selection, etc. So that helps

1441
01:06:55,937 --> 01:06:58,277
scenes that are broadly similar but have

1442
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,702
a key difference that's small, like

1443
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,502
where the ping pong ball is can be

1444
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,107
learnt better because there's a

1445
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,427
contrasting and that reminds me of

1446
01:07:04,445 --> 01:07:07,437
language learning when it's like here's

1447
01:07:08,312 --> 01:07:11,497
and here's and then that's a contrast

1448
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:12,707
that isn't going to come up in the

1449
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,522
language, but then it helps learn on

1450
01:07:14,555 --> 01:07:16,927
that. And that's not just a machine

1451
01:07:16,957 --> 01:07:19,187
learning thing because even in the

1452
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,777
parametric modeling of SPM,

1453
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:26,722
statistical parametric modeling mapping,

1454
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,025
but the model making of it,

1455
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:33,127
the contrast matrix is the experimental

1456
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:35,252
design. And so if it's just condition A

1457
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,497
and cognition B and you have ten

1458
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,897
measurements, it's just five of a five

1459
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,972
zeros and five ones. And that's like the

1460
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,522
true or false matrix that basically gets

1461
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:47,222
multiplied to do statistics on. So

1462
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:49,777
whether it's a very classical,

1463
01:07:49,882 --> 01:07:52,867
parametric, sparse modeling approach,

1464
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:55,772
which was initially all that was had by

1465
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,577
statisticians, or whether it is now

1466
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,017
things that are highly parametric,

1467
01:08:02,152 --> 01:08:03,997
or just all this other stuff with modern

1468
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,152
machine learning, the contrast is like

1469
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,122
this key piece because it's always about

1470
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:12,002
what signals being detected within a

1471
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,072
data set and then also how the

1472
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:16,352
difference between that examples and the

1473
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,902
population is being modeled. And so like

1474
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,672
in parametric statistics that's about

1475
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:23,102
the sample standard deviation. And then

1476
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,292
there's a slightly different equation

1477
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:25,967
for, like, the population standard

1478
01:08:26,015 --> 01:08:27,677
deviation if you would have kept on

1479
01:08:27,695 --> 01:08:29,762
sampling. And then it's also sometimes

1480
01:08:29,825 --> 01:08:31,892
hard to incorporate that kind of

1481
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:35,362
reasoning into these more modern

1482
01:08:35,437 --> 01:08:37,517
statistical systems where it's, like,

1483
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:40,082
very easy to overfit because there's a

1484
01:08:40,085 --> 01:08:41,702
lot of data, but it's hard to model how

1485
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,517
that large chunk of data is related to

1486
01:08:43,565 --> 01:08:46,507
even other segments of data. So it's

1487
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,277
similar to the phylogenetic challenge.

1488
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:50,602
But that is one that is like searching

1489
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:52,292
for contrast. Takes on a very different

1490
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,037
meaning.

1491
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:58,962
But how is it related to foraging?

1492
01:09:03,212 --> 01:09:05,317
There's the info foraging like Bleu

1493
01:09:05,452 --> 01:09:08,852
mentioned. There's the path element of

1494
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,517
foraging which might be related to

1495
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:13,477
inferring the best info foraging path

1496
01:09:13,507 --> 01:09:15,902
for somebody on their feed because it

1497
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,632
has to balance the Epistemic and the

1498
01:09:18,635 --> 01:09:21,002
Pragmatic. Or at least it acts as if it

1499
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,382
balances the Epistemic and the

1500
01:09:22,385 --> 01:09:26,222
Pragmatic. So foraging could be

1501
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:28,350
maybe looked at in that way.

1502
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:36,647
I think what this slide represents is

1503
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,697
broadly speaking, not just or broadly

1504
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,427
identity. I think what we do

1505
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,602
is in that diagram, we tend to

1506
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,972
differentiate. We see the levels because

1507
01:09:48,005 --> 01:09:49,812
we've created the partitions.

1508
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:54,257
We see the dependencies because over on

1509
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,347
the far left we have actually Bleu

1510
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,197
arrows that show what those dependencies

1511
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,662
are and then we reintegrate,

1512
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:05,852
right? I remember when I was doing my

1513
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,652
I come back to the program that I was

1514
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,632
doing, but I would say to the kids, I

1515
01:10:09,635 --> 01:10:11,927
mean, there's a migration piece to this

1516
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:13,577
that we have to develop, which I would

1517
01:10:13,595 --> 01:10:15,617
consider to be the tactics, which would

1518
01:10:15,665 --> 01:10:18,032
include foraging. And then there's a

1519
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:21,077
tools use or a strategy piece, which is

1520
01:10:21,095 --> 01:10:23,372
sort of the information covered as

1521
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:25,352
changed as measured, which is kind of

1522
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:29,077
the instrument piece. And what I kept

1523
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:31,397
saying to them was you kind of need to

1524
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,752
have both all the time. You don't need

1525
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,167
to know the difference between something

1526
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:39,537
that's a migration or an action

1527
01:10:40,037 --> 01:10:42,152
or a fulfillment in the sort of the

1528
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,272
physical space and the tools sort of the

1529
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:47,147
thinking instrumental parts where you

1530
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,042
can turn what you're seeing into these

1531
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,327
models and these representations. You

1532
01:10:53,345 --> 01:10:55,472
have to kind of be able to marry the two

1533
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:56,657
of them all the time. You have to be

1534
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:59,522
able to integrate them across these

1535
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,142
boundary when you're trying to get into

1536
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,525
these professional settings. Now, that

1537
01:11:03,887 --> 01:11:07,477
isn't a construction exercise. That's

1538
01:11:07,507 --> 01:11:09,427
being creative because you really don't

1539
01:11:09,457 --> 01:11:11,317
know at the end of the day how it's

1540
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:14,372
going to turn out. But the big point

1541
01:11:14,405 --> 01:11:16,387
that we were trying to make was don't

1542
01:11:16,462 --> 01:11:19,082
leave one of those two things behind.

1543
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,177
Like don't get stuck because you can't

1544
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:24,847
go out and forage don't get stuck

1545
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,672
because you don't think you can draw the

1546
01:11:26,705 --> 01:11:29,417
perfect representation of the world.

1547
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,372
It's just an instrument, right? I mean,

1548
01:11:32,405 --> 01:11:34,847
even a spoon can eventually drain an

1549
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,067
ocean if you're prepared to spend enough

1550
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:40,517
time on it. So I think that's what this

1551
01:11:40,565 --> 01:11:43,382
representation I think that's one of the

1552
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,037
greatest gifts of this representation

1553
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:47,377
is. It kind of lays out very clearly

1554
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:49,982
that there's two parts to this. How do

1555
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:53,917
we differentiate eventually

1556
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,122
on different duplication,

1557
01:11:56,317 --> 01:11:59,937
parallelization dependency

1558
01:12:01,112 --> 01:12:05,087
predictability, preferential time

1559
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:08,317
based and spatial based and then scale

1560
01:12:08,377 --> 01:12:11,597
based and then reintegrate it all back

1561
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,662
together into some sort of a coherency?

1562
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:15,727
For some people, though, I think it's

1563
01:12:15,757 --> 01:12:18,122
kind of dense. I mean, if you walked in

1564
01:12:18,155 --> 01:12:20,507
today, gee, I don't know what kind of

1565
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,977
prerequisites you would need, what kind

1566
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:23,957
of priors you would need to understand

1567
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:26,042
what the heck we're talking about. But

1568
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:28,577
as I said, for me, the entry point, the

1569
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:31,892
lowest level, was do you migrate? Do you

1570
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:35,252
tool use? Most people already admit they

1571
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,697
can find examples when they do both. So

1572
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:40,397
my question then would be, so will you

1573
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,767
know that you're doing both going

1574
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,947
forward? And if you can do that, maybe

1575
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:49,867
it's not quite. So quite so dense

1576
01:12:50,002 --> 01:12:53,187
or quite so mystifying.

1577
01:12:56,687 --> 01:13:00,317
So a few things. There so great

1578
01:13:00,365 --> 01:13:04,282
point that going foraging on your merry

1579
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:07,875
way without having all hidden states

1580
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:11,447
learnt at the structural level or

1581
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,282
the parametric level, even conditioned

1582
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:15,197
on a structure. So you don't even know

1583
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,762
what's out there. No cognitive agent

1584
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:20,102
does. And at the structural and the

1585
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,507
parametric level, the inference

1586
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:24,442
challenge is about action selection

1587
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:27,817
under uncertainty of multiple types.

1588
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:31,587
The inference challenge is of action

1589
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:34,282
having subproblems involving inference

1590
01:13:34,297 --> 01:13:36,602
on perception and causal modeling. But

1591
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,192
those are like little subproblems within

1592
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,477
a broader frame that active inference

1593
01:13:40,507 --> 01:13:42,612
provides of like action prediction,

1594
01:13:42,962 --> 01:13:45,347
action on policy selection. And then

1595
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,867
foraging is a great setting to study

1596
01:13:47,915 --> 01:13:50,527
policy selection. And then you brought

1597
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:52,427
up like that. There's prerequisites that

1598
01:13:52,445 --> 01:13:54,572
we hope to learn what different

1599
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:56,977
backgrounds can come to active inference

1600
01:13:57,007 --> 01:14:00,032
from. But I think one takeaway from the

1601
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:04,327
paper would be that perhaps archaic

1602
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,937
in a foraging structure,

1603
01:14:07,187 --> 01:14:09,947
whatever that means. But the way that we

1604
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,107
forage through linguistic and idea space

1605
01:14:12,185 --> 01:14:15,047
and solution space, strategy space can

1606
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,852
be modeled by some graph motifs and

1607
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,682
classes and transformations, which is

1608
01:14:19,685 --> 01:14:22,142
what the contribution of this paper is.

1609
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,572
And they also describe some of the more

1610
01:14:24,605 --> 01:14:26,572
basal or homeostatic ancestral

1611
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:28,832
structures. So it's like you have a

1612
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:30,872
linear model that works for height data

1613
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,227
and it works for weight data and it

1614
01:14:33,245 --> 01:14:35,132
works for height and weight together.

1615
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,782
It's just any numbers you pass to the

1616
01:14:36,785 --> 01:14:39,182
linear model, the GLM, it's going to be

1617
01:14:39,335 --> 01:14:41,657
basically okay, this is like another

1618
01:14:41,735 --> 01:14:46,127
model class that can take or apply to

1619
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:48,922
cognitive modeling, homeostatic

1620
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,472
modeling, cognitive and homeostatic

1621
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:54,002
modeling, all these variations that are

1622
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,687
being described here. So that's just one

1623
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,077
way to put it with perhaps fewer

1624
01:14:59,182 --> 01:15:01,877
prerequisites. And then these were

1625
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:04,772
interactions questions. Is this what it

1626
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,947
was? Do you migrate and do you use

1627
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,252
tools? Yeah. So when

1628
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,872
you're talking about tools, are you

1629
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:15,825
talking about provisions? And especially

1630
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:20,402
if you come to breakfast with a plan on

1631
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,327
how to build a spoon, how is that going

1632
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:26,777
to help you eat your cereal when your

1633
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:29,627
foraging exercise was to be able to move

1634
01:15:29,645 --> 01:15:31,877
the cereal from the bowl into your

1635
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:34,442
mouth? Right? So lots of times,

1636
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,600
especially in some of the more

1637
01:15:37,187 --> 01:15:39,497
conventional ways we look at things, we

1638
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:43,177
tend to take the plan to the cereal

1639
01:15:43,207 --> 01:15:45,827
bowl instead of the actual spoon. So the

1640
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:48,225
provisioning part is more than a plan,

1641
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:51,077
it's more than the words and it's more

1642
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:53,027
action oriented representation. It's the

1643
01:15:53,045 --> 01:15:55,877
actual implements that we carry with us

1644
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:58,772
when we do that migration that I think

1645
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,277
really counts. Because if you carry, I

1646
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:04,127
guess you can origami a sheet of paper

1647
01:16:04,295 --> 01:16:07,357
into a spoon, but then that's

1648
01:16:07,372 --> 01:16:09,047
another process that you have to go

1649
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,132
through. But really what you wanted was

1650
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,212
just to have the implement.

1651
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:20,637
So when you talk about migration,

1652
01:16:21,587 --> 01:16:24,697
how far is a migration? Like if you're

1653
01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:27,817
a single cell organism, like migrating

1654
01:16:27,877 --> 01:16:29,112
through the ocean.

1655
01:16:31,637 --> 01:16:33,527
Maybe the migration in that case is

1656
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:36,857
moving around. You right. You don't have

1657
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:39,152
to think migration in terms of me from A

1658
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,422
to B. If I'm stationary and A to B are

1659
01:16:42,455 --> 01:16:48,452
passing by me when

1660
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,132
the car beside me is pulling out of the

1661
01:16:50,135 --> 01:16:52,337
learning lot, I feel like I'm moving

1662
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,262
forward. Right. That's also a migration.

1663
01:16:57,887 --> 01:17:02,252
So that is related to what

1664
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,302
we talked about with some of the

1665
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,617
geometry, like the projective geometry

1666
01:17:05,677 --> 01:17:07,202
and how there's the flipping between the

1667
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,202
egocentric geometric projection where

1668
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,777
it's like your peri personal space and

1669
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,217
it's kind of like a distribution around

1670
01:17:13,265 --> 01:17:14,972
you. Like there's me in the center or

1671
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,052
located somewhere. And then there's

1672
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:20,237
like, things closer to the eyes are

1673
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,507
generated to be bigger because they

1674
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:24,802
don't leave to be because we know we're

1675
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:26,717
making the generative model anyway. So

1676
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:28,277
why does it happen? Why can't I see it

1677
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:30,827
from Grand Theft Auto perspective? It is

1678
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:33,347
a certain way for a certain reason. So

1679
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,337
then that is flipping.

1680
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,962
That's flipping with the more,

1681
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:44,062
like objective or D personalized

1682
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:45,602
stance, like the prior on the

1683
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,597
architecture structurally in my room

1684
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,697
with a right angle. And even if it looks

1685
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,602
different than a 90 degree angle in the

1686
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,657
generative models, that's perceived as

1687
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,602
normal or unsurprising because it's

1688
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:59,167
compatible with the underlying

1689
01:17:59,302 --> 01:18:01,837
structural hypothesis that's unobserved.

1690
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:03,892
And then the observed structural

1691
01:18:03,952 --> 01:18:05,972
observation that has to do with the

1692
01:18:06,005 --> 01:18:09,000
actual way that the angles look.

1693
01:18:10,712 --> 01:18:14,537
So here's just one other kind of

1694
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,222
Professor Gordon shout out angle to look

1695
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:20,447
into evolution of algorithms for

1696
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,507
collective behavior. So let's connect

1697
01:18:23,585 --> 01:18:27,442
this to the cognition foraging

1698
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,702
and then Dean's questions. Do you

1699
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,472
migrate? Do you use tools? And do you

1700
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:34,342
provision? So that's like related

1701
01:18:34,402 --> 01:18:36,150
questions. So that one might be like,

1702
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:39,452
how do you adapt when things change and

1703
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:45,362
you can't adjust certain things. Or also

1704
01:18:45,425 --> 01:18:47,327
the difference between, like, let's just

1705
01:18:47,345 --> 01:18:49,127
say I'm using a software I'm not very

1706
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:51,902
familiar with, like Photoshop between

1707
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:54,902
doing one move photoshop searching on

1708
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,032
the search engine. How do I paste okay,

1709
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,177
paste. Okay, I do one move. So it's like

1710
01:18:59,195 --> 01:19:02,602
a one step model of function versus

1711
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,637
someone who just rolls out of bed,

1712
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:06,647
opens up Photoshop, and then they just

1713
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,852
open their mind to being creative and

1714
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,172
being in feedback with what they

1715
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:12,547
actually do. And maybe that does involve

1716
01:19:12,592 --> 01:19:14,377
still using a search engine, but they're

1717
01:19:14,407 --> 01:19:16,277
in a functional flow with respect to

1718
01:19:16,295 --> 01:19:18,647
that tool and they've just set aside the

1719
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,307
time so that their regime of attention

1720
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:23,402
can be, like, productive or aligned with

1721
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,047
a project. But they're not going step by

1722
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,392
step. They're engaged in broader

1723
01:19:29,527 --> 01:19:30,462
organization.

1724
01:19:35,462 --> 01:19:37,592
So we're talking about figuring out part

1725
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,152
rather than the finding out. That's what

1726
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,012
you just described the difference

1727
01:19:41,075 --> 01:19:44,047
between those two things. Yeah. Opening

1728
01:19:44,092 --> 01:19:47,092
space for figuring out, for figuring

1729
01:19:47,152 --> 01:19:51,952
out. And that's sort of like it's

1730
01:19:51,982 --> 01:19:55,177
a little bit like local and more measle,

1731
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,277
or global foraging, which is like you

1732
01:19:58,295 --> 01:20:00,902
can dig in a given patch of dirt, so

1733
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,797
it's super labor intensive. But it's a

1734
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:07,887
local finding of what is there versus

1735
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:10,477
trying to find a better Dutch of dirt

1736
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,242
and dig their first seed, maybe even

1737
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:15,422
find an exposed seed. But whether one of

1738
01:20:15,455 --> 01:20:17,477
those policies has a higher risk of

1739
01:20:17,495 --> 01:20:19,802
reward or energy expenditure that's gain

1740
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,697
to depend a dot one what one believes

1741
01:20:21,742 --> 01:20:24,997
about the frequency of like half emerged

1742
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:28,097
seeds and seeds in this location and the

1743
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,807
time cost of moving from location to

1744
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,702
location. There's just a ton of features

1745
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:33,527
and it's not just like as simple as

1746
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:35,002
making a heat map of where the seeds

1747
01:20:35,032 --> 01:20:35,625
are.

1748
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:41,302
We would describe it as mimic foraging

1749
01:20:41,332 --> 01:20:44,852
and mimic foraging and what

1750
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:48,387
was the other one modify foraging.

1751
01:20:49,937 --> 01:20:52,487
Some people might believe that for it.

1752
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,847
So it's interesting at active inference

1753
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,675
I was at last week, they talked about

1754
01:20:58,037 --> 01:21:00,307
how far can you get mimicking an expert

1755
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,092
and there were several talks. So whether

1756
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,892
it's navigating a maze or figuring

1757
01:21:06,952 --> 01:21:10,052
out whatever so like they'll train a

1758
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:12,452
model on a whole bunch of expert, what

1759
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:15,047
would an expert do? And then they set

1760
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,737
them loose in like a novel circumstance

1761
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:19,367
and if the novel circumstance is similar

1762
01:21:19,415 --> 01:21:21,737
enough, it kind of works. But really,

1763
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,197
like, the better thing to do is to put

1764
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:26,942
some exploratory components in there so,

1765
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,222
you know, you have, like, the expert

1766
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:30,472
training. But if there's an explorer

1767
01:21:30,517 --> 01:21:32,657
component about, that doesn't leave to

1768
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,007
do with an expert or, like, you know,

1769
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,477
if you train it to navigate its own

1770
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:37,447
maze, also sometimes, like, alternating

1771
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:41,122
with its own maze or image with experts

1772
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:43,747
in it. So like following the experts

1773
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:46,922
only gets you so far. And I wonder, and

1774
01:21:46,955 --> 01:21:48,557
something that's come to really mean a

1775
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,082
lot to me in the field of intelligence

1776
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:55,027
is when there's information.

1777
01:21:55,132 --> 01:21:56,822
Like when you can do something new,

1778
01:21:56,855 --> 01:21:58,927
when you can generative, model, solve

1779
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,332
any image because you learning from a

1780
01:22:00,335 --> 01:22:04,052
few experts that's innovative or the

1781
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:05,477
ability to generalize, but also the

1782
01:22:05,495 --> 01:22:08,297
ability to innovate and produce some new

1783
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,902
output rather than just do what the

1784
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,175
experts do.

1785
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:16,832
So one thought that's awesome.

1786
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:20,147
Comments Bleu like learning from

1787
01:22:20,255 --> 01:22:22,457
examples and from experts usually

1788
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:24,857
learning by example when used not in a

1789
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,822
malicious way is referring to seeing

1790
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:28,907
somebody who is better or least

1791
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:32,267
adequate, if not far, far better.

1792
01:22:32,465 --> 01:22:34,425
And then there's this question of like

1793
01:22:35,837 --> 01:22:38,542
should it be shown only at the expert

1794
01:22:38,602 --> 01:22:42,667
level? Because the expert speaker

1795
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:46,102
would do tongue twisters and Russian

1796
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:48,825
sentences with five conjugations. But

1797
01:22:49,187 --> 01:22:52,232
the expert in interaction is able to

1798
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:54,902
approach a zone of agreement and of like

1799
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,277
proximal development so that the example

1800
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:01,727
and the expertise as applied is in a

1801
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,502
very specific space and that's like the

1802
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,622
order of examples and then knowledge

1803
01:23:06,742 --> 01:23:08,747
this person is able to conjugate this

1804
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,902
thing. But they're having challenge in

1805
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,147
conjugating this case. So then depending

1806
01:23:13,192 --> 01:23:15,052
on their personality, maybe you lean

1807
01:23:15,082 --> 01:23:16,202
more on the one that they are more

1808
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,827
familiar with or maybe they come to you

1809
01:23:18,845 --> 01:23:21,617
to be wrong. So there's a lot of

1810
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:23,477
advanced cognitive modeling and

1811
01:23:23,495 --> 01:23:25,157
parameters that could be in a

1812
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,632
fullfledged model because that's a super

1813
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,287
complex scenario, especially in a group

1814
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,252
and all of these relationships on

1815
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:35,747
relationships. And we

1816
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:39,607
don't need to have that whole generative

1817
01:23:39,697 --> 01:23:43,667
process model to have a generative model

1818
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:46,502
of policy that can be effective at

1819
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,877
foraging in that space. So it

1820
01:23:49,895 --> 01:23:53,617
is a project and making that map

1821
01:23:53,677 --> 01:23:56,732
is helpful for it. But to make policy

1822
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,677
decisions in the cognitive space isn't

1823
01:23:59,707 --> 01:24:02,072
the same as describing and mastering all

1824
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,050
the variables of the cognition process.

1825
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:07,672
And so this mental foraging and physical

1826
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:09,497
foraging and also what we talked about

1827
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:12,847
with a sensory motor detachment helps

1828
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:15,150
make that really clear.

1829
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:24,175
How does active inference model

1830
01:24:25,362 --> 01:24:27,187
relevant expertise,

1831
01:24:29,262 --> 01:24:32,737
whether domain expertise or discipline,

1832
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:36,357
like a set of affordances A versus a

1833
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,082
whole different set of affordances, you

1834
01:24:38,085 --> 01:24:41,342
know, B or expertise

1835
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:43,632
like in that language learning example

1836
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:46,002
or some other example where it's not

1837
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:49,667
simply about providing some advanced

1838
01:24:49,727 --> 01:24:52,172
example and then having people asymptote

1839
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:55,512
to that. It's about opening the space

1840
01:24:55,575 --> 01:24:59,587
for figuring out in that setting.

1841
01:25:06,912 --> 01:25:08,597
I think you can find a structural

1842
01:25:08,642 --> 01:25:12,342
adaptation in mimicking an expert and

1843
01:25:12,465 --> 01:25:14,772
that typically sort of plays itself out

1844
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:17,172
as instructionalism. I think you can

1845
01:25:17,205 --> 01:25:20,927
find yourself also modifying

1846
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:23,922
your niche and adapting in that way and

1847
01:25:23,955 --> 01:25:26,172
then being able to go back and have an

1848
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:29,427
expert look at what you've done. And the

1849
01:25:29,445 --> 01:25:30,777
reason why they're an expert in that

1850
01:25:30,795 --> 01:25:32,252
particular case isn't because you're

1851
01:25:32,282 --> 01:25:34,502
going to mimic them, but because you're

1852
01:25:34,532 --> 01:25:38,052
going to ask them what they Hohwy,

1853
01:25:38,145 --> 01:25:40,527
the process that they use to arrive at,

1854
01:25:40,545 --> 01:25:43,162
where they have a certain subject

1855
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:47,217
confidence. They are able to now

1856
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:51,037
diagnose where your confidences

1857
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:54,702
might exist and where you might want

1858
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,572
to might want to re examine what

1859
01:25:58,605 --> 01:26:00,867
the probabilities and preferences were

1860
01:26:00,915 --> 01:26:03,597
that got you to the conclusions that you

1861
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:07,752
drew. So again,

1862
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,677
you're going to adapt either way. But I

1863
01:26:10,695 --> 01:26:13,347
think that the path that you choose

1864
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:15,477
matters and knowing which path that you

1865
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:18,377
chose also matters. So I adapted,

1866
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:20,517
right? I adaptive because I'm now

1867
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:24,122
trained up to be able to find the Bleu

1868
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:27,747
dot, the Bleu ball in the sea of

1869
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:31,647
plastic balls, right? That's one form of

1870
01:26:31,755 --> 01:26:34,932
adapting because I've never been in a

1871
01:26:34,935 --> 01:26:36,927
ball pit before and now I found the one

1872
01:26:36,945 --> 01:26:39,612
that I was looking for. But another

1873
01:26:39,675 --> 01:26:42,387
person could go in there and be able to

1874
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:45,752
maybe do something else with that Bleu

1875
01:26:45,782 --> 01:26:48,702
ball because they modified the frame and

1876
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,287
the mesh and that's that.

1877
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,032
Again, we just want to make sure that we

1878
01:26:55,035 --> 01:26:56,862
know that there's a difference so that

1879
01:26:56,925 --> 01:26:59,322
when we are reintegrating them at some

1880
01:26:59,355 --> 01:27:01,692
point in the future, we know how we got

1881
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,400
there. That's all.

1882
01:27:08,262 --> 01:27:09,025
Okay.

1883
01:27:13,137 --> 01:27:17,012
I like the throwback to instructionalism

1884
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:20,157
and interactionism. It's an example. It

1885
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,137
was like latently there when talking

1886
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,657
about that niche dependence and the

1887
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,325
cocreation. So all these kind of terms

1888
01:27:27,687 --> 01:27:29,802
digital stigma, g when working online,

1889
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:33,122
for examples, become implicit when we're

1890
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:36,642
using a given sequence to be talking

1891
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:37,977
about like a certain thing that we want

1892
01:27:37,995 --> 01:27:39,852
to call our attention to. We call our

1893
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,897
attention to some example or to some

1894
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:46,227
relationship and then that modifies our

1895
01:27:46,245 --> 01:27:48,567
cognition model so that we're thinking

1896
01:27:48,615 --> 01:27:49,872
about things and doing things

1897
01:27:49,905 --> 01:27:53,172
differently after. And so it's kind of

1898
01:27:53,205 --> 01:27:56,157
like quality of engagement rather than

1899
01:27:56,235 --> 01:28:00,475
quantity because some people by

1900
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:04,727
reading a little, change a lot and vice

1901
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:07,977
versa try to set up the relationship. I

1902
01:28:07,995 --> 01:28:10,750
think it's funny that you bring up

1903
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:14,500
learning. So for a very long time

1904
01:28:15,162 --> 01:28:18,297
my PhD advisor never read anything.

1905
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,782
She would never read anything. Did she

1906
01:28:19,785 --> 01:28:23,322
read it? She does like

1907
01:28:23,355 --> 01:28:25,347
speed reads. She's speed reads, right?

1908
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,312
Which means she looks at every third

1909
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,627
word and then when she really sits down

1910
01:28:30,645 --> 01:28:31,902
to read it, she's got all these things

1911
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,207
to say about it and wants to like, you

1912
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:35,507
know, wordsmith every sentence and it's

1913
01:28:35,522 --> 01:28:37,242
great. We've had a lot of fun working

1914
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:38,877
together. I don't mean to make that

1915
01:28:38,895 --> 01:28:42,977
sound evil in any way, I don't speed

1916
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:45,617
read. I read fast. But I'm totally

1917
01:28:45,677 --> 01:28:47,502
incapable of speed reading because I

1918
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,947
feel like I have to duplicate my

1919
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:52,782
efforts. Like if I skim it like I can

1920
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,602
pick up some headings or whatever but I

1921
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,677
never really dot two read it. If I kant

1922
01:28:58,695 --> 01:29:00,072
to read something, I want to really read

1923
01:29:00,105 --> 01:29:01,827
it, like go through it line by line by

1924
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:03,252
line and look up things, I don't know

1925
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:05,127
what they mean and this kind of thing.

1926
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,797
So it's a different and interesting

1927
01:29:07,905 --> 01:29:09,692
approach how different people approach

1928
01:29:09,752 --> 01:29:11,275
things in different ways.

1929
01:29:13,062 --> 01:29:16,872
Yeah, you know, talking about in

1930
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:20,217
this paper how we've been going

1931
01:29:20,265 --> 01:29:22,197
between the sort of physiological and

1932
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:26,217
biological substrate of cognition and

1933
01:29:26,265 --> 01:29:27,927
the nervous system and the brain and all

1934
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:30,092
of that. And then this more cognition

1935
01:29:30,152 --> 01:29:32,922
modeling approach which can be sort of

1936
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:36,417
cut and dry or overly computational or

1937
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,517
so called unrealistic with respect to

1938
01:29:38,565 --> 01:29:41,157
biological foundations. It's kind of

1939
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,792
like what Dean pointed to is like the

1940
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,982
bifurcation and so now things are kind

1941
01:29:44,985 --> 01:29:46,600
of coming together,

1942
01:29:48,237 --> 01:29:49,947
not in the way that everyone might have

1943
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:53,502
expected, but at least in a way and

1944
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,757
so that's a very interesting space and

1945
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,297
then Bleu with a fast and slow reading.

1946
01:29:59,492 --> 01:30:02,927
It's almost like there are multi

1947
01:30:02,957 --> 01:30:05,437
scale dynamics associated with attention

1948
01:30:06,537 --> 01:30:09,597
that can be measured with the EEG but

1949
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:11,562
it's a hidden state what is actually

1950
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,302
happening in the mind and brain. But

1951
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,427
those are the kinds of experiments that

1952
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:16,247
people use. And there's some rhythms

1953
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:18,927
like the fast cycles, like gamma that

1954
01:30:18,945 --> 01:30:21,162
are playing out at the speed of

1955
01:30:21,225 --> 01:30:24,972
perception and awareness of words.

1956
01:30:25,155 --> 01:30:27,872
And then there's also slower symbolic

1957
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:30,897
or. Semantic changes in all these

1958
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:33,175
different timescales and it's just like

1959
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,647
making the space to least the

1960
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,227
connections and the terms and the

1961
01:30:40,245 --> 01:30:43,857
implication resonate and connect

1962
01:30:43,935 --> 01:30:47,397
with the learner and the creator is like

1963
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:50,575
a lot more valuable than any amount of

1964
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:55,227
coefficient of low reading. And so

1965
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,825
how to balance the information amount

1966
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:03,492
and type and sequence and all of these

1967
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:07,407
things with holding the space for

1968
01:31:07,485 --> 01:31:10,675
just a slower transformative process.

1969
01:31:12,087 --> 01:31:15,342
And that's very true. Yeah, that's huge,

1970
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:16,872
Daniel, because I think a lot of people

1971
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:19,757
that get into the instructionalism,

1972
01:31:19,847 --> 01:31:21,852
you'll hear the expression and I'm not

1973
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,697
overgeneralizing here, you'll hear,

1974
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,750
Jelle, we're going to break this down,

1975
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:29,852
as opposed to the interactionism,

1976
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:32,650
which is, we're going to slow this down.

1977
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:36,072
There's quite a difference between those

1978
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:39,207
two things. Open up and slow down, or

1979
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,402
we're going to drill down, finish it

1980
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,927
out, get it done in the time. And as we

1981
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:49,257
discuss, like, this is the archetypes or

1982
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,547
the dialectic. It's not like we're only

1983
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,727
taking one approach or another. But it's

1984
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:56,202
very easy to see how the range in at

1985
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,242
least education space, not even thinking

1986
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:01,392
of other areas, is like, it's the amount

1987
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,207
of content and then it projects down

1988
01:32:03,285 --> 01:32:06,687
into how it's delivered and then content

1989
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,502
gets slotted in or out, or things get

1990
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,947
expanded or not. Or the Monday's class

1991
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,937
gets canceled and it moves to Tuesday.

1992
01:32:13,287 --> 01:32:15,827
So that's like the sort of instruction

1993
01:32:15,932 --> 01:32:19,347
projection approach which is so

1994
01:32:19,455 --> 01:32:21,775
exafferent in multiple ways,

1995
01:32:22,137 --> 01:32:24,222
especially in how it's applied to

1996
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,932
thinking more about the opening up a

1997
01:32:25,935 --> 01:32:28,502
space and slowing down and the learner's

1998
01:32:28,532 --> 01:32:31,827
journey and all that. And when

1999
01:32:31,845 --> 01:32:34,062
you're in the huddle and you're calling

2000
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,657
out the shorthand before you actually

2001
01:32:36,735 --> 01:32:39,572
line up at the scrimmage line and snap

2002
01:32:39,617 --> 01:32:41,982
the football, it's interesting. That

2003
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,552
what you point out, Lou. In my history,

2004
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:48,297
I was always prepared to slow down when

2005
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:51,027
it was math and the symbology. Like, I

2006
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:53,247
have no problem slowing down for that.

2007
01:32:53,355 --> 01:32:55,577
But trying to read out long sentences,

2008
01:32:55,757 --> 01:32:58,525
it just about kills me. I mean, my Add,

2009
01:32:58,887 --> 01:33:02,637
I have to interleave like every 20 to 30

2010
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:05,297
minutes because if I don't, my skin

2011
01:33:05,342 --> 01:33:07,992
starts to crawl. Those sort of

2012
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,712
contextual factors that are literally

2013
01:33:10,787 --> 01:33:13,167
weighing on you, you don't know those

2014
01:33:13,215 --> 01:33:15,437
sorts of things. And if you're an expert

2015
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:17,772
who's just trying to push out all this

2016
01:33:17,805 --> 01:33:20,772
information in a 13 week window, I'm not

2017
01:33:20,805 --> 01:33:22,452
really sure whether or not you can sort

2018
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:24,192
of get down to that level of

2019
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:27,957
personalization. But if you're able to,

2020
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:29,742
it makes all the difference in the world

2021
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:31,900
in terms of what people take away from

2022
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:35,892
the exposure. Right. I find it way

2023
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,952
easier to do the shorthand thing. If a

2024
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,600
picture is worth 1000 words,

2025
01:33:42,237 --> 01:33:45,027
I'm in full agreement with that. I just

2026
01:33:45,045 --> 01:33:46,825
can't do the thousand word thing.

2027
01:33:51,012 --> 01:33:53,492
Yeah, really interesting. And Steven

2028
01:33:53,552 --> 01:33:55,167
wrote in the Chat, good to see these

2029
01:33:55,215 --> 01:33:57,497
questions about active modeling

2030
01:33:57,617 --> 01:34:00,717
expertise being thought of in different

2031
01:34:00,765 --> 01:34:02,877
ways, like the direction of travel, the

2032
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:04,587
distance to travel, the rate of travel,

2033
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:06,037
mode of transport.

2034
01:34:08,412 --> 01:34:10,762
Yeah, thanks for sharing it, Steven.

2035
01:34:11,487 --> 01:34:14,772
Landscapes and sort of the sense making

2036
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,597
and the way finding and being on this

2037
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:21,867
cognitive landscape versus or and being

2038
01:34:21,915 --> 01:34:24,297
on this spatial foraging landscape. So

2039
01:34:24,405 --> 01:34:27,297
going out for the mushroom forage with

2040
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,757
someone who's familiar with mushrooms

2041
01:34:28,772 --> 01:34:30,567
and somebody else who's familiar with

2042
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:32,457
the biochemistry but hasn't seen the

2043
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:35,592
mushroom in the ground. And then someone

2044
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,487
else who's on a different perspective

2045
01:34:37,562 --> 01:34:39,522
because of their background or people

2046
01:34:39,555 --> 01:34:41,097
with different physical abilities and

2047
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:43,872
knowledge in the spatial setting. And

2048
01:34:43,905 --> 01:34:46,832
then there's the cognitive foraging.

2049
01:34:46,997 --> 01:34:49,377
And then just like, is it that the

2050
01:34:49,395 --> 01:34:52,452
colony forages as a unit, and then

2051
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:54,197
that's the sort of flip side of the nest

2052
01:34:54,242 --> 01:34:56,997
mate's forage collectively. And so the

2053
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:00,187
team forges as a unit collectively.

2054
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,102
And the individual is sort of engaged at

2055
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:06,507
this level that we have experience at

2056
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,117
in the policy selection relevant to our

2057
01:35:09,165 --> 01:35:12,507
participation in some either

2058
01:35:12,585 --> 01:35:14,425
niche or team or project.

2059
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:20,402
Let's go back to paper, see if there's

2060
01:35:20,432 --> 01:35:23,050
any other pieces that we could kind of

2061
01:35:23,937 --> 01:35:27,187
look at. Let's look at the roadmap.

2062
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,662
Can we talk a bit about the endowment

2063
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:39,992
part of this? We haven't really touched

2064
01:35:40,052 --> 01:35:41,867
on that. Well, just the endowment.

2065
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:44,712
What's the endowment? So in the .2s,

2066
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:48,475
essentially, now that we've built this

2067
01:35:48,987 --> 01:35:52,632
base, a stable platform, what can we

2068
01:35:52,635 --> 01:35:54,927
do with it? Like, what leverage have we

2069
01:35:54,945 --> 01:35:58,002
now potentially active? So what's the

2070
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,747
endowment here in terms of what the

2071
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,962
paper really? What's the new affordances

2072
01:36:04,112 --> 01:36:06,327
that we didn't have before that we

2073
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:09,587
didn't maybe necessarily have explicated

2074
01:36:09,662 --> 01:36:11,427
quite so clearly prior to reading the

2075
01:36:11,445 --> 01:36:14,172
paper? Maybe that's one. I don't want to

2076
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,752
put pressure on Bleu, but what do you

2077
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,737
think? Bleu? So I'm trying to remember.

2078
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,567
Maybe you guys can remind me in this

2079
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:25,107
figure. Oh, wait, so endowing with

2080
01:36:25,185 --> 01:36:28,077
temporal depth. It's got to be an

2081
01:36:28,095 --> 01:36:30,025
autostap, right? Is that correct?

2082
01:36:31,287 --> 01:36:34,452
Yeah, because endowing a homeostat with

2083
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:38,275
temporal data isn't possible, right? Or

2084
01:36:39,462 --> 01:36:43,257
they can only do and I

2085
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,227
wonder if that's like, a singlecelled

2086
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:47,367
organism can only do at that moment.

2087
01:36:47,415 --> 01:36:48,972
Like they're not planning for it to get

2088
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:51,250
cold later or something like that.

2089
01:36:55,362 --> 01:36:58,922
I wonder if it's not only temporal

2090
01:36:58,967 --> 01:37:02,427
depth but any kind of relationship. I

2091
01:37:02,445 --> 01:37:05,072
wonder if it's not necessarily temporal

2092
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:08,667
depth. It's time. It's flat. Right?

2093
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:10,722
I mean, I guess in order to modify your

2094
01:37:10,755 --> 01:37:12,132
own behavior or thought, you would have

2095
01:37:12,135 --> 01:37:14,667
to have some temporal depth. But this

2096
01:37:14,715 --> 01:37:18,702
allostasis idea is interesting

2097
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:22,917
with respect to my relationship to

2098
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,542
my future self or my relationship to my

2099
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,672
previous self or my relationship to

2100
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,757
other people in my community or

2101
01:37:29,835 --> 01:37:33,700
whatever. So I just wonder

2102
01:37:34,737 --> 01:37:38,202
about if that's why this

2103
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,682
is the allocate and not the homeostat.

2104
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,752
Or like, can you endow the homeostatic

2105
01:37:42,782 --> 01:37:45,025
temporal depth and get that same kind of

2106
01:37:46,737 --> 01:37:48,282
ability for perspective and

2107
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:50,277
retrospective inference? You can't, but

2108
01:37:50,295 --> 01:37:52,752
why not? Maybe let's put some words to

2109
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,807
that. Let me see if I can find some of

2110
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,025
the paper. Nice point.

2111
01:37:57,987 --> 01:38:01,617
I would say homeostatic function could

2112
01:38:01,665 --> 01:38:03,852
be in a model with memory or

2113
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,672
anticipation. Like, the thermometer

2114
01:38:05,717 --> 01:38:08,742
could record the last 100 time points,

2115
01:38:08,865 --> 01:38:10,752
or it could have a prediction for the

2116
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:13,902
next 100. But the function would be that

2117
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,582
it only turns on the heating once it

2118
01:38:15,585 --> 01:38:18,927
gets too cold. So it still is the on

2119
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:21,822
the action selection side. It still is

2120
01:38:21,855 --> 01:38:25,347
making one Markov chain decision based

2121
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,737
upon an instantaneous measurement.

2122
01:38:30,087 --> 01:38:33,192
And so it can be implemented whether

2123
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,582
just for a computational parsimony or in

2124
01:38:36,585 --> 01:38:39,282
a simple biological system with just one

2125
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,922
time step. If it's this hot, then turn

2126
01:38:41,955 --> 01:38:45,042
on the cooling. It's the ultimate if

2127
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,097
then because it's like a threshold model

2128
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,527
and so it gets pared down over

2129
01:38:49,545 --> 01:38:51,392
evolutionary time. But then you're

2130
01:38:51,452 --> 01:38:54,237
bringing up like to even engage with a

2131
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,102
counterfactuals or some influence or

2132
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,607
something on future policy, there has to

2133
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,952
be like a depth. And then

2134
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,577
this gets back to whether it's modeling

2135
01:39:04,607 --> 01:39:08,125
the thing itself. Like what

2136
01:39:08,637 --> 01:39:11,022
do these represent? Are they the

2137
01:39:11,055 --> 01:39:13,947
scientists testing a model of one, two,

2138
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:16,067
three or four five hour temporal depth

2139
01:39:16,127 --> 01:39:19,872
for the ant forager? Or is this the

2140
01:39:19,905 --> 01:39:22,002
forager's quote, cognition model, as if

2141
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,447
that were somehow not modelbased

2142
01:39:23,492 --> 01:39:26,822
science? Or is it the neural

2143
01:39:26,867 --> 01:39:29,287
architecture or the functional anatomy

2144
01:39:30,312 --> 01:39:33,882
of the forager? There's a

2145
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:36,862
lot of ways it could lean or be framed,

2146
01:39:38,862 --> 01:39:42,102
I think, in a complementary way.

2147
01:39:42,195 --> 01:39:44,372
But one will have to be really careful

2148
01:39:44,492 --> 01:39:47,852
where support for one domain super valid

2149
01:39:47,957 --> 01:39:51,207
and where is one not? Like if it

2150
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:53,132
were a circuit board with that topology,

2151
01:39:53,222 --> 01:39:55,647
then it seems like pretty good to go to

2152
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,507
use that as a pretty broad descriptor

2153
01:39:59,522 --> 01:40:02,007
of the system. Whereas if this was a

2154
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:05,202
simplification of memory and there was

2155
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,387
an uncertainty parameter labeled

2156
01:40:07,962 --> 01:40:10,527
uncertainty or anxiety, like we

2157
01:40:10,545 --> 01:40:12,297
discussed a little earlier, someone

2158
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:14,587
slaps a parameter on one of these edges

2159
01:40:15,237 --> 01:40:18,612
and starts addressing complex real world

2160
01:40:18,675 --> 01:40:22,450
settings. How does that exactly work?

2161
01:40:27,037 --> 01:40:28,912
So one of the things that I think that

2162
01:40:28,975 --> 01:40:32,952
it endows us with is that the homeostat

2163
01:40:32,982 --> 01:40:36,662
is the basic pattern.

2164
01:40:38,287 --> 01:40:40,452
There's a partition between the epsilon

2165
01:40:40,482 --> 01:40:42,577
and the mu. So the first thing that they

2166
01:40:42,595 --> 01:40:45,267
did is they created a sort of horizontal

2167
01:40:45,327 --> 01:40:47,767
partition and then when they went to the

2168
01:40:47,815 --> 01:40:50,787
parallelism, now there's two epsilons

2169
01:40:50,937 --> 01:40:53,947
and two muse. And so now they added the

2170
01:40:54,055 --> 01:40:57,322
vertical partition as well. And I think

2171
01:40:57,355 --> 01:40:58,942
that's really, really helpful in terms

2172
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:02,397
of at the basic level of the statistical

2173
01:41:02,517 --> 01:41:04,102
we talked last time that you leave to

2174
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,802
kind of be a polymath. But I think from

2175
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,097
a modeling perspective it's getting that

2176
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:12,817
orthagonal mesh established that

2177
01:41:12,865 --> 01:41:15,737
moves us up the chain of complexity

2178
01:41:16,162 --> 01:41:17,752
because then all of a sudden you can

2179
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:21,577
have diagonal dependencies and

2180
01:41:21,595 --> 01:41:26,067
then you can actually add the z plane

2181
01:41:26,202 --> 01:41:28,072
going through this in terms of how the

2182
01:41:28,105 --> 01:41:31,147
scale is built out on both distance and

2183
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,977
time. So I think that's one of the

2184
01:41:32,995 --> 01:41:34,637
endowments that it provides.

2185
01:41:37,012 --> 01:41:39,502
I could just restate that it's like when

2186
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,472
we say that one of the advantages

2187
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,827
potentially in application of active

2188
01:41:43,857 --> 01:41:45,742
inference could be that models are

2189
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:49,692
composable, so they can be composed

2190
01:41:49,827 --> 01:41:53,377
within a given scale, like spatially or

2191
01:41:53,395 --> 01:41:56,127
temporally, and that has a visual

2192
01:41:56,307 --> 01:41:59,187
representation. It can also be composed

2193
01:41:59,262 --> 01:42:01,002
in this nested way, which as we've

2194
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,342
explore several times can represent

2195
01:42:03,402 --> 01:42:05,427
physical enclosure or temporal

2196
01:42:05,457 --> 01:42:07,287
enclosure, as well as this cognitive

2197
01:42:07,362 --> 01:42:09,897
architecture, like mental action,

2198
01:42:10,092 --> 01:42:12,052
depending on how different variables are

2199
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,872
interpreted in nested modeling. And so

2200
01:42:14,905 --> 01:42:17,977
it's composable in several dimension of

2201
01:42:17,995 --> 01:42:20,302
transformation which they represented in

2202
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,702
Figure Four in a way where each

2203
01:42:22,795 --> 01:42:25,102
transformative step, even though the

2204
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,752
function might change a lot from the

2205
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:29,225
beginning to the end. Each

2206
01:42:29,662 --> 01:42:31,392
organizational or structural

2207
01:42:31,452 --> 01:42:33,892
architectures, cognitive, step or

2208
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,082
morphological, if one is looking at that

2209
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,250
layer, can be mapped into

2210
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:43,672
a certain space and direction of

2211
01:42:43,705 --> 01:42:46,972
movement within that space. Do you think

2212
01:42:47,005 --> 01:42:48,697
it can also be sculpted out? I mean,

2213
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:49,672
because we're looking at this

2214
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:51,802
historically, we're looking at all the

2215
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,302
things that happened in the history.

2216
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:55,072
Was this the stuff that was kind of

2217
01:42:55,105 --> 01:42:58,402
carved out? And a lot of the stuff that

2218
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,027
doesn't matter removed in order for it

2219
01:43:01,045 --> 01:43:03,652
to be more comprehensible, because I

2220
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,077
agree with you, it can be composed. But

2221
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:07,177
I also think it's not decomposed. But I

2222
01:43:07,195 --> 01:43:09,382
do think or even deconstructed, I think

2223
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:11,772
it can be sculpted out of a greater

2224
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:13,325
history. A greater whole.

2225
01:43:17,437 --> 01:43:19,550
Yes, please. Sorry.

2226
01:43:22,012 --> 01:43:23,900
When you talk about a greater history,

2227
01:43:24,412 --> 01:43:27,847
when you talk about historicity in

2228
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,900
today, like during the last few hours,

2229
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,097
and we've also talked about memory, and

2230
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,047
there's a difference, right? So

2231
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,677
historicity is like, historically

2232
01:43:37,782 --> 01:43:41,962
accurate and memory is like what

2233
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:46,175
I remember or what any individual

2234
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:49,822
remembers. Yeah, we've talked about that

2235
01:43:49,855 --> 01:43:51,142
before, actually, I have, a few

2236
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:53,737
livestreams ago. All I'm thinking is

2237
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,852
that what this does is compare all the

2238
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:58,522
things that is an Axle constant that

2239
01:43:58,555 --> 01:44:01,957
said, how did he frame it so that we

2240
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:04,812
can understand why we're here now versus

2241
01:44:04,962 --> 01:44:06,907
all the things that didn't make it

2242
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,177
right. That's essentially what I'm

2243
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:11,877
talking about in terms of explaining.

2244
01:44:12,057 --> 01:44:14,227
Right. They're explaining why something

2245
01:44:14,395 --> 01:44:16,317
got to the place that it did, as opposed

2246
01:44:16,377 --> 01:44:19,402
to the necessity of all the things you

2247
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,577
had to do, all the things you had to

2248
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:25,402
compose in order to realize I'm trying

2249
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,777
to bring that back to a sculpting

2250
01:44:27,807 --> 01:44:31,182
metaphor now. Awesome. So that's

2251
01:44:31,347 --> 01:44:34,027
the actual constant 2021 paper. The

2252
01:44:34,045 --> 01:44:36,207
title was the Free Energy Principle.

2253
01:44:36,372 --> 01:44:38,572
It's not about what it takes. It's about

2254
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:41,707
what took you there. That's definitely

2255
01:44:41,785 --> 01:44:44,007
an evolution perspective. And it's

2256
01:44:44,172 --> 01:44:46,317
partially because of Axel's background

2257
01:44:46,377 --> 01:44:49,527
in evolution and ecology, because that's

2258
01:44:49,557 --> 01:44:51,877
what we can say about evolution. This is

2259
01:44:51,895 --> 01:44:55,267
what got birds here. Right? And so

2260
01:44:55,315 --> 01:44:57,907
the counterfactuals in evolution are a

2261
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,602
really interesting topic and that's sort

2262
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,900
of explored in a variety of

2263
01:45:03,937 --> 01:45:05,767
more popular as well as more

2264
01:45:05,815 --> 01:45:08,002
mathematical treatments, like how do we

2265
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:10,897
go from the observed, which must have

2266
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:13,252
existed? So it's very easy to fall to

2267
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:14,812
them being the best of all possible

2268
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:17,677
worlds, optimal form, etc. But then we

2269
01:45:17,695 --> 01:45:19,422
also recognize the changing environments

2270
01:45:19,467 --> 01:45:21,337
and interactions and all that. And then

2271
01:45:21,475 --> 01:45:24,927
Bleu, like with the historicity facts

2272
01:45:25,032 --> 01:45:26,952
and the impacts, which are like facts

2273
01:45:26,982 --> 01:45:30,022
that aren't known. And then there's the

2274
01:45:30,055 --> 01:45:32,312
memory, which requires a perspective.

2275
01:45:33,562 --> 01:45:35,152
People could use system memory or

2276
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:37,072
something to refer to a factor and

2277
01:45:37,105 --> 01:45:39,742
impact on a system. But these are just

2278
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:43,267
being used loosely like some parts of

2279
01:45:43,315 --> 01:45:45,607
how the past influence the present and

2280
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:47,827
the future have to do with systems that

2281
01:45:47,845 --> 01:45:51,350
take a perspective. Other impacts are

2282
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:54,402
not through those adaptive active

2283
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:57,067
inference agents. And so that's very

2284
01:45:57,115 --> 01:46:00,082
different. And so historicity is kind of

2285
01:46:00,085 --> 01:46:03,397
like the stigma g pheromone layer and

2286
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:05,227
then there's like memory with the

2287
01:46:05,245 --> 01:46:07,177
forager. So you could talk about the

2288
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:08,982
memory of the ground for the pheromone,

2289
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,927
but it makes sense to just remember that

2290
01:46:10,945 --> 01:46:12,382
it's a different thing with the

2291
01:46:12,385 --> 01:46:14,377
pheromone on the ground than the

2292
01:46:14,395 --> 01:46:18,922
cognitive infra ant. And no

2293
01:46:18,955 --> 01:46:20,750
nest may is going to have all the

2294
01:46:21,262 --> 01:46:23,797
knowledge or the onboard modeling to

2295
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:29,422
make decisions safer. The ones that dot

2296
01:46:29,455 --> 01:46:30,807
two complicate it too much, but it's

2297
01:46:30,822 --> 01:46:32,422
stuck in the dialectic between doing

2298
01:46:32,455 --> 01:46:34,702
exactly what worked in the least, which

2299
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,877
is to say recently succeeded, but might

2300
01:46:36,895 --> 01:46:39,072
not work in the future and changing

2301
01:46:39,117 --> 01:46:40,647
things. But once you move into changing

2302
01:46:40,692 --> 01:46:43,177
things, the space of the adjacency of

2303
01:46:43,195 --> 01:46:45,907
changing is sometimes like daunting and

2304
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:47,077
you still haven't really address the

2305
01:46:47,095 --> 01:46:51,187
problem of changing world. So origin

2306
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:54,547
is a very deep entry point into a lot of

2307
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,697
these questions in active inference and

2308
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:59,767
in other areas because it really

2309
01:46:59,815 --> 01:47:02,612
connects to the egocentric,

2310
01:47:03,637 --> 01:47:06,472
hopefully not in the Solop cystic or

2311
01:47:06,505 --> 01:47:09,052
narcissistic sense, but just in the

2312
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:13,037
wayfinding sense making paradigm

2313
01:47:13,987 --> 01:47:17,525
that actually accommodates for others

2314
01:47:18,112 --> 01:47:19,852
through modeling them explicitly and

2315
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,847
prioritizing the environment and things

2316
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:26,512
like that. So pretty cool.

2317
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:29,502
And this paper just to kind of restate

2318
01:47:29,607 --> 01:47:32,162
what they brought to the picture,

2319
01:47:32,887 --> 01:47:35,277
they looked at evolutionary time scales

2320
01:47:35,307 --> 01:47:38,067
and they framed cognition as structural

2321
01:47:38,127 --> 01:47:40,527
change, which in a Bayesian modeling

2322
01:47:40,557 --> 01:47:42,567
framework is sometimes called structural

2323
01:47:42,627 --> 01:47:44,967
learning as opposed to like parameter

2324
01:47:45,027 --> 01:47:46,792
learning, fine tuning given the model

2325
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,167
structure. And they connected that

2326
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:53,902
to the Bayesian graph model of active

2327
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,572
inference lab partitioning and then

2328
01:47:56,605 --> 01:47:59,347
connected that to the factor graphs and

2329
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:01,700
then using the homeostat example,

2330
01:48:02,062 --> 01:48:03,577
talked about how there could be like

2331
01:48:03,595 --> 01:48:07,287
elaborations into other structures.

2332
01:48:07,362 --> 01:48:09,802
So from structures to each other that

2333
01:48:09,895 --> 01:48:12,402
might be enabling the rise of phenotypes

2334
01:48:12,432 --> 01:48:15,552
or enabling the modeling of phenotypes

2335
01:48:15,732 --> 01:48:17,000
that are interesting.

2336
01:48:20,437 --> 01:48:23,872
Okay, any final thoughts are like,

2337
01:48:23,905 --> 01:48:27,202
where does this tape take us? What is

2338
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,077
exafferent now? What are we going to be

2339
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:30,575
talking about soon?

2340
01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:36,502
So I'm excited to really delve into the

2341
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:40,625
math that is going to get behind

2342
01:48:40,987 --> 01:48:43,417
the models that were elucidated out in

2343
01:48:43,465 --> 01:48:47,392
figure four. How do we go through

2344
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,525
time and through relationality and

2345
01:48:52,462 --> 01:48:55,712
hierarchical dimensions and so forth?

2346
01:48:59,137 --> 01:49:01,677
Okay. Thank you. Bleu Dean. You won't

2347
01:49:01,707 --> 01:49:02,827
have the least word, but what do you

2348
01:49:02,845 --> 01:49:03,425
think?

2349
01:49:06,037 --> 01:49:08,407
Jelle I'm still trying to figure out how

2350
01:49:08,485 --> 01:49:10,147
this sort of ties in with the whole

2351
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:13,327
identity piece. I left that because I

2352
01:49:13,345 --> 01:49:14,947
thought that was just a rabbit hole that

2353
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:16,927
went way too far and too deep. But I

2354
01:49:16,945 --> 01:49:19,117
know that when you do get that

2355
01:49:19,165 --> 01:49:21,875
parallelism and when you. Can sort of

2356
01:49:23,287 --> 01:49:26,032
create a dimensional grid that has a

2357
01:49:26,035 --> 01:49:28,477
negative space as well. So like, you can

2358
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:32,272
be as units going positively or

2359
01:49:32,305 --> 01:49:34,522
negatively and passing through zero and

2360
01:49:34,555 --> 01:49:37,732
how that fits with identity. That's kind

2361
01:49:37,735 --> 01:49:39,277
of a personal thing that I got to do.

2362
01:49:39,295 --> 01:49:42,322
The other thing the thing that I really

2363
01:49:42,355 --> 01:49:44,542
liked about this paper is that I think

2364
01:49:44,665 --> 01:49:47,902
it took something that's really, as you

2365
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,127
said, over huge timescales and sort

2366
01:49:51,145 --> 01:49:55,250
of took it back down to something that

2367
01:49:56,212 --> 01:49:58,417
might be digestible for a lot of people

2368
01:49:58,465 --> 01:50:00,592
that otherwise they kind of go okay, so

2369
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,977
here's 1000 years ago or a million years

2370
01:50:02,995 --> 01:50:05,722
ago or whatever. From the bacteria to

2371
01:50:05,755 --> 01:50:09,342
now. What are the sort of basic

2372
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:12,757
building blocks that we say might have

2373
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:16,162
might have played Hae Park in getting

2374
01:50:16,225 --> 01:50:19,147
to the kind of sophistication where we

2375
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,592
are now? And again, I think it's about

2376
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,697
learning. I always think that evolution

2377
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:26,825
is about learning. And so,

2378
01:50:28,012 --> 01:50:31,372
as I said in the .1, this affirmed a lot

2379
01:50:31,405 --> 01:50:33,847
of the stuff that I think we need to be

2380
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,472
bringing into some of the more formal

2381
01:50:35,517 --> 01:50:37,850
ways that we structure learning because

2382
01:50:38,287 --> 01:50:41,277
I think it's learning sort of unleashed

2383
01:50:41,307 --> 01:50:43,475
as opposed to all tied up.

2384
01:50:45,862 --> 01:50:49,252
Awesome. Thanks both and everybody who

2385
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:52,072
was helping in all the ways for the

2386
01:50:52,105 --> 01:50:54,177
previous videos. Just some last thoughts

2387
01:50:54,207 --> 01:50:58,147
would be like from both of you and

2388
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:00,592
hopefully all together. There's really

2389
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,037
some interesting insights into learning

2390
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,022
and education for active inference

2391
01:51:05,067 --> 01:51:07,542
learning, which is kind of like our meta

2392
01:51:07,602 --> 01:51:09,852
regime of attention active inference lab

2393
01:51:09,882 --> 01:51:12,427
lab when we're in that regime of

2394
01:51:12,445 --> 01:51:15,247
attention. But many people have other

2395
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,797
regimes of attention where it would

2396
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:21,247
certainly apply to bring some

2397
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,797
of these methods and ideas in and also

2398
01:51:23,905 --> 01:51:27,892
bring pieces from outside into our

2399
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:30,997
cognitive modeling of attention and

2400
01:51:31,105 --> 01:51:33,472
collaboration and communication. Like

2401
01:51:33,655 --> 01:51:35,602
those topics and how those are the

2402
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:39,187
pillars of education and research during

2403
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:42,202
a time when education and research and

2404
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:45,652
participation are evolving is some of

2405
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:48,322
the most interesting things. And so to

2406
01:51:48,355 --> 01:51:53,112
be able to read evolutionary papers

2407
01:51:53,262 --> 01:51:56,762
that take a cool scope and approach

2408
01:51:57,187 --> 01:52:00,417
and then connect it to how we're

2409
01:52:00,477 --> 01:52:02,797
hopefully organizing together and

2410
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,452
including the affordance to participate

2411
01:52:04,482 --> 01:52:06,350
with anyone who's listening now,

2412
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:10,522
it's an interesting mixture. So I hope

2413
01:52:10,555 --> 01:52:13,117
that we all can just keep on learning

2414
01:52:13,165 --> 01:52:17,257
and applying together. All right,

2415
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:20,437
peace. Thanks, guys. Thanks again.
