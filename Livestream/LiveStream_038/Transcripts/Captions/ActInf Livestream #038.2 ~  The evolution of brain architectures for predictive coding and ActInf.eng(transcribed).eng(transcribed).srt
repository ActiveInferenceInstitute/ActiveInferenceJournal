00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,558
hello and welcome everyone to active lab

4
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,520
live stream number 38.2 it's february

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
23rd 2022.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
welcome to actin flap we are a

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,280
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
at the links here on this page

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,120
this is recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,399
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
feedback so that we can improve our work

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,719
welcome and we'll follow good video

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
etiquette for live streams

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
go to activeinference.org to learn more

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,959
about how to participate in any of these

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,439
live streams which are part of the coms

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,280
communications organizational unit or

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
just any other part of the

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,400
lab all right today in active stream

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
number 38.2 we're going to be having our

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
third discussion there's the dot zero

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
the dot one and now the dot two on this

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
paper

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
the evolution of brain architectures for

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
predictive coding and active inference

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
and

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
maybe each of us have a few ideas in

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
mind and i'm sure we'll come up with a

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
few other things plus if anyone's

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
watching live they can write a comment

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
in the chat

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
so we'll start with just

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
uh introduction saying anything if we

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
want about the paper before just

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
jumping in somewhere or

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,600
somewhere else

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,799
california and i will pass it to d

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,759
hi i'm dean i'm

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,479
up here in calgary and uh

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
i'm not

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
doing very much except trying to keep up

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,680
with all the papers that we're looking

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
at in active inference and i'll pass it

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
down to blue

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
i'm blue i'm a research consultant in

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,640
new mexico and i really enjoyed this

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
paper

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
for

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
many reasons the my background in

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
neuroscience not not

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
like

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
being a priority but yeah it is

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
so i'm excited to get into it and to

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
discuss some of the points that i picked

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,359
up with you guys

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
well

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,599
blue

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
joining us today

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
what figure

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,120
can we start with or

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
start with a blank

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
sheet and just any of the points that

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
you'd like to raise or

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
we can do something else

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,360
uh man like figure four for me was like

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,840
awesome um so maybe that was my favorite

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
figure maybe that's the one we should

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
start with

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
okay

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
all right

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
so what was your just

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
perspective on what figure four was and

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
then what did it mean or why was it

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
interesting for you

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,159
so i was interested in this figure and

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,480
maybe like even in

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
how this figure could be expanded in

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
terms of

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,319
hierarchical depth and temporal depth

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,280
um and temporal depth like has more than

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
one potential scale

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
um which isn't really

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,319
like mentioned here like temporal depths

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,040
can be thought of as like

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
small time steps like what am i going to

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
do next what's my next action

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
but also like in bigger time steps like

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
what is the next iteration of me and how

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,360
like these hierarchical depths like

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
because that's obviously like a larger

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
level hierarchy like the next iteration

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
of me as a species or the human species

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
right like what is the next iteration of

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
the species versus what is the next

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
action i'm going to perform as part of

100
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
the species so that was kind of um an

101
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
interesting like

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
perspectival

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
dance that they took

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
and just really like the the

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
yeah multi-dimensionality of this

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
um and how to kind of think about it in

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
like a

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
maybe like a

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
is this like a a multi-dimensional space

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
right like is it like um in terms of

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
like my cells what are myself going to

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
do next my tissues my organs me my

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
active inference lab like like what

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,280
what are all these things going to do

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
next and also like

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
on that level is that like a short time

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
frame or is it like a large time frame

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
and do the time frames differ or can

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
like the same hierarchical level have

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,759
more than one time frame

121
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,400
or or not

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
okay

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,520
nice questions

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
dean what do you

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
think about any of that

126
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
as we start to

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
look at figure four as a starting point

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
for talking more about what blue just

129
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,000
mentioned

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
well i think

131
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,639
one of the one of the things we touched

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
on in the point one was

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,600
the idea that within a frame there's

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
also an orthogonal

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
mesh so as we push

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,240
through this representation

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
from

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
the bottom up are we going from what

139
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
might be described as an architectural

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
existence

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
to at the top what we might describe as

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
architectural

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
learning now of course

144
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
if we take that position we have to be

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
careful that we're not reinforcing

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
the idea that it's all about

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
constructivism all the time

148
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
versus being creative

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
right like i think you need to be a

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,199
little bit of both and i'm not being

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,919
creationist like not one story that

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
carries forward all the way through time

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,199
as blue

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,440
kind of ref left there

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
but the idea that the updating

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
matters throughout the time

157
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
scale that you choose to look at

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
and so now the question is is

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
architecture

160
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
the lens that we should be using to talk

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,560
about how we advance from mere existence

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
to a place that we would describe as

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
learning

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
i mean that's what it was chosen here

165
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
but is that the is that though is that

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,440
the one way now right it's a way it's a

167
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
good way

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
it certainly makes something super super

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,160
complex into something that's just

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,600
complicated

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,199
but is it the only way i don't know

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,919
just um

173
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
one

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
question of clarification when you said

175
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
this is the only way what were you

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,199
referring to this figure four or what

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
through through architecture the idea of

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
an architecture

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
right the architectural lens

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
as opposed to other ways that we might

181
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,560
build out this idea of going from

182
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,520
homeostatic existence to going from

183
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
unknowing

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
to knowing

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
and whatever that means

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,039
okay

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,280
um thanks for sharing it just to kind of

188
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
maybe connect this you mentioned

189
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
architectural distance

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
which is within

191
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
the metered space

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
whatever the metric is or the measure or

193
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,479
the grids that you draw

194
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,360
there's

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,319
a distance within a map

196
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
and that's like the ecological transect

197
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
that's the blueprint um that's the

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
forensic analysis and then that's like

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
parametric learning because it's a

200
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
distortion of parameters in a given

201
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
space

202
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,479
and then

203
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,919
fully defined

204
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
not just like space for openness whereas

205
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,639
the architectural learning

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,479
is at the structural level architectural

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
and then that was kind of like what you

208
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,879
related to not just the homeostatic

209
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
or even the allostatic perhaps

210
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,160
but something that's like the sort of

211
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,840
unknown unknown

212
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,400
open-endedness

213
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
biological open

214
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
evolutionary trajectories yeah so not

215
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
just sustaining it but actually

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,000
realizing it so

217
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
so we'll just get a few notes like on

218
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
each of these transformations then see

219
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
what other ones or like what are some

220
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
situations that might model then also

221
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,680
return to the questions that were

222
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
raised early by blue like with a

223
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,760
multi-level self

224
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
and like where the where's mental action

225
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
or

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
thought in this

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,399
model

228
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
the examples were provided of like for

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
example with the allostat

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
that

231
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
took the temperature homeostat and then

232
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
added in in their example like the

233
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,399
sunrise visual detector and modeler

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,279
column

235
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
and so that gave the anticipatory change

236
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
in body temperature when the sun was

237
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
viewed

238
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,240
but then

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
is there a

240
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
similar structure

241
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
for cognition is it just like linking

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
together senses

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
in more and more combinatoric way

244
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,600
it's a very sense

245
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
oriented perspective which from an

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
evolutionary perspective

247
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
which is what this paper is exploring

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
that's the one to ground further

249
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
elaborations and changes on

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
rather than trying to reverse

251
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
from something like engaging encounter

252
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
factuals

253
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
so just using an active inference model

254
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
sometimes for a counter factual agent if

255
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,839
the model says that

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
that's okay or doing the bacteria

257
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
without implying that it's doing the

258
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
counter factual explicitly that might be

259
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,000
possible too

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
so we have thermal regulation in the

261
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
paper but then the question is is does

262
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,800
that equate to feelings in a human being

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
right

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
like it does all that that feelings

265
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,399
cover necessarily collapse down to the

266
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
example of thermal regulation

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
and at what point

268
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
are we aware of the fact that there

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
might be a difference between the

270
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
example

271
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
and the concept

272
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,839
like where in this figure four

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,079
is that is that blurry line that we

274
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,200
cross

275
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
it's a good it's a good question i don't

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,519
know

277
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
where it is

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
so dean are you talking about feelings

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
like emotions or feelings like

280
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
sensations or both oh yeah all of that

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
right like so feelings tends to take on

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
a big sort of

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
it's it's it's more detached from the

284
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
example of thermal regulation

285
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
and yet that's just the fact that you

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
can ask that question proves out that

287
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
maybe the one example doesn't cover all

288
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
of the different aspects

289
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
of the higher concept right

290
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
and that's where the scaling part comes

291
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
in so it's not just

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,760
it's not just temporal depth that allows

293
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,959
for that you have to have the temporal

294
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,959
depth and the hierarchical depth

295
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
what kind of feelings are you talking

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
about

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
implies that that there's

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
there's more than one

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
way that has to exist for you to come at

300
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,519
that

301
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,680
to ask that question how do we where do

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,560
we draw the partition

303
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
right

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
so in here

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
they

306
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
show duplication

307
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,639
but it kind of i'm not going to say it

308
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
misleads but it could potentially

309
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
mislead if you think that there's a

310
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
linearity to this

311
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
when in fact

312
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
a couple of times daniel talked in the

313
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
point one about the fact that there is a

314
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
step function moment there is a jump

315
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
it's not a jump i forget an example of

316
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,600
you

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
thought about one example where we can't

318
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
say

319
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
you just go from one eye

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
to two just because i think that was one

321
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
of the examples you gave daniel but at

322
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
some over evolutionary time there is

323
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
these little progressions where if you

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
look back on it it seems like a rather

325
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
large jump took place

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
right

327
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
let me give a few

328
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
points there so the when you said like

329
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
the big jumps and so

330
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
uh in one

331
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
sense that's related to the kind of

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,079
discussion around complex patterns of

333
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
evolution and some phenotypes or

334
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,839
genotype regions that are very stable

335
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
through long periods of time over many

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,360
generations like the ultra conserved

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
elements in the genome that have very

338
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
low mutation rates versus regions that

339
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
have high mutation rates etc

340
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
and then same as phenotypes like

341
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
phenotypes that are very constant like

342
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,480
the coelacanth fish or phenotypes that

343
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
are very

344
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
plastic or dynamic or ones that we just

345
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
don't have the records

346
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
of

347
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
um

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
and then how to connect what is

349
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
happening or the models that we want to

350
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
make in

351
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,399
humans

352
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
especially with computer enabled and

353
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
language-enabled humans

354
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
technology-enabled humans with the

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
continuum of

356
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,560
cognitive processes

357
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
and then

358
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
you said like it's not linear

359
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
and then

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
that kind of

361
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
made me think like there's like feelings

362
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,920
which

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
um was still it's still a rich

364
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
qualitative area

365
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
like you brought out like sensations but

366
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
also experiences and emotions

367
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
and then

368
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,110
how

369
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,279
[Music]

370
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,320
quickly slash securely or um

371
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
unambiguously can we map just that cloud

372
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
of concepts just to be like it's a

373
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
policy selection on attention it's an

374
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
uncertainty on

375
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
valence

376
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
it's valence like we're doing the

377
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,720
parametric cognitive model

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
with this

379
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
but it's still even a little bit open

380
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,199
what this represents is this the

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,600
evolutionary biologists

382
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,079
doing model testing on a phylogenetic

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,360
tree

384
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,160
or

385
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,399
is this talking about the genomic or the

386
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,839
neurophysiological components that have

387
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,800
to be connected just anatomically

388
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,360
for a certain function to arise

389
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
and

390
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
that is the rich area that there's so

391
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
much to explore in to

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
well i think the one thing we can agree

393
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
on is it it because we're talking about

394
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
evolution we're talking about history so

395
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
it is backwards looking and backwards

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
looking is

397
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
easier than

398
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
looking into the future right

399
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
so i think that's one thing we can agree

400
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
on so what this is trying to do is

401
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
explain

402
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
perhaps how the history came about

403
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
so one thing um that the authors

404
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
mentioned as well and that's kind of

405
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,720
linked to the idea of feelings um you

406
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
know this was a discussion about the

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
evolution of brain architecture but

408
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
there's also the fact that

409
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
brains are in bodies they don't just

410
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
exist in jars

411
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
and and for me at least um i feel like

412
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
i feel

413
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,360
like emotions not necessarily sensations

414
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,519
but i feel like emotions are driven in a

415
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,880
large part by the body like we've we've

416
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,040
made a huge kind of connection between

417
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
like the gut and the brain

418
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,920
um

419
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
and like there's probably more

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
connections to be

421
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,839
felt

422
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,480
um because i feel feelings like emotions

423
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
deeply in my body like i feel them in my

424
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
heart or i feel them in my stomach or i

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,959
feel them in my pinky toe so

426
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
i i really think that the idea of like

427
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
emotions are is

428
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
can't be separated from from embodiment

429
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,120
um but prediction i think

430
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
it's a mental activity or at least like

431
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,839
i feel it in my

432
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,360
brain so i don't know if that's the same

433
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
kind of um

434
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,079
sensation that everyone has but like

435
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,680
prediction is

436
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
in my mind a brain thing but i know that

437
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
it's also that's overrideable like if

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,079
someone throws a ball at me like i put

439
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
my hand up like that's a reflex

440
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,120
so

441
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
but that's is that like my brain driving

442
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,399
my body

443
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,000
i'm not sure really but i know that

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
there's um you know

445
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
some prediction that's maybe not

446
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
mental that's more like physical or

447
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
that's more embodied is probably the

448
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
right word

449
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
and you kind of move into that intuitive

450
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
space as well right like if you think

451
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
about going to the beach i can't tell

452
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,000
whether you're going to think about the

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
wetness aspect of that the the warmness

454
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
part of that the the smell of the

455
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,760
sunscreen part of that

456
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,919
but you're gonna but that prediction is

457
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,039
gonna also

458
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,760
generate embodied

459
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,959
emotions

460
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,720
even though you may not articulate them

461
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,599
right

462
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,919
you're still intuiting them

463
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
you're still anticipating them and so

464
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,039
i'm not sure how the architecture

465
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
pulls that out especially to daniel's

466
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
point where

467
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,440
our

468
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,039
our form has adapted

469
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,160
evolutionarily to the to the

470
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
phenotypical situation that we find

471
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,760
ourselves in

472
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,799
and going forward

473
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,039
with let's say with let's say that sea

474
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
levels rise and suddenly you have

475
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
beachfront property where for millions

476
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,559
of years you did not how does that

477
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,520
affect now your emotions

478
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,480
right

479
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,440
so

480
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
i i like the architectural idea of being

481
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
able to take something and look at the

482
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
historicity of it and be able to be able

483
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
to explain it out with a little bit more

484
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
confidence

485
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,799
um i'm not sure though i'm still

486
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
struggling with being able to figure out

487
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,559
how

488
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,640
if we want to look ahead

489
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
we can necessarily set it up the layered

490
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,520
way it was set up here and i really like

491
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
figure four

492
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,679
so but i just have to categorize it and

493
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,840
keep it where it's most useful which is

494
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
in the backwards facing part of this

495
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
that's all

496
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
okay

497
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,400
let's return to how to use this right

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
that sounds like a good question but

499
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
we'll get there

500
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,440
so

501
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
um

502
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
lou brought up the

503
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
brain and compliment with the body and

504
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
this was just the quote from the very

505
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,120
final lines of the paper or near the

506
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,160
ends

507
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
um

508
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,559
where they acknowledge that

509
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,280
partial perspective that they present in

510
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
the paper partial meaning just a portion

511
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
of but also partial like

512
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
partial to a certain view because

513
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
they're

514
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
with a neuroscience regime of attention

515
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
and that's the contribution that was

516
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
made that helps apply to other systems

517
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
and then there's another synthesis to be

518
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
made

519
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
and this is kind of like the opening

520
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
where they just

521
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
acknowledge that cognition can be

522
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
extended and embodied and it suggests

523
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
that not all aspects of control need to

524
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
be solved by or represented

525
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,679
a central generative model

526
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
so it's this point that we've come to

527
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
from many different angles from like the

528
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
ecological

529
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
and the cognitive and then here from

530
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,799
more of a structure learning perspective

531
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,840
that like

532
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,080
the representation

533
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
whether just in the model of a system or

534
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,080
in the system's own self-representation

535
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
it doesn't have to be

536
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,760
the exact same thing

537
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
as some latent variable in the outside

538
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
world

539
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,159
so it's possible to have like an

540
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
effective model of climate action

541
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,880
without a perfectly accurate model

542
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
but that has to be understood within

543
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
like was brought up a space of counter

544
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,919
factuals of what could happen

545
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,039
from the outside world where we really

546
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
never can eradicate the total

547
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
distribution and also the introduction

548
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
of like unknown unknowns and so that's

549
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
the fundamental openness of the external

550
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
states

551
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,120
and the modeler's view and then there's

552
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,720
um

553
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
still a lot to explore with the

554
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,720
counterfactuals of the models

555
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
that the

556
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
system that like the agent is

557
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
can implement

558
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,120
but i think that

559
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,280
gets a little bit to how to start to use

560
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
it

561
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
in

562
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
a certain area

563
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,480
but

564
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
um

565
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
yeah any thoughts or what i've got a

566
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
question for you dan

567
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
i when you study dance for example and

568
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
they're foraging and they i think it's

569
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,240
section 8 or i forget what section that

570
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
they say foraging really really matters

571
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
i think if we're point doing this now

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
i think that the sort of the go forward

573
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
piece of this is now

574
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,360
when you started looking at ants did you

575
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,039
start from a position i don't know what

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
your background is but did you start

577
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
from a position of

578
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,840
sort of pulling apart the

579
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,480
historicity of why that thing is now

580
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
sort of laid out the way it is i know

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,919
there's a there's a

582
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
there's a piece of that that's there but

583
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
is that is that the place where most

584
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,679
people that begin a study start

585
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,280
which is kind of interesting about this

586
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
paper because it to me

587
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,860
um

588
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,600
[Music]

589
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,919
going from existence to learning

590
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,240
implies a certain history and so i'm

591
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
wondering how you sort of come at

592
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
things when you see them foraging

593
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280
where where history fits

594
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,039
in terms of that

595
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,960
you gaining some understanding of what

596
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
what's happening here

597
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,480
as opposed to then what happens

598
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
great question

599
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,799
the topic is historiosity and foraging

600
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,720
for 400 from dean

601
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,679
um

602
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
blue what would you say on the topic

603
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,919
first how would you bring that together

604
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,720
what would be some important points

605
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,159
so um

606
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,360
i really liked this um idea also and i

607
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
have like a completely unrelated point

608
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,720
and then an unrelated question so um it

609
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
says mechanisms of memory and planning

610
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
have evolved from mechanisms of

611
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,200
navigation in the physical world and

612
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
some super interesting that i thought

613
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,679
side point was if you've ever read the

614
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,280
book deep work by cal newport

615
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
he talks about memorizing a deck of

616
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
cards and if you haven't read the book

617
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
read the book but um it's interesting

618
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
because he goes through a very elaborate

619
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,520
um

620
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,600
way to memorize the deck of cards and

621
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,400
it's through building a memory palace

622
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
and so in this memory palace um you have

623
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
like a place that you know very well

624
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,240
like your own house you can imagine

625
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
walking through your door you imagine

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,480
the porch the doorstep how it looks you

627
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
imagine the um you know the doorway you

628
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
know all the rooms all the closets like

629
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,039
you imagine going through your house

630
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,280
taking a tour and exploring each room in

631
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
a very systematic way so it's very easy

632
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
to memorize a route you would take

633
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,840
through your house like say you're

634
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
looking for a ghost in your closet or

635
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
something hiding in your house how would

636
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
you look so so you go through your house

637
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
and you um so you have this palace right

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
that you have in your mind and then um

639
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,799
he talks about uh making every card a

640
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,080
character right like like so you know um

641
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
the queen of hearts is you know queen

642
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,360
elizabeth or or something like who is

643
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,000
each character in the card's deck so

644
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,880
each

645
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
character in the card deck becomes a

646
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,080
character that you memorize so you've

647
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,880
memorized these 52 cards as people that

648
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
you know

649
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
and then and so this is an interesting

650
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
play also on the sociodynamics as well

651
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,200
as the spatial dynamics so each

652
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
character in the deck is the person that

653
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,799
you know well you memorized that 52

654
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,559
people correspond to these 52 cards and

655
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
you know the layout of your house so

656
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,919
then when you can go through the order

657
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,760
of the deck anybody can do it you can

658
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
repeat back the order right away so like

659
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,200
you go through the cards and you say

660
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
okay you know you can go through it

661
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
three or four times then you know the

662
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,919
entire order of the deck of cards so

663
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
this is how to repeat back the order of

664
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
a deck of cards in

665
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,799
like just you memorize the order like oh

666
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
there's the queen of hearts she's in my

667
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
closet and you know like all these or

668
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,919
who's standing in the doorway it's like

669
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
the first card right and so you know the

670
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,039
tour through the house and you place

671
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,240
these people in this spatial orientation

672
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
in your house

673
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
and so and and this is like a proven

674
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
solid way like the people that do these

675
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
kind of memory tricks use by

676
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
constructing this memory palace and i

677
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
thought that that was super interesting

678
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,360
um in relation to this paper that memory

679
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
and planning have evolved from

680
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
mechanisms of navigation

681
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,360
in the physical world and i also wonder

682
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,400
if there is like a social role

683
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
that also contributes to memory and

684
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
could that social role be

685
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
this kind of higher level alistar right

686
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,600
like we talk about the homeostat and

687
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,080
that's like there's no other like you've

688
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
got one time step right and then in the

689
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
other set there's other ways to kind of

690
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
modify um but how many like

691
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
like in a social component you know to

692
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,039
succeed in function and to actively have

693
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,279
memory and prediction like does the

694
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,039
tissue have memory because there's other

695
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
cells in the tissue does an ant have

696
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
memory because it can spatially navigate

697
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
for food and also it knows it's friends

698
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
you know like i'm sure like ants have

699
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
ways to distinguish one ant from another

700
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
and um like they're very social

701
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,120
creatures like i don't think that

702
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,400
they're they all think that they're all

703
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
the same like my cats don't definitely

704
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,799
don't

705
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,480
like you my cats know each other but

706
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
like if you showed them like a stray cat

707
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,760
like they'd be really upset at the stray

708
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
cat i'm sure so you know animals know

709
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
each other i'm sure ants know each other

710
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,039
also and so what component of memory is

711
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,000
also social um and that just yeah how

712
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
many points would remind me of that or

713
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
brought that to light sorry sorry

714
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,720
awesome

715
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
it brings up a lot of the aspects that

716
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,799
i get attitude now just from a

717
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,720
specifically anti

718
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
perspective

719
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,960
so you mentioned the evolutionary aspect

720
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,640
it's one of the themes of the paper that

721
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,799
perhaps from foraging but

722
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
other processes too as key cognitive

723
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
demands

724
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,840
those early challenges or like

725
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,760
ancestral challenges giving rise to

726
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,200
current life were faced in and met in

727
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,760
this way so that was the evolutionary

728
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,279
aspect you mentioned

729
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
and then um

730
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
thinking about the history

731
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
at multiple nested scales so like

732
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,039
there's the history of the ant colony

733
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,159
as

734
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
a genuine modelable entity

735
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
where the colony year after year kind of

736
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,919
develops in its foraging territory

737
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,039
as its colony personality or basically

738
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,919
phenotype at the colony level um evolve

739
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,480
and then uh asterisk

740
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
one

741
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
then at the nest mate level it's the

742
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,679
recent interactions of a nest mate that

743
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
induce it to forage

744
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
locally meaning retrieving a seed so

745
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
like there might be an ant whose current

746
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
neural or hormonal state is such that a

747
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,240
lot of interactions with incoming

748
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
foragers

749
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
don't stimulate more foraging but then

750
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
there might be another ant whose status

751
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,200
is such that

752
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
um a certain reduced rate of

753
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
interactions with other foragers maybe

754
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
even no interactions with other foragers

755
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
in the entry chamber

756
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
cause it to go on a foraging trip

757
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
that foraging biology is specific to

758
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,279
this ant shown here the harvester ant

759
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,039
but maybe other ants too okay that's

760
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,679
asterisk two then there's the ant tissue

761
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,159
and like each of the ant tissues the

762
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,480
brain the different glands

763
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,960
um the gut they're all undergoing kind

764
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,159
of

765
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,520
stereotyped transitions that are called

766
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,679
temporal polyethylene or they're going

767
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,760
through like recent changes like a leg

768
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,200
was lost and then the rest of the body

769
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
like adapts so that's like the history

770
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,080
of each nest mate tissue

771
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,640
the asterisks kind of combine for me

772
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
personally but also just more

773
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,559
conceptually

774
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,120
with thinking about the relational view

775
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,960
on modeling the ants

776
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,279
like not taking too

777
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,480
strong

778
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,399
a view on where

779
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,480
phenomena should be located in terms of

780
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,039
nest mate versus collective cognitive

781
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,279
features and then also the place based

782
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,880
and the field and the long-term

783
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
experiments

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,120
so

785
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,159
my advisor professor deborah gordon

786
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,120
has done like a 30-year plus field study

787
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
in arizona

788
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
and so i was doing five years of field

789
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,799
work there

790
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,720
but it was like year

791
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
i don't know 20 something or 30

792
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,559
something to some other number five

793
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
years later in this space

794
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,919
where there was a lot known about this

795
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,559
ant with a long-lived colony but with

796
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,799
turnover of the foragers

797
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,840
and so

798
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,919
the sort of

799
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,039
ecological and the place-based nature

800
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
and then also the specific biology of

801
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,320
this ant where the forager was just so

802
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,080
clearly an expendable part of the

803
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,880
process of the colony like sloughed off

804
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
kind of and some other features of the

805
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,200
foraging biology of these ants

806
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
pretty interesting system and it reveals

807
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
a lot on like different cognitive

808
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
demands in different foraging

809
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
environments

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
so that's not even getting into the

811
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
whole mental foraging or affective

812
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,520
component but just at the ant foraging

813
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
level

814
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,840
i think you brought up an important

815
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
point though daniel and

816
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
i'm not sure if people associate

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
architecture

818
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
with abduction

819
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,200
but your your advisor supervisor

820
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
whatever her title was

821
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
her 30-year window

822
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,840
and then where you stepped in

823
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,320
for your five-year window

824
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,559
as nested

825
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,480
right right you you were the you were

826
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
the one now nested within a larger time

827
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,320
frame so back to blue's earlier point

828
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,799
but you weren't historically looking

829
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,840
back

830
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
from the perspective oh okay here's the

831
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,520
evolutionary nature you are now seeing

832
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,080
yourself as relative to something that

833
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,200
had a

834
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
a greater

835
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
um time stamp

836
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,799
right so you walked into the party and

837
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,440
you had to ask yourself did these ants

838
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,679
come from this colony

839
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
so back to purses

840
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,880
quick big question of right so it's when

841
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,200
i come into the situation that matters

842
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,840
as much as if i can

843
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,600
induce a skyscraper or deduce how much

844
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
structural rigidity that requires right

845
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,799
so i think this is kind of interesting

846
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,880
now because

847
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,440
i'm not sure if we should assume like

848
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,960
when you were talking about the

849
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,279
phylogenetic trees sometimes we just

850
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,080
assume where we're stepping in on the

851
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
on the

852
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
on the branching

853
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,640
but i'm not sure we should make that

854
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
assumption i think we have to be careful

855
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,200
to be as you said very explicit not just

856
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,519
assumptive of where we come in in this

857
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,320
history because if we don't we can end

858
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,159
up thinking that this is sort of a

859
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,080
linear layering

860
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,279
that figure four when when maybe it's

861
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,360
more like identity

862
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,840
it's it's both stable and dynamic

863
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,039
so it's definitely related to

864
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,919
almost the very first comments of blue

865
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,279
of like

866
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,279
where's multi-scale identity and

867
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,200
multi-scale systems

868
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,399
in this

869
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,199
hierarchical depth

870
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,399
it may be related in some way to um

871
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,000
multi-scale systems we could draw that

872
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,399
out but where is that nesting that we're

873
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,960
describing the real physical enclosure

874
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,919
sense

875
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,440
and this

876
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
way that mental systems can almost be

877
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,919
modeled as nested just like we saw

878
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,279
mental action

879
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,080
as a nesting of a cognitive model with

880
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
an action model inside of it

881
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,880
it's like the mental is enclosing and

882
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,399
even modeling

883
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,640
through inclusion of the parry personal

884
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
space but then with like a drop off

885
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,919
going further out

886
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,559
and then what is that

887
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,399
modeling

888
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,039
space and

889
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
is there another operation here again

890
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,279
what are these graphs what are we seeing

891
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,399
here

892
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,840
dean well my question is is does it

893
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
to answer blue's question does it do do

894
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
we get closer to a satisfactory answer

895
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
by looking at the mechanics of this or

896
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,519
do we get a better sense of it by seeing

897
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,039
the relationship like when you were

898
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,159
explaining the ant part you spent a lot

899
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
of time talking about relationship

900
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,559
and i think maybe

901
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,360
one of the things we try to do is we try

902
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
to apply the operation to it

903
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,519
when and when in fact what we should be

904
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,240
doing is seeing the relationship

905
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,720
in in its entirety i'm not don't want to

906
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,799
say zoom out

907
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,640
because you can still zoom out and still

908
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
get bogged down in the sequencing

909
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
because that's kind of what this does it

910
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,679
says this this layer of sequencing can

911
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,919
now build out fractal out into these

912
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,399
other layers of sequencing and i'm i'm

913
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,799
suggesting rather than seeing the layers

914
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,880
maybe it's the totality of the

915
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
relationships

916
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
i don't know because blue also pointed

917
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,159
to the social piece

918
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,079
which is all relationship all the time

919
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:10,960
right

920
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,480
so i'm just wondering if we help

921
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,079
ourselves

922
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,480
if we if we collapse to

923
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,320
oh well this is now explainable because

924
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
we have

925
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
some way of

926
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,918
showing the sequence

927
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,079
sometimes that helps but maybe in this

928
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,879
case

929
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
it's from a from an evolutionary

930
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,918
standpoint

931
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,440
it doesn't matter whether we're talking

932
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
about a hundred thousand years ago and

933
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,560
today as much as the relationship of

934
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,918
what 100 000 years ago and today

935
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,399
represents

936
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,520
i don't know

937
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,480
just throwing it out there

938
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
thanks for sharing it just one thought

939
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
on that and then we'll continue here

940
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,000
um

941
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,320
[Music]

942
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,159
phylogenetic trees

943
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,440
with genomic data are usually based upon

944
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,280
sequence alignment

945
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,359
followed by the fitting of a tree on the

946
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,240
aligned sections of the sequences

947
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
and so there's a lot of

948
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,040
ways and approaches of modeling from the

949
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,280
sequence alignment itself from unaligned

950
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
to align sequences a lot of ways you

951
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,040
could do it and then from the align

952
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
sequence matrix

953
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,839
to

954
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,359
the tree model there's a lot of ways to

955
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,880
do that it could be a bifurcating tree

956
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,839
it could be like a different kind of

957
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,760
tree different algorithms bayesian etc

958
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,839
one interesting point

959
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,200
that

960
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
many have raised but it's very

961
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
challenging to deal with

962
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
is that depending on how stringently you

963
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,520
align the sequences

964
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,839
different sites with different histories

965
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
or different information content

966
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
partially or

967
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
in totality

968
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
are being filtered out in a different

969
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,440
way

970
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
so if you have a mode of evolution where

971
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,119
like short chunks get interchanged so

972
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
that locally the sequences are not

973
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,880
changed like domains of a protein aren't

974
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,640
changed but then they're swapped in

975
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,920
order

976
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
those might become non-alignable

977
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,960
sequences

978
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,119
and so the hope is that those kinds of

979
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,960
genomic changes are

980
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,599
silent with respect to the long-term

981
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,680
evolutionary history of a species but in

982
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,599
the short term other methods might be

983
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,760
needed but in the long term it's the

984
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,440
hope that by pulling back like the

985
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,040
alignable sections you can get a good

986
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
signal and so that's a pretty

987
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,599
satisfactory approach when multiple

988
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,160
converging threads do

989
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
overwhelmingly agree

990
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
but it really shows that when there's

991
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,359
like a signal processing filtering

992
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,839
and then a model fitting

993
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,640
this

994
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,359
the

995
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,280
information in the data can be extremely

996
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,320
powerfully misleading

997
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
because there's so much because you're

998
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,320
getting exactly the same

999
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,240
post normalized data

1000
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,079
whether it was total

1001
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
noise in

1002
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,359
total bias out or whether your

1003
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,800
correction process

1004
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
over normalized for one thing or another

1005
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
those are kind of in that gray zone

1006
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
unknown unknown space

1007
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,560
coming into the searchlight

1008
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
and so there's the whole

1009
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
looking out of the searchlight story so

1010
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,160
maybe

1011
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
where do we situate active inference

1012
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,000
with respect to that

1013
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,720
um looking where the light is

1014
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,400
searching for one's keys etc etc

1015
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,520
so can i just say real quick i'm not i'm

1016
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
not advocating for

1017
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599
don't show your work

1018
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,680
i believe that showing your work really

1019
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,720
matters

1020
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,960
and then when you're trying to explain

1021
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
what's happening at a certain point

1022
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
don't get stuck in

1023
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,560
well this was this was the order of the

1024
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,359
steps that i took when i showed my work

1025
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,680
try and zoom out and try and understand

1026
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
what the relationship was well that's

1027
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,839
all i'm

1028
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,800
what i'm

1029
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
asking is that does that help

1030
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,480
being able to to to toggle back and

1031
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
forth

1032
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,040
so

1033
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
can i just jump in here for a second and

1034
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,000
point out that we had phylogenetic trees

1035
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
or we had

1036
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,760
yeah i guess

1037
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,440
um they weren't called phylogenetic

1038
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
trees at the time but we've had like

1039
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,599
speciation trees long before we had

1040
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,040
genetics right and so like we can

1041
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,839
construct them based on morphometric

1042
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,040
analysis

1043
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,839
and something that i liked in this paper

1044
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,400
is that it really um

1045
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,280
drew out the importance of the niche

1046
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,480
environment with respect to duplication

1047
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
because we saw many instances of species

1048
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
because we did these trees um

1049
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
when we didn't have genetic information

1050
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
and so we had all of these morphometric

1051
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
characteristics that we thought were

1052
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,040
similar and so we you know lumped these

1053
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,280
species together because they must be

1054
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
related because they share this

1055
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
morphometric feature but in many

1056
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,880
circumstances that was not the case and

1057
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,680
so because of of the similarity of the

1058
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,760
niche environment or even existing in

1059
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,240
the same niche you know we had evolution

1060
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,440
converge

1061
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
on this feature that was successful in

1062
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,839
that environment and so i think here

1063
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,079
like the idea of duplication and the

1064
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,359
authors got into that which i thought

1065
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,320
was really cool so so the same mechanism

1066
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
can evolve more than one time

1067
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,960
um in parallel just because of the

1068
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,079
fitting to the niche

1069
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
totally agree blue so when i said

1070
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,800
multiple conversion

1071
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,480
lines of evidence like what i was

1072
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
totally thinking of was how genomics the

1073
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
patterns that we get from those aligned

1074
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,599
sequences

1075
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,560
do

1076
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,720
recapitulate and even discover

1077
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,119
unexpected but later verified

1078
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,520
relationships and so that's sort of like

1079
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
a measure of the unique explanations and

1080
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
predictions but this tree

1081
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
could have been fit with phenotypic

1082
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
characters as you mentioned as it was

1083
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
for a long time and then it was just a

1084
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,320
few sites in proteins and that was sort

1085
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,520
of like the 1960s and 70s was fitting

1086
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,760
with very reduced data sets

1087
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
and now the amount of genomic data is

1088
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,839
rapidly increasing but out of the

1089
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,839
genomics analysis you know the action

1090
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,839
state of

1091
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,599
phylogenetics is really just this tree

1092
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,119
topology fit from a family of trees

1093
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,280
hopefully with an uncertainty

1094
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
associated whether they show it like

1095
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
with a bootstrap uncertainty or some

1096
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
other way but then

1097
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,960
that is an artifact now there's a few

1098
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,359
cases where like this is in itself

1099
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,480
interesting

1100
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
like when people have resolved some deep

1101
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,200
relationships within insects or other

1102
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,160
groups

1103
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
and then it helps structure thinking

1104
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
that can later be brought out about

1105
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,760
different traits and ecologies but it's

1106
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,880
like

1107
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,160
this is just a starting point for

1108
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,599
thinking about evolutionary histories

1109
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,160
and like you said similar

1110
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,599
um ecological or generative processes

1111
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,040
dynamics

1112
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,359
might beget

1113
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
increased likelihood for a certain

1114
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,839
generative model to

1115
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,760
arise and that's like kind of what

1116
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,800
ecosystem is like a desert seed

1117
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,440
harvesting ants whether it's in the

1118
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,960
mediterranean or the southwest u.s

1119
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,520
like pogonomyrmex in the u.s and then

1120
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
cataclyphus

1121
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,440
in them in the mediterranean regions

1122
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
like there's some similarities there but

1123
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
then there's other species that are more

1124
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,119
closely related that have a different

1125
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,160
foraging ecology

1126
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,359
so then

1127
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,400
how does the foraging strategy sometimes

1128
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
have extreme fidelity

1129
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,599
with the group

1130
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,079
like leaf cutter ants where once they're

1131
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,400
committed to being a full leaf cutter

1132
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
ant

1133
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,240
so to speak evolutionarily they don't or

1134
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,920
they haven't been observed to

1135
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,480
revert back to some other mode

1136
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
versus other like foraging strategies at

1137
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,960
the group level at the colony level

1138
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,319
but it's the individual in the other

1139
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,079
sense

1140
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,319
that's like very interesting thinking

1141
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,800
about foraging phenotypes on this tree

1142
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
and why not

1143
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,400
just like any other trait that you could

1144
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
study like the evolution of

1145
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,160
first spatial foraging

1146
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,200
and then

1147
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,800
the evolution of

1148
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,560
cognitive foraging

1149
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,839
and then applying that to different

1150
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,000
search spaces which was also explored a

1151
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
little in the um

1152
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,280
citations here the um foraging in mind

1153
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,480
and foraging and semantic fields

1154
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,720
papers what would you say blue

1155
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,920
well so it's cool that you brought that

1156
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
up daniel and just because in our

1157
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,839
past conversations you've brought up

1158
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,160
that the same species of ant have can

1159
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,200
have different

1160
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,520
foraging patterns based upon the colony

1161
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,240
that they live in i think that that's um

1162
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,520
super interesting and i wonder how like

1163
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,359
how could you

1164
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,319
map foraging patterns like can you put

1165
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,880
foraging patterns into a phylogenetic

1166
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
tree right like is there a tree

1167
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
structure that we could use to describe

1168
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,480
foraging patterns and would that relate

1169
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,319
to or map onto

1170
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
this brain structure tree in some way

1171
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,440
like is there i mean even i mean there's

1172
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,359
a lot of diversity within the same brain

1173
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,040
structure also like the ants have the

1174
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,880
same brain structure but you know even

1175
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,480
humans have like some of us go to the

1176
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
grocery store some some humans out there

1177
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,800
are still like hunting hunting and

1178
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,800
gathering you know to make their food so

1179
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,560
awesome wait oh yeah dean go for it

1180
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,079
first

1181
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,599
so you guys can

1182
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,760
learn learn me school me on something

1183
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,359
here so

1184
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,760
is there any evidence that ants all

1185
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,359
gather in the morning

1186
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,400
and

1187
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,440
the

1188
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,920
queen ant or whatever the organizing at

1189
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,640
the principal and pulls the map out and

1190
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,839
says

1191
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,920
now i want you to take this thing that

1192
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,280
you've mapped

1193
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,760
and carry it out today

1194
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
and i'm not being a smart aleck i'm

1195
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,160
asking is there some sort of

1196
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,440
analogous

1197
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
evidence that they

1198
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,839
do

1199
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,400
that

1200
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
okay so to the um

1201
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,040
uh team huddle

1202
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
uh monday morning stand up

1203
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,359
no

1204
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
i hope that's not over generalizing

1205
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,319
because ants are also of course very

1206
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,000
diverse in their foraging strategies and

1207
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,520
a lot is unknown

1208
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
but just speaking to the first

1209
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,040
approximation the queen is not a central

1210
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,480
decision maker

1211
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
in information router

1212
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,480
hormonally and at a slower time scale

1213
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,880
for sure but at the behavioral

1214
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
regulation level

1215
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
now

1216
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,800
in the morning for the pogonomyrex

1217
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,000
they would like

1218
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
chill and some would

1219
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,440
slowly come out and

1220
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
like their walking speed is temperature

1221
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,359
dependent like all insects and it just

1222
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,079
assessing maybe the humidity or

1223
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,400
damage around the nest entrance

1224
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
so there's no reason why those

1225
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,520
archetypes like convergence um before

1226
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
planning or

1227
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,440
rupture repair which of course cannot

1228
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,160
have a planning component directly

1229
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,520
different algorithms are going to have

1230
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,920
different

1231
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
levels there but because the

1232
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,839
um

1233
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,680
ants

1234
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,400
symbolic behavioral communication is

1235
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,760
pretty low bandwidth probably

1236
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
so unlike the waggle dance which is

1237
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,800
conveying like quite a lot from an

1238
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
information theory perspective

1239
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,040
using symbolic means like the direction

1240
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,599
and the distance and and also chemical

1241
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,599
information like about the flowers

1242
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,520
um there's ants that like

1243
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,440
physically pull another of their nest

1244
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,280
mate to a foraging location so using

1245
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,560
memory or pheromone or like tandem run

1246
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,480
and there's probably some limited

1247
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,560
examples of being able to do some like a

1248
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,720
little bit higher order signaling and

1249
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,319
also of course the smell of the food and

1250
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,760
the pheromone and so a lot of the

1251
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
extended features

1252
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,960
um but they don't do a pow-wow with the

1253
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,400
queen

1254
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,640
okay so let me

1255
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,480
let me take what you just said and sort

1256
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,280
of feed back and maybe build on it a bit

1257
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
so you described a situation it's

1258
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,720
morning if morning then aunt behaves

1259
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,000
like so and in the last slide of

1260
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,680
this deck

1261
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,040
and the phylogenetic tree you had then

1262
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,440
to now or then if

1263
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,680
so what i'm wondering is

1264
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,880
can we can we exist in a sequential

1265
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,480
world of if then

1266
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,359
like an as a homeostatic representation

1267
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,839
is if then all we need but if we want to

1268
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,599
include temporal depth

1269
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,480
and higher hierarchical depth

1270
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,880
we actually incorporate the inversion of

1271
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,160
that we incorporate the then if

1272
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,200
right

1273
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,680
so that's my question so to blue's point

1274
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,359
earlier

1275
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,920
where where where is

1276
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,599
where is this

1277
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,560
this shift or this sense of

1278
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
what's going on the relationship it

1279
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,160
might be

1280
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,240
the discrepancy at the for the first

1281
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,839
representation figure one the

1282
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,000
discrepancy might be

1283
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,599
those people that are looking at things

1284
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,079
from an if then perspective

1285
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,599
if this

1286
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,599
then we should expect that from a

1287
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,720
predictive standpoint versus the then if

1288
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,280
perspective uh

1289
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,880
then

1290
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,720
then the the

1291
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,440
the critical call had to be made as

1292
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
the base runner was foraging for second

1293
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,040
base

1294
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,839
and a call was made now

1295
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,480
if now a whole bunch of people

1296
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,440
chime in about what their interpretation

1297
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,400
of what just happened

1298
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,760
right so again i'm not sure if that's

1299
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
i'm not sure if only looking at it

1300
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,160
frontwards and backwards as it's a point

1301
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
as a sequence

1302
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,599
is enough i think we also have to be

1303
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,240
able to see the relationship of if then

1304
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,119
and then if from the historical

1305
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,520
view and i think when we do that we go

1306
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,040
from

1307
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
architectural existence to architectural

1308
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,078
learning

1309
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,160
okay

1310
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
let me try to restate that but i've not

1311
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,800
lost the foraging trail

1312
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,800
so yeah if the um outcome is like um

1313
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,319
the end point

1314
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,280
then

1315
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,720
that's the uh if then uh that's the if

1316
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,200
then if the person

1317
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,599
committed the crime you do the time

1318
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,240
and then um

1319
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,359
the sort of then if takes it it

1320
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,359
precludes if then in multiple sequences

1321
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,480
of if then and uncertainties on if thens

1322
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,559
and then it says okay then or it's like

1323
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,640
if then if so we're kind of

1324
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
down

1325
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,880
and then that's where the outcome is a

1326
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,280
starting point and so that is in one

1327
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,800
sense it's teleological because it's end

1328
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,240
directed like where is this project

1329
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,800
gonna go do we really expect and prefer

1330
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,920
to publish his paper on february 28th

1331
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,359
and then also

1332
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,079
it includes the next steps so it creates

1333
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,920
a world model where

1334
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,720
there is a possible which is a

1335
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,200
selectable set of policies that the team

1336
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,720
will achieve like that expected and

1337
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,520
preferred outcome and then it sets it up

1338
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
for what would be the obvious next loop

1339
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,200
of policy selection and so if it's like

1340
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
if things are this good or bad with the

1341
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,920
environment in 2030 then this is how

1342
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,720
much damage will go to this or this way

1343
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
even if you were right

1344
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,599
it wouldn't

1345
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,640
involve the policy selection element

1346
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,839
and so

1347
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,440
that's probably a complex situation with

1348
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,920
the partitioning of like estimation and

1349
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,079
world policy selection which is clearly

1350
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,000
a separate discussion that's not only

1351
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,079
being invoked here like as an example

1352
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,480
but it just points to how those are

1353
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,720
different components of inference and

1354
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,240
then foraging like

1355
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,200
an example of if then and then as if or

1356
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,760
then if was like

1357
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,960
sometimes

1358
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
the colonies would pack their nest

1359
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
entrance with pebbles

1360
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,319
and then there'd be a thunderstorm

1361
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,079
in the afternoon

1362
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,160
i don't think a study has ever it's a

1363
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,680
totally widely observed behavior with

1364
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,520
many animals and was no exception with

1365
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,880
harvester ants

1366
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,800
now maybe there's thunderstorms where

1367
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,359
they fail to make pebbles or it not

1368
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,559
enough

1369
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,160
and there's probably some false

1370
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,000
positives too so we don't really know

1371
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,359
the exact

1372
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,960
success ratio maybe it's better than the

1373
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,720
previous day's forecast maybe it's worse

1374
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,559
but

1375
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,960
it's very clear to see that the nest

1376
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,760
mate doesn't need to have been

1377
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,240
inheriting from its evolutionary history

1378
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,920
and its niche

1379
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,480
raincloud modeling software

1380
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,800
it's just picking up pebbles with a

1381
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,119
proclivity to interactions and humidity

1382
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,400
etc

1383
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,839
that help colonies that have that

1384
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,920
proclivity succeed in that niche

1385
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,119
which doesn't even mean that it was a

1386
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,839
popular phenotype like 20 years ago

1387
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,920
as things change in a region

1388
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,720
so that's like super interesting

1389
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
um

1390
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,400
let's return to foraging

1391
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,280
and the foraging variation question but

1392
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,520
first let's see if we've completed the

1393
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,040
figure four

1394
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,400
discussion

1395
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,720
okay and um just like is there anything

1396
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,280
else we want to add about like the main

1397
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
because this is kind of what the paper

1398
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,040
works towards

1399
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,400
and then there's like a little downhill

1400
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,559
roll is like we could do this algebra on

1401
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,599
the tree

1402
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,440
but this is sort of where things get led

1403
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,400
up to

1404
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
through demonstration of the motifs and

1405
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,440
the connection between cognition

1406
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,000
and structures and structure learning

1407
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,160
and then like parameter learning

1408
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,000
at a behavioral or developmental time

1409
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,040
scale

1410
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,040
and then structure changes over

1411
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,200
evolutionary time scales

1412
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,720
so we have

1413
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,960
hierarchical depth temporal depth which

1414
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,160
we're also just kind of adding in a

1415
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,920
spatial component

1416
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,359
allostat

1417
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,480
which was

1418
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,839
um used in the paper with the

1419
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,680
intermodality but

1420
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,760
maybe it could be other modalities

1421
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,359
or same

1422
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,359
there's duplication which is kind of

1423
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,960
like parallelization that's like adding

1424
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,520
another nest mate or another unit to the

1425
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,280
compound eye of a insect developmentally

1426
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,720
and then

1427
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
i is homeostasis which is being

1428
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,680
used here as sort of the

1429
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,720
um

1430
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,400
base or root or ancestral case

1431
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,920
which is referring at the behavioral

1432
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,720
time scale to return to us to a stable

1433
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,760
point

1434
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,680
and then also at the more evolutionary

1435
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,599
time scale the eye operator on the

1436
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,920
homeostat it's like the homeostasis on

1437
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,359
homeostasis

1438
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,920
it's keeping the structure of that model

1439
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,040
fixed

1440
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,280
and then when the homeostasis at the

1441
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,680
evolutionary time scale is open

1442
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,319
then the structural transformations here

1443
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,800
are like the affordances from that base

1444
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,640
case which is what's being shown like

1445
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,960
with the main one on the left being

1446
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,400
broken into these

1447
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
and then each of these become the prior

1448
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,599
for each of these next ones

1449
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,520
anything to add or we go to foraging

1450
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,680
okay

1451
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,359
so

1452
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,359
great

1453
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,040
relevant question blue

1454
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,920
measuring foraging so one paper though

1455
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
there's a bunch that are really relevant

1456
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,480
but

1457
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,200
um michelle lenon 2014

1458
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,280
did a lot of literature review

1459
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,920
and visualizations of foraging

1460
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,599
strategies in

1461
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,839
different ant species so

1462
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,160
um these are like some of the foraging

1463
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,520
approaches

1464
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,760
like foraging archetypes

1465
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,079
um and then

1466
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,880
uh

1467
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,079
categorized those into

1468
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,720
different traits on a tree

1469
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,480
and um

1470
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,440
so that's an awesome work and

1471
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,119
something that could and should be

1472
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,599
extended and integrated with like modern

1473
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,720
databases so that somebody could submit

1474
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,880
we just saw this one going in a trail

1475
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,000
and then that kind of reduces our

1476
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,760
uncertainty about a broader model of

1477
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,160
ant foraging because it's like oh that's

1478
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,400
a surprising observation about this

1479
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,240
given what we already knew about that

1480
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,079
species for example

1481
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,480
but how do you actually measure foraging

1482
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,319
variation within or across the species

1483
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,040
so

1484
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,520
in this case

1485
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,640
these um in figure one these are like

1486
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,400
kind of like the structure

1487
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
at one level they're like archetypes of

1488
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,520
structure

1489
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,079
now sometimes they probably blur within

1490
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,720
each other like if it's two

1491
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,000
then it's tandem running but if it's

1492
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,079
three is it a group or is it still like

1493
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,000
pseudo tandem running you know so it

1494
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,200
could be a little

1495
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,559
blurriness and also there could be

1496
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,400
different modes

1497
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,480
even within the same species

1498
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,760
or like a

1499
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,000
in a continuum between a foraging column

1500
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,319
with like a trunk and a spread versus

1501
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,799
like just a spread so this is sort of

1502
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,319
like yeah

1503
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,760
i've got i've got to like just jump in

1504
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,240
and say like how these look like neurons

1505
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,319
like just with like different axons and

1506
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,920
like uh

1507
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,240
dendritic arbors like i'm like these are

1508
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,319
like different brain structures so i

1509
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,839
just had to like point that out because

1510
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,520
that's cool yeah the bottom one

1511
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,720
definitely does

1512
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,599
um even both of these and even this top

1513
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,599
one too the trunk trails

1514
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,839
and the yeah yeah so

1515
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,040
and

1516
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,079
and uh

1517
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,920
let's just say that these are sort of

1518
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
archetypes within a broader space

1519
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,680
and then

1520
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,100
within a given um

1521
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,200
[Music]

1522
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,280
mode

1523
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,599
then the behavioral ecologist will tend

1524
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,240
to make like a more specific measure so

1525
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,799
let's just say it's a 100 a trail

1526
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,720
forager then

1527
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,680
having the counts to and from on the

1528
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,880
trail

1529
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,119
is a good measure so like in the

1530
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,640
harvester ants they

1531
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,799
most basically do this trunk trail on

1532
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:43,920
the top

1533
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,079
so there would be like one or two or

1534
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,119
three

1535
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,040
main avenues that they were leaving the

1536
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,119
colony in for that day and then

1537
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,960
sometimes it'd be the same day-to-day

1538
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,480
other times it would be slightly

1539
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,079
different

1540
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,240
but then what happens when one wanders

1541
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,440
off not on a trail is it still a forager

1542
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,079
and a lot of that space

1543
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,280
is um

1544
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,359
really interesting but suffice to say

1545
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,760
that once a foraging definition has been

1546
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
selected like not just the class that

1547
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,680
it's going to be but also how it's going

1548
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,839
to be measured in that study

1549
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,400
then there can be like quantitative

1550
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,280
parameter comparisons like this colony

1551
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,440
foraged at this rate

1552
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,680
in terms of number of outgoing foragers

1553
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,920
per minute and then its neighboring

1554
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,720
colony of the same species was doing at

1555
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,319
this rate so you can do like parameter

1556
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,400
comparisons within the species kind of

1557
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,960
at the population level and then

1558
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,799
there might be another ant species whose

1559
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,079
activity it doesn't really make to

1560
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,839
compare because it's like a different

1561
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,119
number of nest mates it has a different

1562
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,280
foraging ecology so that's kind of where

1563
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
like the structure learning

1564
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,520
would come into play with comparing the

1565
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,599
ants that are tending the scale insects

1566
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,720
versus foraging for seeds versus

1567
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,799
doing whatever else they do and then

1568
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,799
within a species

1569
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,559
or perhaps across a few species that

1570
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,839
have a similar

1571
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,240
foraging ecology it's possible to do

1572
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,879
parametric comparisons

1573
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,960
um

1574
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
so i have a question for you daniel yeah

1575
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,119
where does how does foraging fit

1576
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,839
architecture

1577
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:24,839
what do you

1578
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,599
think no i'm i mean i'm not trying to be

1579
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,599
a smart alec here i'm i'm really curious

1580
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,920
because most architectural

1581
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,200
analogies

1582
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,040
result in some sort of an outcome that's

1583
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,040
static like there's a lot of processing

1584
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,960
that went into the outcome

1585
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,640
but the outcome is static and i don't

1586
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,880
think that any of the representations in

1587
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,720
the in the frame that you're moving

1588
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,160
right now

1589
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,920
although the the represent the

1590
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,200
differences

1591
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,599
are appear as static they're they're

1592
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,040
supposed to be representing the

1593
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,240
something that's quite dynamic

1594
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,920
so that's where the question of the

1595
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,599
architecture piece

1596
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,880
blended with evolution

1597
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,079
might be helpful or it might be

1598
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,319
oxymoronic

1599
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,920
depending upon how you how you interpret

1600
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,839
it right

1601
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,520
so so

1602
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,799
nothing architecture implies like

1603
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,400
there's an architect

1604
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,200
i don't know like in an evolutionary

1605
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,720
sense i'm not sure like architecture is

1606
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,400
the right word it's weird

1607
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,680
yeah

1608
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,520
and i'm not saying it's wrong i'm just

1609
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,720
saying you have to be really really

1610
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
careful and then what you what

1611
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,960
assumptions you come in with based on

1612
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,440
what you think architecture is

1613
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,520
you're yeah you're maybe you're thinking

1614
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,040
it the way i am i'm not saying it's

1615
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,000
wrong i'm just saying

1616
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,079
what baggage does that carry

1617
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,440
when we're talking about something

1618
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,960
that's actually quite

1619
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,119
quite dynamic

1620
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,359
those ants those ants are i mean you can

1621
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,599
see the ants and the ant hill

1622
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,839
as an architecture yes you can take a

1623
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,359
snapshot of it

1624
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,040
but is that what we're really talking

1625
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,839
about when we're talking about

1626
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,480
foraging

1627
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,680
so what's the difference between a

1628
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,160
structure and an architecture i remember

1629
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,880
that

1630
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,119
yeah

1631
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,720
is it just

1632
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,400
it's just semantics

1633
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,720
yeah i think it's more than that but we

1634
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,359
just have to be careful that we don't

1635
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,960
we don't um

1636
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,720
insert one for the other thinking that

1637
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,760
they're the same thing that's what the

1638
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,400
whole ontology exercise is about i mean

1639
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,720
i got my mind changed okay normally i'm

1640
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,799
the one that argues that don't don't

1641
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,960
give somebody an owner's manual get them

1642
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,559
behind the wheel

1643
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,559
right they'll they'll see their owner's

1644
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,200
manual later but in this particular case

1645
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,799
i'm kind of going wait a second we

1646
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,400
better all agree what we're talking

1647
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
about so so here it is what's the

1648
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,599
difference between structure and

1649
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,760
architecture structure tends to be the

1650
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
pieces and the parts of the design and

1651
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,079
how it goes together and the finished

1652
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,119
object

1653
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,280
architecture defines how the final

1654
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,240
object looks behaves and costs

1655
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,440
by designating how design choices are

1656
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,440
made so architecture implies that

1657
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,000
there's some kind of agency behind the

1658
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,839
design and that's kind of that was kind

1659
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,640
of my interpretation of it also

1660
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,599
okay

1661
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,960
oh

1662
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,280
oh okay a bunch of stuff there

1663
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,799
that last point would like the

1664
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,640
definition of architecture involve the

1665
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,599
choices rather than structure involving

1666
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,599
just the uh description of parts so

1667
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,040
that's kind of like

1668
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,680
the perception variational free energy

1669
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,040
that's like structure

1670
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,559
it also means the entire thing so it's

1671
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,079
not just the parts it also means the

1672
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,799
entire object yes but it still doesn't

1673
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,880
involve preferences or choices it's

1674
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,799
about description like perceptual

1675
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,319
processing is and then the architectural

1676
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,040
definition has like choices in it

1677
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,160
and then that is what you brought to

1678
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,880
like agency and also architecture

1679
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,760
um

1680
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,359
it's like a profession and an

1681
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,280
operational approach

1682
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,040
to modeling the process of building a

1683
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,079
building though there's probably

1684
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,280
theoretical

1685
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,480
and basic

1686
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,240
architecture and all this other stuff

1687
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,160
okay but just a few

1688
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,920
thoughts here on like the

1689
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,839
engineering and designing

1690
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,559
so i guess one ontology that can be

1691
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,079
helpful here is

1692
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,640
with uh bucky fuller talking about

1693
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,880
structural integrity which is something

1694
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,680
that has static holding strength like a

1695
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,760
metal cube

1696
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,960
has static holding strength um

1697
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,200
then there's process or the pattern

1698
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,319
integrity

1699
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,920
which is sort of like describing the

1700
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,760
life cycle of the butterfly in the

1701
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,359
caterpillar like a recapitulation of

1702
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,720
process

1703
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,079
and that is a lot more like this sort of

1704
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,839
dynamic systems

1705
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,040
approach

1706
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,880
to

1707
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,160
organization

1708
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,799
rather than the build it and lock it

1709
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,319
approach because these multi-skill

1710
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:51,599
systems always have things that are

1711
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,960
turning over at different time scales

1712
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,160
um

1713
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,920
and then there's just so many mechanisms

1714
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,839
that that can be modeled

1715
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,039
by or actually occurs by like just in

1716
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,720
the harvester ants

1717
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,400
it's the historiosity

1718
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,440
of that

1719
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,960
colony over the years then the nest mate

1720
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,839
and that day and its visual memory and

1721
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,200
just

1722
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,960
how many factors come into play then

1723
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,720
every foraging trip at an estimate level

1724
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,880
could be seen as unique and the exact

1725
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,200
combinations will just never be

1726
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,799
recapitulated

1727
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,880
some of the major ones can be

1728
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,039
explored and then controlled for or

1729
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,880
tested for in a lab but

1730
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,400
that's part of the

1731
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,720
open-endedness of dynamical systems

1732
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,280
because by changing the setting

1733
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,760
you can study certain features

1734
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
but then it's another step

1735
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,720
that's impossible in practice

1736
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,400
to understand how those features that

1737
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,160
were in a different environment

1738
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,559
translate to the first environment

1739
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,319
so you can take the essential behavior

1740
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,720
of the traffic jam and then recapitulate

1741
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,079
it with the simulation the lab

1742
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,480
experiment and all this

1743
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,559
but it's a different thing to actually

1744
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,880
put it into the design time

1745
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,160
which is happening at a different time

1746
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,920
scale than just building the skyscraper

1747
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,920
and leaving it there but that's more

1748
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,599
like the dynamic organism

1749
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,720
so where's foraging on this

1750
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,720
and i would ask where's is there a

1751
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,920
different kind of foraging if we're

1752
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,039
talking about

1753
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,280
sort of the sort of the

1754
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,079
the

1755
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,920
machine learning type of foraging on

1756
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,799
this

1757
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:31,920
versus the

1758
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,119
the

1759
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,559
wet

1760
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,440
foraging of an ant

1761
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,599
like is that can we actually see

1762
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,760
that those two things being quite

1763
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,480
different in terms of how those two for

1764
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,599
foraging types plays out or are they

1765
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,319
do do we do we do we focus on the things

1766
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,520
that are different about those two

1767
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,520
things or do we focus about on the

1768
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
things that are the same about those two

1769
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,640
types of forging

1770
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,680
blue also with your foraging from a more

1771
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,880
cultural

1772
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,920
and human perspective

1773
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,359
for machine learning and foraging

1774
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,240
so

1775
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,240
machine learning and foraging i mean so

1776
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,400
yeah so i've done some modeling of

1777
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,480
foraging with like agent-based modeling

1778
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,880
but um

1779
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,119
in machine learning i wonder like

1780
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,559
i mean i know that there's information

1781
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,319
for origin but that's usually explored

1782
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,640
from the human context right like humans

1783
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,839
going out and looking for information

1784
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,280
and how long we stay on the website and

1785
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,240
whatever

1786
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,200
so

1787
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,960
but um

1788
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,319
i wonder about machine learning and

1789
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,880
like you know neural networks doing

1790
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,839
object classification like is there a

1791
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,240
foraging that they do there like you

1792
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,359
know they pick up things like um

1793
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,760
uh chris ola wrote a really awesome

1794
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,160
publication about um

1795
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,160
you know how we understand how neural

1796
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,200
networks work and they kind of

1797
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,839
deconstruct deep dream uh that's on onto

1798
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,440
still pub which is really cool it was

1799
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,000
like a 2018 paper but you know they look

1800
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,720
at

1801
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,839
how how does a neural network recognize

1802
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,039
a dog you know and or a dog in a tennis

1803
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,760
ball so they look for like round object

1804
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,720
and like uh you know floppy ear like so

1805
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,799
there's like different neurons in the in

1806
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,880
the neural network that'll like learn

1807
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,799
what is a floppy ear or learn what is

1808
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,119
like a round object and so like it's

1809
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,720
this combination of different things

1810
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,960
that that the neural network learns

1811
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,280
that's pieced together to form like this

1812
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,839
is a dog with a tennis ball um which is

1813
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,680
it's a super interesting way to think

1814
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
about it and i wonder like in training

1815
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,119
neural network

1816
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,319
um

1817
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,200
can that be looked at as as a type of uh

1818
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,799
information forging right like the

1819
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,520
network is setting out to learn distinct

1820
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,599
pieces of a pattern that it'll later

1821
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,559
like

1822
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,839
piece together to to make its complete

1823
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,599
image recognition

1824
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:00,480
so

1825
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,720
um

1826
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,480
interesting

1827
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,839
i'll give a

1828
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,599
thought on the machine learning in the

1829
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,559
and the bio foraging

1830
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,200
so you mentioned like what's

1831
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,640
well there's the question of should we

1832
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,000
approach it from a similarities or a

1833
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,680
different perspective and there's

1834
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,039
different reasons why you might approach

1835
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,400
different angles right like what is the

1836
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,319
most pedagogical to someone learning

1837
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,160
about the difference versus what is the

1838
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,079
best way to approach this to a certain

1839
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,000
stakeholder who is actually applying

1840
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,200
this question in a certain context

1841
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,119
but to get to the question outside of

1842
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,440
that um

1843
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,520
the idea of contrast came to mind

1844
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,319
because we recently had the model stream

1845
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,799
on contrastive active inference which

1846
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,079
used machine learning so check out that

1847
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,000
stream but it involved a contrasting

1848
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,960
step

1849
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,400
of processing inputs before doing policy

1850
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,920
selection etc so that helps

1851
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,160
scenes that are broadly similar but have

1852
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,760
a key difference that's small like where

1853
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,760
the ping pong ball is can be learnt

1854
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,599
better because there's a contrasting and

1855
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,440
that reminds me of language learning

1856
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,400
when it's like here's

1857
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,920
and here's

1858
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,839
and then that's a contrast that isn't

1859
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,039
going to come up in the language but

1860
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,440
then it helps learn on that

1861
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,119
and that's not just a machine learning

1862
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,920
thing because even in the parametric

1863
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,119
modeling

1864
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,960
of spm

1865
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,680
statistical parametric modeling

1866
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,960
mapping

1867
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,480
but the model making of it

1868
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,960
the contrast matrix is the experimental

1869
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,920
design

1870
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,200
and so if it's just condition a and

1871
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,400
condition b and you have ten

1872
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
measurements it's just five of a you

1873
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,559
know five zeros and five ones

1874
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,520
and that's like the true or false matrix

1875
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,520
that basically gets multiplied to do

1876
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,880
statistics on

1877
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,960
so whether it's a very

1878
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,200
classical parametric

1879
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,280
sparse modeling approach which was

1880
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,799
initially all that

1881
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,680
was had by statisticians or whether it

1882
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,720
is now

1883
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,640
things that are

1884
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,160
highly parametric

1885
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,839
or just all this other stuff with modern

1886
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,000
machine learning the contrast is like

1887
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,920
this key piece

1888
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,680
because it's always about what signal is

1889
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,280
being detected

1890
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,920
within a data set and then also how the

1891
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,920
difference between that sample

1892
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,319
and the population is being modeled

1893
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,080
and so like in parametric statistics

1894
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,080
that's about the sample standard

1895
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,520
deviation and then there's a slightly

1896
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,960
different equation for like the

1897
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,960
population standard deviation if you

1898
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,799
would have kept on sampling and then

1899
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,640
it's also sometimes hard to incorporate

1900
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,080
that kind of a

1901
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,799
reasoning into these more

1902
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,120
modern statistical systems where it's

1903
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,279
like very easy to over fit

1904
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,719
because there's a lot of data but it's

1905
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,399
hard to model how that large chunk of

1906
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,880
data is related to even other segments

1907
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,080
of data

1908
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,759
so it's similar to the phylogenetic

1909
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,158
challenge but that is one that is like

1910
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:51,920
searching for contrast takes on a very

1911
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,480
different meaning

1912
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,120
but

1913
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,399
how is it related to foraging

1914
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,359
there's the info foraging like blue

1915
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,960
mentioned

1916
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,198
there's the path element of foraging

1917
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,960
which might be related to like inferring

1918
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,158
the best

1919
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,319
info foraging path for somebody on their

1920
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,359
feed

1921
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,520
because it has to balance

1922
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,759
the epistemic in the pragmatic or at

1923
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,520
least it acts as if it balances the

1924
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,920
epistemic and the pragmatic so

1925
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,719
um

1926
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,399
forging could be

1927
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,560
maybe looked at in that way

1928
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:28,859
um

1929
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,399
[Music]

1930
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,399
yeah dean

1931
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,880
i think what this i think what this

1932
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,198
this slide represents is broadly

1933
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:38,479
speaking

1934
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,238
not just or broadly identity um

1935
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,238
i think we what we do is in that in that

1936
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,399
diagram we we tend to differentiate we

1937
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,560
see the levels because we've created the

1938
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,199
partitions

1939
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,080
we see the dependencies because over on

1940
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,560
the far left we have actual blue arrows

1941
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,480
that that show what that those

1942
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,920
dependencies are

1943
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,400
and then we reintegrate

1944
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,280
right

1945
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,080
um

1946
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,239
i remember when i was doing my i always

1947
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,520
come back to the programming that i was

1948
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,440
doing but i used to say to the kids i

1949
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
mean there's a there's a migration piece

1950
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,199
to this that we have to develop which i

1951
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,280
would consider to be the tactics which

1952
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,199
would include foraging

1953
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,520
and then there's a tools use

1954
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,360
or a strategy piece which is sort of the

1955
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,640
information

1956
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,960
covered as change as measured which is

1957
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,400
kind of the instrument

1958
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,080
instrument piece

1959
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,400
and what i kept saying to them was

1960
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,480
you kind of need to have both

1961
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,080
all the time you don't need to know the

1962
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,760
difference between

1963
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,159
something that's a migration

1964
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,080
or an action

1965
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
or a fulfillment in the sort of the

1966
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,440
physical space

1967
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,679
and the tools sort of the thinking

1968
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,239
instrumental parts where you can

1969
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,920
turn what you're seeing into these

1970
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,880
models and these representations

1971
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,040
and you have to kind of be able to marry

1972
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,400
the two of them all the time you have to

1973
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,199
be able to integrate them across

1974
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,640
these boundaries when you're trying to

1975
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,800
get into these professional settings now

1976
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,679
that

1977
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,480
that isn't a construction exercise

1978
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,880
that's that's being creative because you

1979
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,640
really don't know at the end of the day

1980
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,480
how it's going to turn out

1981
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,560
but but the but the big point that we

1982
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,960
were trying to make was don't leave one

1983
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,640
of those two things

1984
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,360
behind like don't get stuck

1985
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,520
because you can't go out and forage

1986
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,760
don't get stuck because you don't think

1987
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,400
you can draw the perfect representation

1988
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,640
of the world it's just an instrument

1989
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,920
right it's

1990
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,560
i mean even a spoon can eventually drain

1991
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,640
an ocean if you're prepared to spend

1992
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,280
enough time on it so

1993
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,480
i think that's what this representation

1994
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,840
i think that's one of the greatest gifts

1995
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,920
of this representation is it kind of

1996
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,159
lays out very clearly that there's two

1997
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,600
parts to this

1998
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,159
how we differentiate

1999
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,360
on different

2000
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,960
eventually on different

2001
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,400
duplication parallel parallelization

2002
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,199
um dependency

2003
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,080
predictability

2004
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,719
preferential

2005
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,760
time based and spatial based and then

2006
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,280
scale based

2007
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,239
and then

2008
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,080
reintegrate it all back together into

2009
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,320
some sort of a coherency

2010
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,760
for some people though i think it's kind

2011
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,960
of dense

2012
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,280
i mean if you walked in today

2013
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,320
gee i don't know what kind of

2014
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,840
prerequisites you would need what kind

2015
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,920
of priors you would need to understand

2016
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,760
what the heck we're talking about

2017
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,320
but as i said for me the the entry point

2018
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,360
the lowest level was do you migrate

2019
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,120
do you tool use

2020
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,520
most people already admit they can find

2021
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,360
examples when they do both

2022
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,239
so my question then would be so will you

2023
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,320
know that you're doing both

2024
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,640
going forward and then and if you can do

2025
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,600
that

2026
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,239
maybe it's not quite so

2027
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,000
quite so dense or quite so

2028
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,719
mystifying

2029
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,920
a few things there so

2030
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,760
great point that

2031
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,440
going foraging

2032
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,719
on your merry way without having all

2033
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,320
hidden states

2034
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,120
learned at the structural level

2035
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,199
or the parametric level even conditioned

2036
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,040
on a structure so you don't even know

2037
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,400
what's out there

2038
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,719
no cognitive agent does

2039
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,480
and at the structural and parametric

2040
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,600
level

2041
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,760
the inference challenge is about action

2042
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,320
selection under uncertainty

2043
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,920
of multiple types

2044
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,679
the inference challenge

2045
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:30,480
is

2046
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,760
of action having sub problems involving

2047
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,840
inference on perception and causal

2048
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,360
modeling but those are like little sub

2049
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,679
problems within a broader frame that

2050
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,600
active inference provides of like action

2051
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,040
orientation

2052
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,199
action on policy selection and then

2053
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,040
foraging is a great

2054
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,199
setting to study policy selection

2055
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,960
and then you brought up like that

2056
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,440
there's prerequisites that we hope to

2057
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,920
learn what different backgrounds can

2058
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,719
come to active inference from but like

2059
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,080
i think one takeaway from the paper

2060
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,440
would be that perhaps

2061
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,199
our cog in a forging structure

2062
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,960
whatever that means

2063
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,640
but the way that we forage through

2064
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,640
linguistic and idea space and solution

2065
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,719
space strategy space

2066
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,679
can be modeled by some graph motifs and

2067
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,520
classes and transformations which is

2068
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,400
what the contribution of this paper is

2069
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,480
and they also describe some of the more

2070
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
basal or homeostatic ancestral

2071
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,640
structures so it's like you have a

2072
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,960
linear model that works for height data

2073
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,040
and it works for weight data and it

2074
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,120
works for height and weight together

2075
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,560
it's just any numbers you pass to the

2076
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,360
linear model the glm it's going to be

2077
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,719
basically okay

2078
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,199
this is like another model class

2079
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,640
that can take

2080
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,320
or apply to

2081
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,080
cognitive modeling

2082
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,840
homeostatic modeling

2083
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,640
cognitive and homeostatic modeling

2084
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,080
all these variations that are being

2085
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,960
described here so that's just one way to

2086
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,000
put it with

2087
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,560
perhaps fewer prerequisites

2088
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,320
and then these were interesting

2089
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,679
questions

2090
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,159
is this what it was do you migrate and

2091
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,000
do you use tools

2092
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,600
yeah

2093
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,120
so if you're if you're doing and when

2094
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,719
you're talking about tools are you

2095
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,800
talking about provisions

2096
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,760
and especially if you

2097
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,159
if you come to breakfast with a plan

2098
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,560
on how to build a spoon

2099
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,000
how is that going to help you eat your

2100
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,960
cereal

2101
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,360
when when you're when you're foraging

2102
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,679
exercise was to be able to move the

2103
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,440
cereal from the bowl

2104
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,040
into your mouth

2105
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,440
right so lots of times especially in

2106
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,199
some of the more

2107
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,360
conventional ways we look at things we

2108
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,520
tend to take the plan

2109
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,920
to the to the cereal bowl instead of the

2110
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,360
actual spoon

2111
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,440
so the provisioning part is more than a

2112
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,880
plan

2113
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
it's more than the words and it's more

2114
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,520
than the representations it's the actual

2115
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,640
implements

2116
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,400
that we carry with us when we do that

2117
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,159
migration

2118
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,760
that i think really counts because if

2119
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,840
you carry a i guess i guess you can

2120
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,320
origami a sheet of paper

2121
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,560
into a spoon

2122
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,400
but then that's another process that you

2123
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,320
have to go through and really what you

2124
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,840
wanted was just

2125
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
to have the implement

2126
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,000
so

2127
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,199
so when you talk about migration

2128
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,960
like how far

2129
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,199
is the migration like if you're a single

2130
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,120
cellular organism like you know

2131
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,120
migrating through the ocean

2132
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,679
like um

2133
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,360
maybe the migration in that case is

2134
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,280
moving around you right

2135
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,800
like you don't have to be you don't

2136
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,199
think migration in terms of me from a to

2137
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,239
b if i'm stationary and a to b are

2138
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,959
passing by me

2139
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,679
like when the car beside me is pulling

2140
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,840
out of the parking lot i feel like i'm

2141
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,159
moving forward

2142
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,920
right that's also a migration

2143
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,679
so that is um

2144
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:00,840
related

2145
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,120
to what we talked about with some of the

2146
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,600
geometry like the projective geometry

2147
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,040
and how there's the flipping between the

2148
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,920
egocentric geometric projection

2149
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,199
where it's like your parry personal

2150
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,159
space and it's kind of like a

2151
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,000
distribution around you like there's me

2152
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,880
in the center or located somewhere

2153
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,199
and then there's like things closer to

2154
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,480
the eyes are generated to be

2155
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,000
bigger because they don't have to be

2156
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,960
because we know we're making the

2157
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,120
generative model anyway so why does it

2158
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,120
have why can't i see it from grand theft

2159
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,400
auto perspective

2160
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,040
it is a certain way for a certain reason

2161
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:33,920
so then

2162
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,800
that is flipping

2163
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,410
that's flipping with the um

2164
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:39,520
[Music]

2165
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,800
more like

2166
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,159
objective

2167
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,199
or d

2168
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,280
personalized stance like the prior on

2169
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,440
the architecture structurally of my room

2170
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,600
with a right angle and even if it looks

2171
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,520
different than a 90 degree angle in the

2172
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,679
generative model that's perceived as

2173
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,920
normal or unsurprising

2174
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,760
because it's compatible

2175
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,760
with the underlying structural

2176
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,159
hypothesis that's unobserved and then

2177
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,120
the observed structural observation that

2178
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,280
has to do with the actual way that the

2179
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,320
angles

2180
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,480
look

2181
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,199
so here's just one other um

2182
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:13,920
uh

2183
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,400
kind of professor gordon shout out slash

2184
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,040
angle to look into

2185
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,719
evolution of algorithms for collective

2186
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,000
behavior

2187
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,800
so

2188
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,800
let's connect this

2189
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,480
to the cognitive

2190
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,440
foraging and then dean's questions do

2191
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,280
you migrate do you use tools and do you

2192
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,400
provision

2193
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,840
so that's like

2194
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,360
related questions to that one might be

2195
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,800
like

2196
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,199
how how do you adapt when things change

2197
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,040
and you can't

2198
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,360
adjust certain things or

2199
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,960
um

2200
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,960
also the difference between like let's

2201
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,800
just say i'm using a software i'm not

2202
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
very familiar with like

2203
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,199
photoshop between doing one move

2204
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,440
photoshop searching on a search engine

2205
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,239
how do i paste okay paste okay i do one

2206
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,120
move so it's like a one step model of

2207
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,679
function versus someone who just rolls

2208
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,800
out of bed

2209
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,560
opens up photoshop and then they just

2210
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,719
open their mind to being creative and

2211
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,000
being in feedback with what they

2212
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,280
actually do

2213
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,960
and maybe that does involve still using

2214
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,800
a search engine but they're in a

2215
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,400
functional flow with respect to that

2216
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,360
tool

2217
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,360
and they've just set aside the time

2218
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,760
so that their regime of attention can be

2219
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,360
like productive or aligned with a

2220
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,080
project but they're not

2221
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,480
going step by step they're engaged in

2222
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,520
broader

2223
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,239
organization

2224
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,440
so we're talking about figuring out part

2225
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,960
rather than the finding out that's what

2226
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,960
you just described the difference

2227
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,199
between those two things

2228
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,320
yeah opening space for figuring out

2229
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,560
for figuring out

2230
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,240
and that's sort of like um

2231
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,600
[Music]

2232
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,640
it's a little bit like local and more

2233
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,199
miso or global foraging

2234
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,520
which is like you can dig in a given

2235
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,679
patch of dirt so it's super labor

2236
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,120
intensive

2237
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,760
but it's a local it finding of what is

2238
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,960
there

2239
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,320
versus

2240
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,400
trying to find a better patch of dirt

2241
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,400
and dig their first seed maybe even find

2242
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,840
an exposed seed

2243
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,320
but whether one of those policies is

2244
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,840
like has a higher risk of reward or

2245
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,760
energy expenditure that's going to

2246
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,920
depend a lot on what one believes about

2247
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,760
the frequency of like

2248
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,639
half emerged seeds and seeds in this

2249
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,960
location and the time cost of moving

2250
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,880
from location to location there's just a

2251
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
ton of features and it's not just like

2252
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,480
as simple as making a heat map of where

2253
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,040
the seeds are

2254
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:39,360
we

2255
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,520
would describe it as mimic foraging and

2256
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,040
and and

2257
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,120
mimic foraging and what was the other

2258
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,000
one

2259
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,280
modify

2260
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,840
foraging

2261
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,480
some people might oh blue go for it

2262
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,719
so it's interesting at the um conference

2263
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,639
i was at last week the you know they

2264
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,199
talked about like how far can you get

2265
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,639
mimicking an expert and there are

2266
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,719
several like talks like so you know

2267
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,159
whether it's

2268
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,400
navigating a maze or or you know

2269
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,639
figuring out whatever so like you know

2270
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,880
they'll train a model on a whole bunch

2271
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,840
of expert what would an expert do

2272
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,239
and then they set them loose in like a

2273
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,320
novel circumstance and if the novel

2274
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,840
circumstance is similar enough it kind

2275
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,040
of works but but really like the better

2276
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,040
thing to do is to put some exploratory

2277
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,280
component in there so you know you have

2278
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,199
like the expert training but but if

2279
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,520
there's an explorer component

2280
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,880
about that doesn't have to do with an

2281
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,400
expert or like you know if we train it

2282
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,639
to navigate its own maze also sometimes

2283
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,199
like alternating with its own maze or or

2284
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,080
you know

2285
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,719
amazed with experts in it so like

2286
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,400
following the experts only gets you so

2287
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,639
far and i wonder um

2288
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,320
and something that's come to really mean

2289
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,120
a lot to me in the field of intelligence

2290
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,360
is like when

2291
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,280
it's it's when there's innovation like

2292
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,040
when you can do something new when you

2293
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,360
can generalize and solve any maze

2294
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,199
because you learned from a few experts

2295
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,760
like that's innovative or you know like

2296
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,280
the ability to generalize but also the

2297
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,159
ability to innovate and produce some new

2298
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,760
output rather than just do what the

2299
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,639
experts do

2300
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,040
so

2301
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:15,840
one

2302
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,000
thought that's awesome comments blue

2303
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,120
like

2304
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,000
learning from examples and from experts

2305
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,320
usually learning by example when used

2306
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,400
not in a malicious way is referring to

2307
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,400
seeing somebody who is better or at

2308
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,800
least adequate if not

2309
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,560
far far better

2310
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,840
and then there's this question of like

2311
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,480
should it be shown only at the expert

2312
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,159
level

2313
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,520
because the

2314
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,719
expert speaker would do tongue twisters

2315
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:45,679
and

2316
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,080
russian sentences with five conjugations

2317
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,360
but the

2318
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,280
expert in interaction

2319
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,239
is able to approach a zone of agreement

2320
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,719
and of like proximal development

2321
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,600
so that the example and the expertise as

2322
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,120
applied

2323
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,679
is in a very specific space

2324
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,600
and that's like the order of examples

2325
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,520
and then knowledge like this person is

2326
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,120
able to conjugate this thing but they're

2327
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,280
having challenging conjugating this case

2328
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,560
so then

2329
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,639
depending on their personality maybe you

2330
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,080
lean more on the one that they are more

2331
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,159
familiar with or maybe they

2332
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,480
come to you to be wrong so

2333
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,679
there's a lot of

2334
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,280
advanced cognitive modeling and

2335
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,040
parameters that could be in a

2336
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,120
full-fledged model because that's a

2337
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,840
super complex scenario especially in a

2338
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,360
group and all of these you know

2339
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,840
relationships on

2340
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,360
relationships and

2341
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,960
we don't need to have that whole

2342
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,440
generative process model

2343
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,280
to have a generative

2344
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,040
model of policy

2345
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,280
that can be effective at foraging in

2346
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,360
that space

2347
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,199
so it is a project

2348
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:52,159
and

2349
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,360
making that map is helpful for it

2350
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,760
but to make policy decisions in the

2351
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,280
cognitive space

2352
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,120
isn't the same as describing and

2353
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,719
mastering all the variables of the

2354
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:05,199
cognitive process

2355
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,600
and so this mental foraging and physical

2356
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,360
foraging and also what we talked about

2357
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,400
with a sensory motor detachment

2358
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
helps make that really

2359
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,400
clear

2360
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,400
so like

2361
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,400
how does

2362
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,440
active inference model

2363
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,799
relevant expertise

2364
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,600
whether domain expertise or discipline

2365
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,480
like

2366
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,400
a set of affordances a versus a whole

2367
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,320
different set of affordances you know

2368
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,000
maybe

2369
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,719
or expertise like in that language

2370
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,800
learning example or some other example

2371
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,960
where it's not simply about like

2372
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,960
providing some

2373
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,639
advanced example

2374
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,159
and then having people asymptotes of

2375
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,199
that

2376
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,600
it's about opening the space for

2377
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,320
figuring out

2378
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,040
in that setting

2379
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,480
i think you can find a structural

2380
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,440
adaptation in mimicking an expert

2381
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,840
and and that that typically sort of

2382
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,400
plays itself out as instructionalism

2383
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,239
i think you can find yourself also

2384
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,000
modifying your niche and adapting in

2385
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,679
that way

2386
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,840
and then being able to go back and have

2387
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,040
an expert

2388
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,880
look at what you've done

2389
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,480
and the reason why they're an expert in

2390
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,920
that particular case isn't because

2391
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,679
you're going to mimic them

2392
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,400
but because you're going to ask them

2393
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,520
what they

2394
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,239
how the process that they use to arrive

2395
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,360
at where

2396
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,920
they have a certain subject

2397
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,080
confidence

2398
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,719
they are able to now diagnose

2399
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,520
where your where your confidences

2400
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,320
might

2401
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,400
exist and where you might

2402
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,639
want to

2403
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,960
might want to re-examine what the

2404
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,440
probabilities and preferences were that

2405
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,040
got you to the conclusions that you drew

2406
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,040
so

2407
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:07,920
again

2408
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,239
you're going to adapt either way

2409
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,560
but i think that the the path that you

2410
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,040
choose matters and knowing which path

2411
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,320
that you chose also matters so i adapted

2412
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,960
right i adapt because i i'm now trained

2413
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,880
up to be able to

2414
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,520
find the the blue dot the blue ball in

2415
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,239
the

2416
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:26,960
the

2417
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,679
the sea of plastic balls right

2418
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,800
that that's one form of of adapting

2419
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,840
because

2420
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,000
i've never been in a ball pit before and

2421
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,600
now i found the one that i was looking

2422
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,480
for

2423
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,000
but the other but another person could

2424
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,480
go in there and be able to

2425
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,159
maybe

2426
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,159
do something else with that blue ball

2427
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,719
because they modified the frame and the

2428
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,880
mesh and

2429
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,920
that's

2430
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,760
that again

2431
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,040
we just want to make sure that we know

2432
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,040
that there's a difference so that when

2433
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,520
we are reintegrating them at some point

2434
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,320
in the future we know how we got there

2435
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,639
that's all

2436
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,639
okay

2437
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,320
i like the

2438
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,520
throwback

2439
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,800
to instructionalism and interactionism

2440
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,960
it's an example it was like latently

2441
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,360
there when talking about that

2442
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,679
niche dependence and the co-creation so

2443
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,760
all these kind of terms

2444
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,000
digital sigmoidy when working online for

2445
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,560
example become implicit

2446
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,199
when we're using a given

2447
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,960
sequence to be talking about like a

2448
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,159
certain thing that we want to call our

2449
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,239
attention to we call our attention to

2450
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,159
some example

2451
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,159
or to some relationship

2452
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,639
and then that modifies our cognitive

2453
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:47,520
model

2454
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,199
so that we're thinking about things and

2455
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,120
doing things differently

2456
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,159
after

2457
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,000
and so it's kind of like quality of

2458
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,280
engagement

2459
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,520
rather than quantity

2460
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,040
because

2461
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,000
some people by

2462
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,360
reading a little

2463
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,159
change a lot and vice versa

2464
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,840
it's how you set up the relationship i

2465
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,120
think

2466
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,199
it's funny that you bring up um

2467
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,960
reading so like for a very long time um

2468
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,520
my my phd advisor like never read

2469
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,120
anything like she would never read

2470
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,639
anything did you oh yeah

2471
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:21,600
but like

2472
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,159
she just she does like speed reads she

2473
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,080
speed reads right which means like she

2474
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,120
looked at every third word

2475
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,480
and then like when she really sits down

2476
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,920
to read it she's got all these things to

2477
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,199
say about it and wants to like you know

2478
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,360
word smith every sentence and um it's

2479
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,800
great like we've had a lot of fun

2480
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,239
working together i don't i don't mean to

2481
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,480
like make that sound evil in any way but

2482
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,520
but i mean i i don't speed read i read

2483
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,400
fast but i i i'm totally incapable of

2484
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,560
speed reading because i feel like

2485
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,960
i have to duplicate my efforts like if i

2486
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,600
skim it like i can you know pick up some

2487
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,120
key you know headings or whatever but

2488
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,639
but i never really

2489
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,880
got to read it like like i want to read

2490
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,400
something i want to really read it like

2491
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,239
go through it line by line by line and

2492
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,360
look up things i don't know what they

2493
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,840
mean and this kind of thing so so it's a

2494
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,719
different

2495
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,800
um an interesting approach how different

2496
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,679
people approach things in different ways

2497
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,120
yeah

2498
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,639
yeah you know

2499
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,560
talking about

2500
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,040
in this paper

2501
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,880
how we've been going between the sort of

2502
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,760
physiological and biological

2503
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,840
substrate of cognition

2504
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,760
and the nervous system and the brain all

2505
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,520
of that and then this more

2506
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,080
cognitive modeling approach which can be

2507
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,960
sort of cut and dry or overly

2508
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,600
computational or so-called unrealistic

2509
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,560
with respect to biological foundations

2510
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,080
it's kind of like what dean pointed to

2511
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,320
with like the bifurcation and so now

2512
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,520
things are kind of

2513
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,320
coming together

2514
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,760
not in the way that everyone might have

2515
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,199
expected but at least in a way

2516
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,719
and so that's a very

2517
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:55,760
um

2518
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,520
interesting space and then like blue

2519
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,600
with a fast and slow reading

2520
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,840
it's almost like

2521
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
there are multi-scale dynamics

2522
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,639
associated with attention

2523
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,280
that can be measured with the eeg

2524
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,440
but it's a hidden state what is actually

2525
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,120
happening in the mind and brain but

2526
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,239
those are the kinds of experiments that

2527
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:16,560
people use and there's some rhythms like

2528
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,960
the fast cycles like gamma that are

2529
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,400
playing out at like kind of like the

2530
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,560
speed of perception

2531
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,199
and awareness of like words

2532
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,280
and then there's also slower like

2533
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,360
symbolic or semantic

2534
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,280
changes and all these different time

2535
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,480
scales and it's just like

2536
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,280
making the space to let

2537
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,760
the connections and the terms

2538
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,040
and the implications resonate

2539
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,520
and connect with the learner and the

2540
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,880
creator

2541
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,520
is like a lot more valuable than any

2542
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,360
amount of

2543
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,120
coefficient of low

2544
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,480
reading

2545
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,159
and so how to balance the information

2546
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,159
amount

2547
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,679
and type

2548
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,880
and sequence and all of these things

2549
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,840
with

2550
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,040
holding the space for just the slower

2551
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,159
transformative process

2552
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,920
and that's very related to

2553
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,000
yeah that's that's huge daniel because i

2554
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,679
think a lot of people that they get into

2555
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:18,639
the um

2556
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,400
instructionalism you'll hear the

2557
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,920
expression and i'm not i'm not over

2558
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,920
generalizing here you'll hear we'll

2559
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,560
we're going to break this down

2560
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,000
as opposed to the the interactionism

2561
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,080
which is we're going to slow this down

2562
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,760
there's a there's quite a difference

2563
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,040
those two things

2564
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,360
open up and slow down or

2565
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,719
we're going to

2566
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,600
drill down finish it out get it done in

2567
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,480
the time

2568
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,199
and

2569
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,199
as we discuss like

2570
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,679
this is the archetypes or the dialectic

2571
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,880
it's not like we're only taking one

2572
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,040
approach or another but it's very easy

2573
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,840
to see how the range in

2574
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
at least education space not even

2575
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,600
thinking of other areas

2576
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,719
is like

2577
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,239
it's the amount of content and then it

2578
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,320
projects down into

2579
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,920
how it's delivered

2580
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,840
and then content gets slotted in or out

2581
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,080
or things get expanded or not or the you

2582
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,679
know monday's class gets canceled and it

2583
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,360
moves to tuesday

2584
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,840
so that's like the sort of instruction

2585
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,120
projection

2586
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,320
approach

2587
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
which is so different

2588
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,159
in multiple ways

2589
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,239
especially in how it's applied to

2590
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,760
thinking more about the opening up of

2591
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,520
space and slowing down

2592
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,199
and the learner's journey and all that

2593
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,800
and when you're in the huddle in here

2594
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,600
and you're calling out the shorthand

2595
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,760
before you actually line up at the

2596
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,800
scrimmage line and snap the football

2597
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,719
it's interesting that what you pointed

2598
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,639
out blue i

2599
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:47,040
in my history i was always wait prepared

2600
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,120
to slow down when it was math and the

2601
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,480
symbology

2602
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,639
like i have no problem slowing down for

2603
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,719
that but trying to read out long

2604
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:55,760
sentences

2605
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,600
it just about kills me i mean

2606
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,239
my add i can't i have to interleave like

2607
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,360
every every 20 to 30 minutes because if

2608
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,639
i don't

2609
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,440
my skin starts to crawl so i mean those

2610
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,199
sort of contextual

2611
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,360
factors that are literally weighing on

2612
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,080
you

2613
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,760
you don't know those sorts of things and

2614
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,400
if you're an expert who's just trying to

2615
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,560
push out all this information in a

2616
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,320
13-week window

2617
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,920
i'm not really sure whether or not you

2618
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,320
can sort of get down to that level of

2619
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,560
personalization but if you're

2620
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,159
if you're able to

2621
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,679
it makes all the difference in the world

2622
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,560
in terms of what people take away from

2623
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,960
from the uh exposure right

2624
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,120
i find it way easier to do the shorthand

2625
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,360
thing i i you know if a picture's worth

2626
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,159
a thousand words

2627
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,560
i'm i'm in full agreement with that

2628
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,120
i just can't do the thousand word thing

2629
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,639
so

2630
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,040
yeah

2631
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,679
yeah really interesting and steven wrote

2632
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,600
in the chat good to see these questions

2633
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,600
about active modeling

2634
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,440
expertise

2635
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
being thought of in different ways like

2636
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,199
the direction of travel the distance to

2637
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,960
travel the rate of travel mode of

2638
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,520
transport

2639
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,360
yeah thanks for sharing it stephen um

2640
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,800
landscapes and sort of the sense making

2641
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,120
and the wayfinding

2642
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,800
and being on this

2643
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,760
cognitive landscape versus or and being

2644
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,320
on this spatial foraging landscape so

2645
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,960
going out for the mushroom forage

2646
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,159
with someone who's familiar with

2647
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:29,520
mushrooms and somebody else who's

2648
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,679
familiar with the biochemistry but

2649
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,520
hasn't seen the mushroom

2650
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,880
in the ground

2651
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,239
and then someone else who's on a

2652
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,080
different perspective because of their

2653
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,840
background or people with different

2654
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,080
physical abilities and knowledge in the

2655
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,520
spatial setting

2656
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,119
and then there's

2657
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,960
the cognitive foraging

2658
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,920
and then

2659
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,320
just like is it that the colony forages

2660
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,000
as a unit

2661
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,679
and then that's the sort of flip side of

2662
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,080
the nest mate's forage collectively

2663
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,920
and so the team

2664
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,639
forges as a unit collectively

2665
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,960
and the individual is sort of engaged at

2666
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,199
this level that we have

2667
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,639
experience at

2668
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,040
in the policy selection relevant to our

2669
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,119
participation in

2670
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,000
some

2671
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,990
either niche or team or project

2672
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:18,159
[Music]

2673
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,040
let's

2674
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,480
go back to the paper see if there's any

2675
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,000
other pieces like that we could kind of

2676
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,679
look at

2677
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,239
let's look at the roadmap

2678
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,119
introduction we talk a bit about the can

2679
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:36,800
we talk a bit about the endowment part

2680
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,960
of this

2681
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,800
we haven't really touched on that well

2682
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
just the endowment what's the endowment

2683
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
so in the point twos

2684
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,639
essentially that's

2685
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,960
now that we've built built this this

2686
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,000
base this stable platform

2687
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,440
what can we do with it like what

2688
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,719
leverage have we now potentially

2689
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,800
achieved so what's the endowment here in

2690
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,760
terms of

2691
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,159
what they what the paper really

2692
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,320
what's the new affordances that we

2693
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,159
didn't have before we them that we

2694
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,719
didn't maybe necessarily have

2695
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,880
explicated quite so clearly prior to

2696
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,400
reading the paper

2697
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,320
maybe that's one i don't want to

2698
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,239
put pressure on but

2699
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,400
what do you think blue

2700
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,159
so i'm trying to remember maybe you guys

2701
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,320
can remind me in this figure oh wait

2702
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,760
wait wait

2703
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,199
so endowing with with temporal depth um

2704
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,199
it's got to be an avo step right is that

2705
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,360
correct yeah

2706
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,159
yeah um because in having a homeostat

2707
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,840
with temporal depth like

2708
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,560
isn't possible right or or like isn't

2709
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,040
like they just can they can only do

2710
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,800
um

2711
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,480
and i wonder if that's like you know a

2712
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,719
single-celled organism can only like do

2713
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,159
at that moment like they're not planning

2714
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,320
for it to get cold later or something

2715
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,639
like that um

2716
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,199
and really the

2717
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:58,239
so i wonder if it's not only

2718
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,880
temporal depth but any kind of

2719
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,760
relationship like i wonder if it's not

2720
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,800
necessarily temporal depth if time is

2721
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,840
flat

2722
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,880
right

2723
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,560
i mean i guess in order to modify your

2724
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,000
own behavior or thought you would have

2725
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,840
to have some temporal depth

2726
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,040
but but this allostatic um

2727
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,480
idea is interesting with respect to

2728
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,040
um you know my relationship to

2729
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,440
my future self or my relationship to my

2730
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,760
previous self or my relationship to

2731
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,679
other people in my community or or

2732
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:30,639
whatever

2733
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,920
um

2734
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,800
so i just wonder

2735
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,119
about

2736
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,960
if if that's why this is the allostat

2737
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,520
and not the homeostat or like can you

2738
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,360
endow a homeostat with temporal depth

2739
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,400
and get that same kind of

2740
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,080
ability for perspective and

2741
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,920
retrospective inference like you can't

2742
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,920
but why not like maybe let's let's put

2743
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,600
some words to that

2744
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,719
let me see if i can find some in the

2745
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:55,760
paper

2746
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,000
nice point

2747
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,280
i would say

2748
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,199
homeostatic function

2749
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,679
could be in a model with memory or

2750
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,760
anticipation like the thermometer could

2751
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,840
record the last 100

2752
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,760
time points or it could have a

2753
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,840
prediction for the next 100

2754
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,239
but the function would be that it only

2755
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,760
turns on the heating once it gets too

2756
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,560
cold

2757
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,440
so it still is the um on the action

2758
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,040
selection side

2759
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:24,000
it still is making a one markov chain

2760
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,960
decision

2761
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,480
based upon an instantaneous

2762
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,800
measurement and so it can be implemented

2763
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,199
whether just for a computational

2764
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,520
parsimony or in a simple biological

2765
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,400
system with just one time step

2766
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,000
if it's this hot then turn on the

2767
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,280
cooling

2768
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,280
and um so it's the ultimate if then

2769
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,360
because it's like a threshold model

2770
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,400
and so

2771
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,000
it gets paired down over evolutionary

2772
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,639
time but then you're bringing up like to

2773
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,600
even engage with a counterfactual

2774
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,320
or some influence of something on future

2775
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,239
policy there has to be like a depth

2776
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,000
and then this gets back to whether it's

2777
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,440
modeling the thing itself like

2778
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,639
what

2779
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,719
do these represent are they

2780
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,840
the scientist testing a model of one two

2781
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,920
three or four five hour temporal depth

2782
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,320
for the ant forager

2783
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,520
or is this the foragers cognitive model

2784
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,360
as if that were somehow not model based

2785
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,800
science

2786
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,760
or is it the neuro architecture or the

2787
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,239
functional anatomy

2788
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,280
of the forager

2789
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,679
there's a lot of ways it could lean or

2790
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:36,770
be framed um

2791
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:38,880
[Music]

2792
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,679
i think in a complementary

2793
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,600
way but one will have to be really

2794
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,880
careful where support for one domain

2795
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,560
super valid and where is one not

2796
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,159
like if it were a circuit board with

2797
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,800
that topology then it seems like pretty

2798
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,159
good to go to use that as

2799
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,400
a pretty broad descriptor of a system

2800
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:03,520
whereas if this was a simplification of

2801
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,639
memory

2802
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,320
and there was an uncertainty parameter

2803
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,000
labeled

2804
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,800
uncertainty or anxiety like we discussed

2805
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,639
a little earlier someone slaps a

2806
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,360
parameter on one of these edges

2807
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,280
and starts addressing

2808
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,639
complex real world settings

2809
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,840
how does that exactly work

2810
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:28,800
so one of the things that i think that

2811
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,119
it endows us with is that

2812
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:34,159
the homostat homeostat is the sort of

2813
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,760
the basic the basic pattern

2814
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,600
there's a there's a partition between

2815
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,520
the epsilon and the mu

2816
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,960
so the first thing that they did is they

2817
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,320
created a sort of horizontal partition

2818
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,679
and then when they went to the

2819
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,199
parallelism now there's two epsilons and

2820
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,000
two muse and so now they added the

2821
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,679
vertical partition

2822
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:56,719
as well

2823
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,400
and i think that's really really helpful

2824
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,760
in terms of

2825
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,480
at the basic level of of the statistical

2826
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,920
we talked last time that you have to

2827
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,679
kind of be a polymath

2828
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,280
but i think from from a modeling

2829
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,000
perspective it's getting that orthogonal

2830
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,480
mesh established

2831
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,239
that moves us up the chain of complexity

2832
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:17,600
because then all of a sudden you can

2833
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,360
have diagonal dependencies

2834
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,480
and then you can actually add the the

2835
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,159
zed plane

2836
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,920
going through this in terms of how the

2837
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,320
scale is built out on both

2838
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,560
distance and time so i think that's one

2839
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,000
of the endowments that it provides

2840
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,360
i could just restate that it's like when

2841
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,600
we say that one of the advantages

2842
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,760
potentially in application of active

2843
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,600
inference could be that models are

2844
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,119
composable

2845
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,400
so

2846
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,960
they can be composed within

2847
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,280
a given scale like spatially or

2848
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
temporally

2849
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,320
and that has a visual

2850
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,840
representation

2851
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,920
it can also be composed in this nested

2852
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,840
way which as we've explored several

2853
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,719
times can represent physical enclosure

2854
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,639
or temporal enclosure as well as this

2855
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,040
cognitive architecture like mental

2856
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,080
action

2857
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,920
depending on how different variables are

2858
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,400
interpreted in nested modeling

2859
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,480
and so it's composable

2860
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,040
in several dimensions of transformation

2861
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,520
which they represented in figure four

2862
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,480
in a way where each transformative step

2863
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,000
even though the function might change a

2864
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,400
lot from the beginning to the end

2865
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,600
each

2866
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,280
organizational or structural

2867
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,760
architectural cognitive step or

2868
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,080
morphological if one is looking at that

2869
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,239
layer

2870
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,639
can be mapped into

2871
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,880
a certain space and

2872
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,480
direction of movement within that space

2873
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,239
do you think it can also be sculpted out

2874
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,520
i mean because we're looking at this

2875
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,679
historically we're looking at all the

2876
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,679
things that happened in the history was

2877
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,440
this the stuff that was kind of carved

2878
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,719
out

2879
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,480
and saw a lot of the stuff that doesn't

2880
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,159
matter removed

2881
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:01,360
in order for it to be more

2882
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,199
comprehensible

2883
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,400
because i agree with you it can be

2884
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,000
composed but i also think it's not

2885
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,920
decomposed but i do think or even

2886
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,480
deconstructed i think it can be sculpted

2887
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,879
out of a greater history a greater whole

2888
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,040
this

2889
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,639
oh yes please

2890
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:21,360
so sorry like what um

2891
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,119
you know when you talk about a greater

2892
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,119
history and we've talked about

2893
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,520
historicity in

2894
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,119
in today like during in the last two

2895
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:30,880
hours um

2896
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,960
and we've also talked about memory and

2897
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,960
there's a difference right like so so

2898
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,800
historicity is like

2899
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,000
historically accurate

2900
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,080
and memory is like what

2901
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,880
i remember or like what any

2902
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,440
what any individual um

2903
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,639
remembers

2904
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,080
yeah we've talked about that before

2905
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,719
actually i have a few live streams ago

2906
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,320
all i'm thinking is is that what this

2907
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,800
does is compare all the things that what

2908
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,400
what is it axel constant that said

2909
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,000
how did he frame it so that we can

2910
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,960
understand why we're here now versus the

2911
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,040
all the things that didn't make it

2912
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,840
right

2913
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,360
that's essentially what i'm talking

2914
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,080
about in terms of explaining

2915
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,400
right they're explaining why something

2916
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,239
got to the place that it did as opposed

2917
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:17,040
to

2918
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,280
the the necessity of all the things you

2919
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,480
had to do

2920
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,000
all the things you had to compose in

2921
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,920
order to realize

2922
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,000
the outcome i'm trying to

2923
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,159
bring that back to a sculpting metaphor

2924
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:29,440
now

2925
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,639
awesome so that's um the axle constant

2926
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,280
2021 paper the title was the free energy

2927
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,320
principle

2928
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,480
it's not about what it takes it's about

2929
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,000
what took you there

2930
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:40,960
and so

2931
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,480
that's definitely an evolutionary

2932
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,159
perspective and it's

2933
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,320
partially because of axel's background

2934
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,119
in evolution in ecology because

2935
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,360
that's what we can say about evolution

2936
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,760
this is what got birds here

2937
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,719
right

2938
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,440
and so the counter factuals in evolution

2939
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,040
are a really interesting topic and

2940
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,639
that's sort of um

2941
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:04,000
explored in a variety of like

2942
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,679
more popular as well as more

2943
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,840
mathematical treatments like how do we

2944
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,840
go from the observed

2945
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,320
which must have existed so it's very

2946
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,239
easy to fall to them being the best of

2947
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:17,119
all possible worlds optimal form etc

2948
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:18,800
but then we also recognize the changing

2949
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,320
environments and interactions and all

2950
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,440
that and then

2951
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,159
blue like with the histo historicity

2952
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,480
facts and the impacts which are like

2953
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,960
facts that aren't known

2954
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,639
and then there's the memory which

2955
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,600
requires a perspective

2956
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,960
people could use system memory or

2957
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,960
something to refer to to a fact or an

2958
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,360
impact on a system that but these are

2959
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,880
just being used loosely like some parts

2960
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,360
of how the past influences the present

2961
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,520
in the future have to do with systems

2962
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,440
that take a perspective

2963
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,760
other impacts are

2964
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,440
not through those

2965
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,080
adaptive active inference agents

2966
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,719
and so that's very different and so

2967
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,480
historicity is kind of like the

2968
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,119
stigmargy pheromone layer

2969
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,040
and then there's like memory with the

2970
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,040
forager so you could talk about the

2971
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,960
memory of the ground for the pheromone

2972
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,880
but it makes sense to just remember that

2973
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,239
it's a different thing with the

2974
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,920
pheromone on the ground

2975
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,480
than the cognitive infra ant

2976
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,560
and

2977
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,280
no nestmate is going to have all the

2978
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,600
knowledge or the onboard modeling to

2979
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,719
make

2980
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:28,560
decisions save for the ones that

2981
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,639
not to complicate it too much but it's

2982
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:32,320
stuck in the dialectic between doing

2983
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,400
exactly what worked in the past

2984
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,560
which is to say recently succeeded but

2985
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,320
might not work in the future

2986
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,920
and changing things but once you move

2987
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,440
into changing things

2988
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,600
the space of the adjacency of changing

2989
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,280
is sometimes like

2990
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,480
daunting and you still haven't really

2991
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,119
addressed the problem of changing world

2992
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,639
so

2993
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,400
forging is a very

2994
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,400
deep entry point like into a lot of

2995
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,679
these

2996
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,760
questions in active inference and in

2997
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,080
other areas because it really connects

2998
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,280
to the

2999
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,600
egocentric

3000
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,320
hopefully not in the um solipsistic or

3001
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,960
narcissistic sense but just in the

3002
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,920
way-finding sense-making

3003
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,000
paradigm

3004
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,800
that actually accommodates for

3005
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,159
others

3006
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,679
through modeling them explicitly and

3007
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:21,600
prioritizing the environment and things

3008
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,960
like that

3009
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,480
so

3010
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,840
pretty

3011
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,719
cool

3012
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:28,719
and this paper just to kind of

3013
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,800
restate what they

3014
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,960
brought to the picture

3015
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,119
they looked at evolutionary time scales

3016
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,280
and they framed cognition as

3017
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,119
structural change

3018
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,960
which in a bayesian modeling framework

3019
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,360
is sometimes called structural learning

3020
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,360
as opposed to like parameter learning

3021
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,400
fine tuning given the model structure

3022
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,360
and they connected that to the

3023
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:52,880
bayesian graph

3024
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,560
model of the active inference

3025
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,080
partitioning

3026
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,840
and then connected that to the factor

3027
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,040
graphs

3028
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,080
and then using the homeostat example

3029
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,440
talked about how there could be like

3030
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,119
elaborations

3031
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,400
into

3032
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,320
other structures so from structures to

3033
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,280
each other

3034
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,600
that might be enabling the rise of

3035
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,239
phenotypes or enabling the modeling of

3036
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:15,840
phenotypes

3037
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,239
that are interesting

3038
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,400
okay any

3039
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,320
final thoughts or like where does this

3040
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,719
paper take us

3041
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:28,400
what is different now what are we going

3042
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:32,759
to be talking about soon

3043
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,360
so i'm excited to um

3044
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,080
really delve into the math that is going

3045
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,600
to

3046
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,040
get behind

3047
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,360
the models that were elucidated out in

3048
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,840
figure

3049
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,560
4.

3050
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,800
how do we go through time and through

3051
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,920
relationality and

3052
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:57,199
hierarchical dimensions and so forth

3053
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,679
okay thank you blue dean you won't have

3054
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,800
the last word but what do you think

3055
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,400
well i'm still trying to figure out how

3056
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,000
this sort of ties in with the whole

3057
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,199
identity piece i i i left that because i

3058
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,800
thought that was just a rabbit hole that

3059
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,840
went way too far and too deep but i know

3060
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,000
that when you do get that parallelism

3061
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,280
and when you can sort of

3062
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,400
create

3063
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,320
a dimensional grid that has negative

3064
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,280
space as well so like you can be

3065
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,800
as units going positively or negatively

3066
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,719
and passing through zero and how that

3067
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,040
fits with identity that's that's sort of

3068
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,719
that's a kind of a personal thing that i

3069
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,480
got to do and then the other thing

3070
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,000
that i really but with the thing i

3071
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,920
really liked about this paper is that i

3072
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,440
think it took something that's really

3073
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,639
as you said over over huge time scales

3074
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,159
and sort of

3075
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,040
took it

3076
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,280
took it back down to something that

3077
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,000
that might be digestible for a lot of

3078
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,920
people that otherwise they kind of go

3079
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,599
okay so here's a hundred thousand years

3080
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:04,239
ago or a million years ago or whatever

3081
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,639
from the bacteria to now

3082
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:07,840
what what

3083
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,679
what are the sort of basic building

3084
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:10,800
blocks

3085
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,880
that we say might have

3086
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,000
might have

3087
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,760
played a part in

3088
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,560
getting to the kind of sophistication

3089
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,199
where we are now and again i think it's

3090
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,119
about learning i always think that

3091
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,199
evolution is about learning

3092
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:28,000
um and so

3093
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,400
as i said in the point one i this this

3094
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,040
affirmed a lot of the stuff that i think

3095
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,639
we need to be bringing into some of the

3096
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,400
more formal ways that we struck for

3097
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,639
learning because i think it is i think

3098
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,560
it's learning sort of

3099
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,960
unleashed as opposed to all tied up

3100
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,280
awesome

3101
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,080
thanks both and everybody who is uh

3102
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,320
helping in all the ways for the previous

3103
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,800
videos just some last thoughts would be

3104
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,840
like from both of you

3105
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
and hopefully all together

3106
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,000
there's really some interesting insights

3107
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,480
into learning and education for active

3108
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,719
inference learning which is kind of like

3109
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,360
our meta regime of attention in active

3110
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,960
inference lab

3111
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,800
when we're in that regime of attention

3112
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,000
but

3113
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,679
many people have other regimes of

3114
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,360
attention where

3115
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:20,560
it would certainly apply to

3116
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,040
bring some of these methods and ideas in

3117
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,880
and also bring

3118
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,159
pieces from

3119
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:28,000
outside into our

3120
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,040
cognitive modeling of attention and

3121
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,599
collaboration and communication like

3122
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:35,520
those topics and how those are the

3123
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,800
pillars of education and research

3124
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,800
during a time when

3125
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,520
education and research and participation

3126
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,040
are evolving

3127
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,199
is some of the most interesting things

3128
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,159
and so to be able to

3129
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:52,080
read evolutionary

3130
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,199
papers

3131
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:54,800
that take a cool

3132
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,280
scope and approach

3133
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,360
and then connect it to

3134
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,480
how we're hopefully organizing together

3135
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,840
and including the affordance to

3136
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,599
participate with anyone who's listening

3137
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,840
now

3138
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,400
it's an interesting mixture so i hope

3139
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,840
that we all

3140
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,520
can just keep on learning and applying

3141
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,480
together

3142
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,440
all right

3143
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,880
peace

3144
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,320
thanks guys thanks again bye
