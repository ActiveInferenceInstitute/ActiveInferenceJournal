00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:27,127
Alright. Hello and welcome everyone to

2
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,262
ActInf Lab Livestream number 38 Dot One.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,667
It's February 16,

4
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,397
2022. Welcome to ActInf

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,637
Lab. We are a participatory online lab

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,572
that is communicating, learning and

7
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,662
practicing applied active inference.

8
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:45,472
You can find us at the links on this

9
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,472
slide. This is a recorded and an

10
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,617
archived livestream, so please provide

11
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,347
us with feedback so that we can improve

12
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:54,652
our work. All backgrounds and

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,677
perspectives are welcome and we'll be

14
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:58,642
following video etiquette for live

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,977
stream. Just release an unending torrent

16
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,027
of emojis if you have to speak or just

17
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,602
raise your hand. I'm sure that will get

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,782
to it. If you're watching Live, please

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,197
feel free to write questions in the live

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,452
chat and we'll have enough time to hang

21
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:15,967
out and discuss during this dot one

22
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:19,025
where we'll be opening into the paper.

23
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,537
Check ActiveInference.org for

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,327
updated information on participating in

25
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:28,552
any of the labs activities. I hope

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,072
you'll find something that resonates

27
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:34,107
with you today in ActInf

28
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,802
Livestream number 38 Dot One. We're going to

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,012
be learning and discussing this cool

30
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,072
paper "The Evolution of Brain

31
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,697
Architectures for Predictive Coding and

32
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:48,007
Active Inference" by Pazulo, Parr, and 

33
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,677
Friston from December 2021.

34
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,652
And we're just going to enjoy

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,742
discussing it and opening up any idea or

36
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,817
questions that us here on the panel

37
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,527
have, or those who are live chatting us.

38
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:05,202
And we have some ideas and thoughts,

39
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:06,802
prepared a few things that we know that

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,097
we can go into. And also I hope that

41
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:12,297
everyone has brought some other prepared

42
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,075
seeds and also, of course,

43
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:17,572
spontaneously feeling like new

44
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,972
things are arising. So we'll just start

45
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,252
with some introduction and warmup. We

46
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,847
can each say hi and then maybe it'd be

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,997
cool to just also mention like, what got

48
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,947
you excited about the paper or what

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,227
image you want to discuss this paper,

50
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,927
what's something that stayed with you?

51
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:38,077
So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

52
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,767
California and I was very excited by the

53
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:45,712
evolutionary focus. A lot of my research

54
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,767
over the last years has been in

55
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,092
evolution and ecology, so it's always

56
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,387
awesome to see how people are thinking

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,562
about how active inference, free energy

58
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,052
principle and evolutionary studies can

59
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,047
all be learning from one another. And

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,812
I'll klaas. E. Stephan.

61
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:04,562
Hello, I'm Steven Silly. I'm in Toronto.

62
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,182
I'm really interested in how this paper

63
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:11,127
connects to my work with spatial meaning

64
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,632
making and social topographies because

65
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,812
this paper talks about more biological

66
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:22,522
nascent stage of development rather than

67
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:25,762
some higher order meaning that often

68
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:27,500
people think about. And I'm really

69
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,342
interested in how this sort of grounded

70
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,392
bottom up and active ecological

71
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,267
approaches can be thought about as

72
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,907
something where we can actually ground a

73
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,432
lot of our learning making. So I'm

74
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,752
inference in how this might match with

75
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,537
some of that thinking and I will pass

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,642
this over to Dean. Thanks,

77
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,132
Dean. I'm Dean, I'm in Calgary. What I

78
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:54,247
found interesting about the paper is

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,182
that given that I've worked with a lot

80
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,225
of young learners for a lot of my life.

81
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:04,357
It was really interesting to see how

82
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,627
this affirmed a lot of the thinking that

83
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,397
I was doing when I was trying to get

84
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,902
people past the idea that science is

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,977
only about the biology and the chemistry

86
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,652
and the physics that there is a

87
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,602
statistical and predictive component to

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,497
this. And those relationships in that

89
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,397
realm can build certain sense of

90
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,472
what the underlying architectures is.

91
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,727
So, as I said, a lot of this is

92
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:34,372
affirmations and it's kind of seen as

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,557
being not part of what it's typically

94
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:40,507
address core learning. But I think it

95
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,747
should be back to you, Dan. Cool.

96
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,597
Nice intro. Let's just start with a big

97
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:50,227
question and then either of you have any

98
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,302
reflections on the big question? Or

99
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,587
we'll go over to Blank Slide and just

100
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,767
bring up some questions we have. And

101
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,522
also it might be good to go over just

102
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,487
some of the key points in the paper,

103
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,317
like what did they actually do in terms

104
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,597
of their contribution? So the big

105
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,912
question, or at least one way to phrase

106
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,947
something that might bring someone to

107
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,452
approach this paper what is the

108
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,602
evolutionary neurophysiological basis of

109
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,487
cognition and how do complex cognitive

110
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,702
phenotypes arise? Like, you don't go

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,582
from zero to colony in one time step.

112
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,707
How does it happen that evolution arises

113
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:31,852
from precursor, sometimes simpler, but

114
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,812
also sometimes more complicated

115
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:37,852
precursors? Stephen mentioned what

116
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,937
is the basis for sense making? And

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,692
cognition and sense making are very

118
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,697
related. And what's been fun over these

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,937
last weeks and months is we've explore

120
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:53,922
basic or simple or reduced or basal

121
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,702
cognition from a variety of

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,102
perspectives. Like, we talked about the

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,387
bioelectric components of thinking

124
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,747
about basal cognition with Mike Levin.

125
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,297
Now we're thinking about a slightly

126
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,502
different approach to understanding

127
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,477
basal cognition niche we'll be

128
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,317
discussing here. And then also we've

129
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,912
looked at some of these more complex

130
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,287
cognitive phenotypes like mental action,

131
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,722
counterfactuals, deep temporal

132
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:26,442
inference, all the active logic

133
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,850
which we'll get into probably later.

134
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:33,592
How can we use generative models of

135
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,602
perception, cognition, action, and

136
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,812
impact like active inference to study

137
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,617
this whole continuum and diversity of

138
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,487
relatively simpler in our perspective

139
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,557
cognition, and also relatively more

140
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:50,722
complex cognitive phenotypes and

141
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,867
everything in between? So Klaas.

142
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,467
Stephan and then on with it. Thanks,

143
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:58,477
Daniel. Yeah, I mean, I suppose also

144
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,327
what some of the paradigm impacts of

145
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:05,225
that, of taking that all the way through

146
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,077
one question that might come up which

147
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,147
you may or may not have an answer to or

148
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,827
thoughts on. But Mike Levin's

149
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:17,752
work with the ecological cones at

150
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,197
the different nested levels and how this

151
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,092
sort of could be thinking about what

152
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,797
kind of action control

153
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,552
potential these different nested

154
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,127
levels might exist. I would be

155
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,525
interested to think about how this may

156
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,952
either be able to connect to that I can

157
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,452
see it connecting philosophically or

158
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,267
whether there's another bridge needed

159
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:45,502
between this modeling and that type of

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,525
modeling. Just something I mentioned.

161
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:52,550
Great.

162
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,632
Dean anything to add or perhaps I'm.

163
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,862
Going to wait till you get to figure

164
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,450
one. Okay,

165
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:06,922
so we won't go through all of

166
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:09,837
the Kilner points in the paper. That's

167
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,900
for the reading of the paper itself.

168
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,602
Nor will we even go over all of the

169
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,807
overview, which is what the dot zero

170
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:20,797
video 38.0 is for. So turn back time

171
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,252
and watch that one if you haven't, or

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,572
pause the video if you're not watching

173
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:27,532
it live. But what this paper does,

174
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:30,237
as evidenced by the Roadmap,

175
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:33,802
is introduce a few basic principles of

176
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,397
cognition, predictive regulation and

177
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,057
control and then also structure learning

178
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,442
in generative model models. That's not

179
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,977
how every neurophysiology text is going

180
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,302
to begin the building blocks of

181
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,952
cognition. It's not how every

182
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,727
evolutionary neurophysiology text is

183
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,227
going to be framing cognition, but

184
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:55,252
that's what they do here and that will

185
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,842
play into how it's similar and different

186
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,842
than other approaches. Then with those

187
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,667
building blocks in hand or on the floor,

188
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:06,177
they provide three examples of motifs

189
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:10,222
that ancestral brains may be

190
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,262
modeled as having or may have actually

191
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:15,997
had. With those three examples in

192
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,457
hand, it's then possible for them to

193
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,887
state a more general way of thinking

194
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,212
about the transitions amongst different

195
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,472
structures. These structures represent

196
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,777
brain design as structured learning and

197
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:31,252
generative models. That is called an

198
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,017
evolutionary algebra. And they introduce

199
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:38,152
five operators that can basically either

200
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,202
leave unchanged or change the

201
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,552
structure of brain design with respect

202
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:48,052
to generative Model models. And each of

203
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,807
those are explored in terms of what are

204
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,537
brain architectures changes that that

205
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,347
evolutionary transition is and

206
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,522
then what are the functional

207
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,032
consequences of that kind of an

208
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,557
evolutionary transition. Then they have

209
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,742
some discussions about how sequences or

210
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,497
patterns of application of this

211
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,822
evolutionary algebra could lead to

212
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:14,197
different evolutionary phenomena. So for

213
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,627
example, increasing temporal depth in

214
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,772
the future means that models are

215
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:21,102
increasingly prospective. Increasing

216
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:23,422
temporal depth in the past is like

217
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,977
memory, etc. And then they close with

218
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:29,872
mapping to a phylogenetic tree and

219
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,547
thinking about that evolutionary algebra

220
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,397
of state transitions being mapped onto

221
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,827
the bifurcating tree structure that's

222
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,922
called a phylogenetic tree which shows

223
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,962
the relatedness of different life forms.

224
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,367
That's the roadmap. Let's go to the long

225
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,472
awaited figure one and talk about

226
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,002
the action perception cycle and

227
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,017
predictive evolution. And so they're

228
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:57,397
gain discussing this in the context of

229
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,027
predictive regulation, anticipatory

230
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:03,547
regulation, cybernetics and control as

231
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,267
a basic design principle for the brain.

232
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:09,052
So Dean, what do you see here or what

233
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,775
would be cool to think about?

234
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,887
So one of this follows I think is the

235
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,000
usual pattern when we're trying to

236
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,077
explain where we're going to go. And so

237
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,907
you just had a roadmap up and I think a

238
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,222
roadmap is a way for the people who are

239
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,575
reading the Roadmap to find their way.

240
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,772
But I think what this diagram shows is

241
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,757
that in the middle of there, there's

242
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,077
something called a discrepancy. And that

243
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,702
discrepancy is later going to be given a

244
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:42,502
label y. And what

245
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,227
I think is really interesting here is

246
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,597
there's a flip potentially that can

247
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,447
happen here. That discrepancy is where

248
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,662
what I would describe as a rule factory

249
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,817
and rule in the sense that we find

250
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:58,522
patterns that's kind of our place where,

251
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,127
as it says, the prediction and the

252
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:03,352
observation come together. And I

253
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,257
belief that that's different than a

254
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,222
roadmap, which is find your way. I

255
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,917
believe that discrepancy or that road

256
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:12,277
factory is wayfinding. And I think what

257
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,822
we have the potential to do with this

258
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,822
paper because of the way that they have

259
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,897
sort of presented the information is the

260
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,572
words become eventually become

261
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:27,577
explicated rules, which then become

262
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,650
action in the phenomenological space.

263
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,277
That's where it gets really, really

264
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,807
interesting because I think most of the

265
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,277
time when people look at things as a

266
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,797
subject, they've taken the world and

267
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,252
they've collapsed down to words and

268
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,217
diagrams and models. What this

269
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,932
potentially allows us to do is flip that

270
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:47,617
and move from the words back out into

271
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,797
the space with a little bit more

272
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,957
confidence. So, yeah, that's why I

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,402
wanted to kind of start here because I

274
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,082
think the word discrepancy, it's the

275
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:59,617
first time I've seen it in this kind of

276
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,200
figure model and I really like it.

277
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,025
Cool. Yeah. It makes me think about

278
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,597
setting off on the road trip on the

279
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,842
mental actions that reflect the paper.

280
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,782
And there's the roadmap, which is super

281
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,417
informative, but it is like

282
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,582
instructionalism. It's saying you're

283
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:23,902
going to go two streets and then take a

284
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,942
left turn at the stop sign. And then

285
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,757
when this happens, then you'll do that.

286
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,232
And if you've seen this, then you've

287
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,077
gone too far. Kind of classic

288
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:33,962
instruction type sequences.

289
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,807
Here we have a figuring out because

290
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,197
it's visually arranged with some local

291
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,552
connectivity that's suggestive of a

292
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,477
causal connection through time. But by

293
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,967
no means is there only one way to read

294
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:52,792
this simultaneous figure. And so that

295
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,347
allows potentially for more of a

296
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,642
figuring out, including the figuring out

297
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,257
of rules. Yes, it is indeed a

298
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,447
little different with discrepancy at the

299
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,597
intersection here. Stephen. Yeah, so

300
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,527
this ties in with the lower bound

301
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:14,312
evidence control approach

302
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:18,667
of action. So the idea is that

303
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:22,302
action is what we can tractably

304
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:26,877
approximate and perception

305
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:30,412
is something that we can

306
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:33,697
access but can't, and we can try to make

307
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,522
more sense of, but it is a

308
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:42,127
harder piece of the equation to

309
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:45,652
get a handle on. So I'm wondering if

310
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,072
that's how do you feel about that

311
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,152
exploration in terms of its use across

312
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,227
other areas of applied active inference?

313
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,952
So I think it could make things a little

314
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,177
bit more digestible for a

315
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,537
number of concepts.

316
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,677
Okay. I'm thinking about this in the

317
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,452
context of recognizing that it's

318
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,297
different than other action perception

319
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,002
loops that we've seen, which is just

320
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,352
really important to keep in mind that

321
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,247
we're not perceiving something that

322
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,817
we're projecting too much because other

323
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,312
times the outgoing arrow from the entity

324
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:30,432
is. What if this were a Markov blanket

325
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:33,847
type diagram, which they often are, the

326
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,927
outgoing arrow would reflect active

327
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,922
states and then the statistical

328
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,317
dependencies that are outgoing. But

329
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,837
where is action? It's on the bottom

330
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,602
right. So let's really try

331
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,407
to understand why the pieces are placed

332
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,777
this way. The outgoing feature of the

333
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,287
cognitive entity is the prediction and

334
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,552
here's observation coming in. If this

335
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,147
were a Markov blanket diagram, we'd have

336
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,447
the world and then the incoming

337
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:06,022
statistical arrow would be the

338
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,947
observation, that would be the sensory

339
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:12,012
states. So here it's

340
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,397
the outgoing prediction of the entity

341
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,627
and the incoming sensory data or

342
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,700
observation. Those two are being

343
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:25,412
differentiate to form a discrepancy,

344
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:28,822
which is just a qualitative term, but it

345
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,117
could be then brought a little bit more

346
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:35,002
formally into a prediction errors or

347
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,477
a little bit even beyond that into like

348
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,987
a free energy differential. This

349
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,877
discrepancy has two arrows

350
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:48,062
coming out of it. From the discrepancy

351
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:52,072
is arising perception and

352
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:55,047
the changing of beliefs. Does perception

353
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,177
always involve changing beliefs? And

354
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,397
discrepancy is also giving rise to

355
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,022
action. So what kind of a thing is

356
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,947
discrepancy such that the inputs are

357
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,452
prediction and observation and the

358
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,712
outputs are perception and action?

359
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,327
So at the very least this is not the

360
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,232
Bayesian graph representations that

361
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:19,447
we've seen before or that we'll see in

362
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,292
just a few slides with a more

363
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,452
traditional interpretation of nodes as

364
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,402
random variables and edges as

365
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,682
statistical dependencies. This is a

366
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,937
little bit more like a thought map that

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,447
then connects to the variational free

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,197
energy equation which we talked about in

369
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:42,187
number 37 a lot more. But just to

370
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,312
recall, there's the red and the Bleu

371
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:48,202
lines, these two different components of

372
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,467
the variational free energy and those

373
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:53,572
are shown again here. So check out 37 to

374
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,632
learn more about the red and the Bleu

375
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,897
and about variational and expected free

376
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,372
energy. But for here we're starting with

377
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:07,187
this action prediction discrepancy motif

378
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,917
and then connecting it to perception and

379
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,062
action as variational free energy.

380
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,497
Minimization Stephen I think one

381
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,572
thing that's. Useful with this more

382
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,767
nascent representation is this

383
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,975
discrepancy can go into in different

384
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,527
directions. So it can be discrepancy in

385
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,012
terms of temporal occurrence,

386
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,627
when was the prediction predicted to

387
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:37,027
happen, when was it observed, but it

388
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,987
could also be what kind of prediction

389
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,412
and what kind of observation or

390
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,697
whereabouts was the prediction,

391
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,837
whereabouts was the observation as many

392
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,677
different and at different scales.

393
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:53,917
So there may be that at

394
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,597
the kind of lower levels. There's quite

395
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,912
a big jump between when I predict

396
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:03,127
the baseball encoding to my hand,

397
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,602
when that prediction was made, when that

398
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:09,817
observation occurs, and also

399
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,997
when that is chained up at

400
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,075
different slower, bigger steps of the

401
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,877
nested Markov blanket sort of sequence.

402
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:24,877
So this idea of discrepancy is I

403
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,427
suppose it's probably the biggest bucket

404
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,822
they could find, I would imagine at that

405
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,822
spot. And that may be partly why it's

406
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,147
there. Can I just add to Klaas.

407
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,452
E. Stephan think one of the things

408
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,267
that's interesting, especially after

409
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,847
just doing the 37 paper where we were

410
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,897
talking about guides, to me, the timing

411
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,772
of this was absolutely immaculate,

412
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,672
because now all of a sudden we've gone

413
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,875
from guiding to almost taking

414
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,927
potentially a referee's position on the

415
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,997
world, which is a whole different thing

416
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,952
than taking up the position of being a

417
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,452
guide. I mean, that's not nuanced,

418
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,847
that's not subtle. That's quite an

419
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,077
identity shift. And we're going to

420
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,432
actually get into identity when we look

421
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:09,367
at some of the evolutionary steps later

422
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,947
on. But I wanted to slow down on this

423
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,567
because I thought that's not a minor

424
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,692
change, that's a whole different

425
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,552
perspective shift. And I think we need

426
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,857
to really make note of that because I

427
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,122
think it colors a lot of what's to

428
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,647
follow. What makes

429
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,047
you say that we're a referee in this

430
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,487
situation? Discrepancy.

431
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,402
There's a difference between what the

432
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,122
world is telling us and then how we rule

433
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,952
on that. So think of any game where you

434
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,825
get into an argument with the rest.

435
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:46,177
Are they wrong, are you wrong? It

436
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,752
doesn't really matter. The point is that

437
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,777
there's a difference that's when you

438
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,757
said differential graph is maybe one of

439
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,272
the ways to be able to make that

440
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:55,947
explicit, but that's not how it's

441
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:59,577
typically framed out when we're

442
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,842
talking about Bayesian or Markovian

443
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:05,662
stuff. So I think this is a big move.

444
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,047
I know it might seem like a tiny one,

445
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:10,042
but I think as we go again, as we go

446
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,322
deeper into this paper, it affirms a lot

447
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,277
of the stuff that I actually saw when

448
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:18,432
you're trying to go out there and forage

449
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:21,922
and figure. So I'm excited to keep

450
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,902
going. Yeah, it could be like the

451
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,317
observation. The baseball player is

452
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:29,277
running towards the base and the coach

453
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:31,437
is observing and there's this ongoing

454
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:33,892
prediction and observation with no

455
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,407
discrepancy because part of the

456
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,042
generative model includes the person

457
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,522
moving through time. And then given

458
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,697
the observation and the generative model

459
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,672
the coach predicts, slash, expects and

460
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,072
prefers, which we'll come to again later

461
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:51,627
with the three piece that the baseball

462
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:55,057
player is safe. You rarely see super

463
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,892
animated refusals when a call has gone

464
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,872
towards somebody, but it's when it has

465
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,402
gone against, it's violated their

466
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,297
fitness that there's a discrepancy with

467
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,667
what the referee has called and what the

468
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,922
interested coach has called. And that

469
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,837
is going to lead to some consequences.

470
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:14,677
And again, we're still not at the

471
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:16,957
Bayesian graph level, but that's going

472
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,037
to be the next figure. Steven.

473
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:25,117
This can then Bull on

474
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:28,027
the idea of what's cognitive, what can

475
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,482
you have a perspective on? I think what

476
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,047
you're saying there with this referee

477
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,802
position is as well as the kind of

478
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,142
swarming dynamics and the kind of

479
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,872
inactive processes, much of which is

480
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:42,592
beyond our ability to sense or

481
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,727
integrate. What is it once it starts to

482
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:47,602
hit? What's the big bucket at the kind

483
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,022
of cognition level that still isn't too

484
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:55,047
much of an inflation.

485
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:57,852
So in this case here, discrepancy.

486
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:00,142
There is a sense of being able to

487
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,302
distinguish perception and action at

488
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,752
some level and find a discrepancy,

489
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:08,347
which in some ways I

490
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,372
would imagine covers a lot of what

491
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,177
cognition would require to be thought of

492
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:15,772
in a cognition way. Other types of

493
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:19,192
action, for instance, how we heal or

494
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,807
grow, maybe action and

495
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,622
perception won't be so separated. But

496
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,572
this is trying to come at the idea of

497
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,697
cognition. So maybe that also informs

498
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:33,412
this process. Cool. So action two,

499
00:23:33,475 --> 00:23:36,567
again, was just about the two concepts

500
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,502
of predictive regulation and control.

501
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,347
That's what we saw here, predictive and

502
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,027
control. So it's just conceptually laid

503
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,600
out in figure two.

504
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,387
They formalize brain design as structure

505
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:57,522
learning in generative models.

506
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:00,575
So here we have a difference figure.

507
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:05,375
We still have the

508
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,847
cognitive entity and the world. We add

509
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,812
in one layer of absolutely essential

510
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:16,467
active terms, which is generative

511
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:19,327
models, generative process. The

512
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,342
generative model is the cognitive

513
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:24,847
entity's model of the

514
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,567
generative process is the underlying

515
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:29,347
phenomena that gives rise to

516
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,242
observations. It's the difference

517
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,302
between the cognitive model of vision,

518
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,877
a generative model of vision, and the

519
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:39,297
generative process of visual input,

520
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:42,022
which is like photons and the sun and

521
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:45,112
all of that. So these are very

522
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,572
different. They're complementary. But

523
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:49,342
just so that we're really clear going

524
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,542
forward that we're going to be using

525
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,347
those in their specific sense, not using

526
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,522
them like, oh well, it's a generative

527
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,262
model because this is a model of

528
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,002
cognition that makes me excited and

529
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,972
think of ideas, that's not how we're

530
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,352
using generative models here. So just to

531
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,027
be clear on that, now we see

532
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:10,047
action as changing the world represented

533
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,032
by you. And the cognition involves

534
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,227
partially action selection,

535
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,887
policy selection, planning as inference,

536
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:23,000
but not going to all those details yet,

537
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:26,992
which can have some influence on actual

538
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,987
unobserved, hidden states of the world.

539
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,267
X star. X is the cognition

540
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:36,832
model of that hidden state of the world

541
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,812
that is being inferred.

542
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:43,452
And Y is the observation that then feeds

543
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:45,275
back into the cognitive model.

544
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,400
So that's what these nodes mean.

545
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:53,262
It's about partitioning the cognitive

546
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:56,827
model from the generative process,

547
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,777
separating the generative models from

548
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,702
the generative process. And we're

549
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:04,137
starting to see the traditional blanket

550
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:07,047
form with observations having incoming

551
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:10,002
statistical dependencies and actions

552
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,907
having outgoing statistical

553
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:15,322
dependencies. What else do either of you

554
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:16,700
see in this model?

555
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,037
Yahtin.

556
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:24,852
So let's go back to being a referee

557
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:27,382
for a second. The assumptions is that

558
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,202
you're already attending. And most of

559
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,342
these models that we have taken up

560
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,925
in the past, especially in 37,

561
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,242
what they try to focus on is getting

562
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,007
from A to B. What this is essentially

563
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:47,197
saying is let's add something to that

564
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,662
translation right from A to B. Whatever

565
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,297
we're trying to incorporate in this

566
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,502
representation, let's maybe look at the

567
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,752
interpretation part of it now and the

568
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,327
recitation part of it. So if I'm the

569
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,982
umpire and we can all be umpires. We

570
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,697
don't have to do that just in a baseball

571
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,272
game. This is incorporating now a

572
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:08,572
certain critical process. I was

573
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:11,257
attention and I saw this, but then there

574
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,942
were 600 other people also paying

575
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,577
attention and they saw that. That's

576
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,642
where I think this is getting really

577
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,637
interesting. Now this is actually

578
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,797
bringing it back to sort of I still

579
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,527
think it's an instrumental piece, but I

580
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,122
think now we're going to incorporate

581
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,882
some of the reality. Were the 600 wrong

582
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:35,312
or is the one person who yelled out safe

583
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,262
wrong? That's what I see in this

584
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,717
because that you is definitely embedded

585
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:46,402
in the generative process, not the

586
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,362
generative models.

587
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:51,887
Okay. Thanks, Dean Steven.

588
00:27:55,537 --> 00:27:58,837
So the question that comes into

589
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,467
mind is where the body is

590
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,575
in all of this. And I sense that

591
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:10,187
the generative process is the bigger

592
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,392
process with the world. The generative

593
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:17,062
model gives away

594
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:20,622
to access those prior

595
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:24,022
and to give away the hidden states.

596
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:27,867
And the cognitive model, generally

597
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:29,917
speaking, cognition is thought of more

598
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,312
in terms of deductive and inductive

599
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:35,752
reasoning and logic. And it

600
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,322
could be that there's elements of

601
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,992
the abductive that could be held within

602
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,232
the kind of body. And I suppose there's

603
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:47,962
a question there as to how

604
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:49,417
and where that is. I don't think anyone

605
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:51,275
quite knows the answer to that, but

606
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:56,652
that's my thought. So let's

607
00:28:56,832 --> 00:29:00,667
remember that this partitioning is

608
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,907
specific to a given instantiation of

609
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,267
model based science, just like Majid was

610
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:10,117
talking about. So we're not going around

611
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,427
and assigning aspects or phenomena of

612
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:14,392
the world into either a generative model

613
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,207
or generative process. So where does the

614
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,102
body fit in? Well, with respect to a

615
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,287
model of the body being a structurally

616
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,727
real thing that gives rise to

617
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,050
observations, it's a generative process

618
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:29,872
looking at the coin from the other side

619
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,892
and thinking of the body as a generative

620
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:36,517
model of its niche, doing inference on

621
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,992
certain things or acting as if in that

622
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,850
sense it's generative models. So

623
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,147
different kinds of entities are not

624
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,367
going to be just assigned simply to one

625
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,572
side or the other. It's going to come

626
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,717
down to what is specifically being

627
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:53,242
discussed. There's a few

628
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,692
other not complexifiers, but first off,

629
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,632
just note that the notation here is not

630
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,602
the same that's used elsewhere. So we

631
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,767
will move towards better and cleaner or

632
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:08,300
reformattable notation. But like X star

633
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:11,077
as an external state and X as an

634
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:14,197
internal state might be clearer for some

635
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,152
people. It also carries a little bit of

636
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,492
a baggage that the hidden states is

637
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,147
exactly what is being inferred about the

638
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,082
entorhinal world. Like there's a

639
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,882
temperature parameter in the brain and

640
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:27,117
then there's a temperature parameter

641
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:30,382
outside in the world as we explore in

642
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:32,847
the representations paper. It doesn't

643
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:34,627
necessarily have to be that way. There

644
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:37,557
could be a hidden states internally

645
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:39,652
having to do with movements left to or

646
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,442
right and then there's a temperature

647
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,602
variable outside and then the model,

648
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,347
the generative model of the Cognizer is

649
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,192
about movement conditioned on

650
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,442
temperature observations, but not

651
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,777
necessarily simply a thermometer

652
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:59,052
being instantiated in the head. So it's

653
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:01,332
like good to look at this graphically

654
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:04,302
and think about what is being connected

655
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:07,597
to what without worrying too much

656
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,942
about all of these side questions. But

657
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:12,802
this is what they're setting up as the

658
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,772
basis of their further dimension, which

659
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:19,852
is it's about prediction and control and

660
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,542
we can use Bayesian graphical approaches

661
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:24,587
to represent that. Steven.

662
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,777
And that influence state, as you

663
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,342
mentioned, in some ways that's always

664
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,997
slightly hidden from us. What does that

665
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,667
Dean to be an inferred state in terms

666
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:39,787
of? Is that the cognition that's coming

667
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,372
out of that in some sort of deductive or

668
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:47,092
can it be an effective sense of how well

669
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,075
something is going? So again, it's not

670
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:55,572
directly asked here, but accessing

671
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:56,947
that is one of the big problems that

672
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,247
happens. How do you access what has been

673
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,942
inferred when it's not necessarily

674
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,097
something you can access through sort of

675
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,275
direct reporting from a subject matter,

676
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:13,237
from a participant? Right? Like another

677
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,097
example of that might be somebody who

678
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,467
has skilled action with respect to

679
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:20,887
investing, but they may not be able to

680
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,127
give an estimate for a number that's a

681
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:27,352
certain asset is expected to be at

682
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,897
because it's not like they're doing the

683
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,327
asset price prediction and then doing a

684
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:33,757
strategy. The cognition model may have a

685
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,182
very different structure, so we explored

686
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:38,617
it in the representation in this paper.

687
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,552
But like there would be ways in which

688
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:43,267
therefore that investment decision is

689
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:46,722
not a representation of the actual stock

690
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,342
market because it's not the same

691
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,477
variable. But then the aboutness of the

692
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:55,027
investment decision would be a

693
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:57,622
representation with respect to what was

694
00:32:57,655 --> 00:32:59,407
happening in the generative process. So

695
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,032
those were some of the side avenues that

696
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:03,402
we've looked at previously, but they're

697
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:06,022
all in play at once. And so the question

698
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:09,097
is just how to linearly structure to

699
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,692
respect the specific contributions that

700
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,122
are made here and the insight that can

701
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:18,425
be gleaned without every single time

702
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,662
pulling back to some of these questions.

703
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:21,937
But it's great that we have like

704
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,087
specific papers and memes and core terms

705
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,297
that we can refer to and

706
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,532
then carry on with what they actually

707
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,552
contribute. Okay, any thoughts on

708
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,875
one or two before we get into the

709
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:42,512
structure of the Alo stat

710
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,900
or the homeostat first, I guess.

711
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:50,497
Let's go. Okay, so we're going to go

712
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,022
from this black and white Dorothy still

713
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:58,222
in Kansas mode to

714
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,692
some predictive motifs of ancestral

715
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:05,542
brains. And the three motifs, the red,

716
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:09,887
green and Bleu are homeostasis.

717
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:13,262
So returning to a set point, allostasis

718
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:16,252
anticipating or approaching a set point

719
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,277
in the future, which could be a fixed or

720
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:20,967
changing one and then implementing

721
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:25,212
behavior control, not just scalar

722
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:27,157
homeostasis or allostasis on an

723
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,487
interceptive variable.

724
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:33,352
Okay, citation 20 in

725
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,187
the paper chance at all from the future.

726
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,832
March 22 is where to look for

727
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,657
more details on the homeostatic

728
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,547
formulation that they're using here but

729
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,662
we can see it in terms of their figure

730
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:50,752
free. Okay, so the left side just for

731
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,137
reference there's figure two so that we

732
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,267
can remember the structure of

733
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,477
perception, cognition, action, impact

734
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:59,647
that the authors are working with here.

735
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,747
And we're going to connect this black

736
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,287
and white figure two to figure three

737
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,525
A. This is a graphical model,

738
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:11,922
graphical in both senses, meaning

739
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,542
visual, like we're perceiving it through

740
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,562
computer graphics and graphical meaning

741
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,352
like a network so nodes and edges

742
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:22,297
because there's computer graph that

743
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,522
aren't network topologies. But this

744
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:27,427
happens to be a computer graphic that

745
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:30,592
we're perceiving visually that also is

746
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,922
reflecting a graph in terms of nodes and

747
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:36,492
connected edges. It's a generative

748
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:40,252
models for the regulation of

749
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,397
a single interceptive variable. So

750
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,947
here's A and B with the homeostat and C

751
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,902
we split out to talk about later. But

752
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,612
first A and B. This generative models

753
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:55,187
includes an interoceptive thermoreceptor

754
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:01,862
and a belief about body temperature.

755
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,617
The prior over X, which is body

756
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,302
temperature, is kept fixed and hence it

757
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,167
acts as a cybernetic set point. Any

758
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:13,182
discrepancy between the predictive,

759
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:15,432
thermoreceptor activity given beliefs

760
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:18,802
about X. So Y conditioned on X and the

761
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,817
measured y is registered as a prediction

762
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:22,822
error that is canceled out by an

763
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:25,477
autonomic response. U, for example, a

764
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:28,422
thermoregulatory response. So hidden

765
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,072
states on temperature, beliefs about

766
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,262
temperature, why the thermometer

767
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:37,927
perception and then there's the

768
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,882
selection of action. So some sort of

769
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:43,317
like vasodilation or thermoregulatory

770
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:45,742
response and then that's going to change

771
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,502
the underlying unobserved true

772
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:52,327
temperature but that's not needing to be

773
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,262
shown. So any comments on that first

774
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,062
part? We're looking just at the top half

775
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,912
of three A and connecting XY

776
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,962
to you. Action.

777
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:08,000
Can you still hear me? Yes.

778
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:11,467
Can you take the cursor now and just

779
00:37:11,515 --> 00:37:14,622
reinforce the feedback and the feed

780
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,152
forward part of this because the author

781
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:18,187
spent a bit I don't want it sort of

782
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:20,767
unpacked like they have at the figure

783
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,102
three unpacking that we have at the

784
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,572
bottom of the slide. Can you just run

785
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,912
the cursor over all the examples of

786
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:28,597
feedback and feed forward going on

787
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,527
concurrently? Because I think that's

788
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,032
really important to see that it's

789
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,575
happening in both directions at once.

790
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:40,567
Let's label everything and then

791
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:43,972
definitely can do that. Perfect. Thank

792
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:44,600
you.

793
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:59,757
Okay, so light Bleu is

794
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:03,447
action. These are

795
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,212
subtracted. So red circles represent

796
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:11,862
expected values of

797
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:18,147
X. The red circles which

798
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,200
are used to make predictions about Y,

799
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:24,657
these are subtracted to form a

800
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,837
prediction error.

801
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,720
Because those lines with the arrows on

802
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:34,330
the end of them are just dependencies.

803
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,805
They don't really show both the feedback

804
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,162
and the feed forward.

805
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:56,275
Yes, agreed. Like having some rounded

806
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,515
edges and other directed

807
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:03,705
edges. Let's see whether it's whether

808
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:05,637
they're like kind or not.

809
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:14,125
Let's start with action. Action

810
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:19,062
influences the state of the world which

811
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,930
an edge can be drawn to, how that

812
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:26,810
changes the state of. The thermo

813
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:30,240
receptor. Why? Here was the

814
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:33,495
observation. Yeah. That's the state of

815
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,120
the thermoreceptor is the observation.

816
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,740
Okay. Yeah. So action changes this the

817
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:39,215
observation, the state of the thermo

818
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:42,480
receptor which

819
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:45,855
is being contrasted with

820
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:49,335
the belief about temperature. From

821
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,795
there, a prediction error is generated.

822
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,755
It could be zero if there's no

823
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,912
difference, or it could be higher.

824
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:04,910
Can you just show, with some colored

825
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:08,610
line that has an arrow on each end a

826
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:11,235
connection that demonstrates within that

827
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,760
diagram the feedback and the feed

828
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:16,935
forward at once? Is that possible

829
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,615
using this diagram? Let's see it's

830
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,790
representation. So a single arrow, a

831
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:25,485
single line that has an Aaron Fath.

832
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:27,560
Both ends is a different color. So we've

833
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,985
superimposed it over this, but that it

834
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,210
shows that there's a feedback feed

835
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:35,412
forward loop going off at the same time.

836
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,115
Okay. So here's the temperature

837
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,260
information measurement flowing in to

838
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,905
contrast with the beliefs. And it is

839
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:48,605
in general, really important to label

840
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:51,100
the edges, not just use color coding.

841
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,565
We'll let it roll for now. The

842
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:55,065
information is flowing from the

843
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:59,037
measurements to the belief and then that

844
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,800
gives us the prediction error.

845
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,112
Then the prediction error is used

846
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,750
in the selection of action,

847
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:14,745
which then influences future

848
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:15,775
observations.

849
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,110
Now the red circles represent expected

850
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,362
values of x.

851
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,265
I'm actually not sure what exactly the

852
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:33,025
red bottom, larger circle is meaning.

853
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,240
Because the prediction error well,

854
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:40,365
there has. To be some way of

855
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:42,462
representing that discrepancy. Right?

856
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:46,740
So they needed the second ball on

857
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,845
the bottom to show difference between

858
00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:51,690
prediction errors and expectation. I

859
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,562
think that's all that's trying to show.

860
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:58,140
Yeah. Or another possibility might be

861
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:01,160
that the prior is staying field.

862
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,112
Correct.

863
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,960
They can be flexible, but in this case

864
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:12,740
it's a fixed prior. That's because we're

865
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,610
talking about homeostasis. Then the

866
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:21,660
observations are diverging from the

867
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:25,785
prior and the posterior is

868
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:28,525
kind of like the realized perception,

869
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:31,365
which is a compromise between the

870
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,475
sensory data coming in and the prior.

871
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,270
And so, yes, there's a lot of degrees of

872
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,995
freedom depending on how parameters are

873
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:39,585
weighted. This green line might

874
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:41,735
approximate the red a lot more sharply.

875
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:44,505
We call that a weaker prior because

876
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:47,085
sensory data updates the posterior to be

877
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:50,340
more like it. Or it

878
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,830
could be the case that having a lot of

879
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,710
observations different from your prior

880
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,420
don't change it. That's a strong prior

881
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,160
where sensory data do not change it as

882
00:42:59,192 --> 00:43:02,825
much. But then here is the prediction

883
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,870
error in relationship

884
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:10,215
to x. I don't know. We can look at the

885
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:14,435
paper, but is Mu shown

886
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,715
in an equation? I don't have it copied

887
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:19,005
out if it is. Let me look here while

888
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:22,260
you're doing that. Yeah, but that is the

889
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:23,937
perhaps here. Okay.

890
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:26,637
Steven, anything?

891
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:33,650
Yeah, I'm just noticing how effective

892
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,575
the belief on temperature.

893
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,600
It flows through the thermoset

894
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,735
down into the to get the expectation

895
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,362
prediction error. So,

896
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,040
like you've shown there, there is a

897
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:56,435
dynamic going down from the belief

898
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,685
through to prediction error being

899
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:01,515
mediated. It's like the thermoceptor is

900
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,740
kind of like a mediator between belief

901
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,515
and prediction error on

902
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:09,025
what to do for action.

903
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,485
And another point, the reason why you

904
00:44:19,517 --> 00:44:21,405
can't find the mu is because it's not

905
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:25,450
actually pointed to in the description.

906
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,990
It's not really true. Yeah, and I

907
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:29,730
remember reading and looking and looking

908
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:31,905
and looking and not being able to find

909
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:36,030
it and then looping back up paper to go,

910
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:39,080
okay, so how about feedback feed

911
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,025
forward. Now, there are cases

912
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,515
where view is used to describe internal

913
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:49,380
states that

914
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:51,315
may be implicitly how it's being used,

915
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:53,700
but it's super important that all

916
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:56,195
variables are defined in a paper. I wish

917
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,440
they all had a table for every single

918
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,765
variable and expression that were used.

919
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:02,660
Yeah, it would make the dot zeros

920
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,190
easier, but also it would reduce

921
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,200
uncertainty.

922
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:10,890
For example, is this epsilon even

923
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:13,395
described? Okay. Steven. I mean, I

924
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:16,380
suppose in a thermostat in some ways the

925
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:20,105
internal states of the bioelectric

926
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:24,930
strip in some ways it

927
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:28,485
holds the way

928
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,165
that the expectation of action

929
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:33,960
can happen because in some ways it

930
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:37,440
dictates the way that the

931
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:40,965
thermostat will behave in some sort of

932
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:45,100
ways, even if it's kind of an analog

933
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:50,205
process where

934
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:53,040
would the kind of Kilner thermostat I

935
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:54,960
know this is a homeostat, so it's a bit

936
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:56,805
more sophisticated now. But

937
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,890
extrapolating that out, you've kind of

938
00:45:58,907 --> 00:46:02,885
got a belief, and there's a belief

939
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,370
of what something is, and then there's

940
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:06,825
an expectation of what you can do about

941
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:09,765
it. For instance, my beliefs can go

942
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:12,175
bigger than what I can do in my actions.

943
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,650
I could have beliefs about temperature

944
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:19,095
which exceeds where I can even exist or

945
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:21,995
where I am able to change it. It depends

946
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,710
on the scenario. So it's held in

947
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:29,760
both scenarios in both the body and

948
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:31,962
the context and the kind of

949
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,835
probabilities available. Okay, so for

950
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:39,100
a nonliving thermostat,

951
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,865
it doesn't have a cognitive belief on

952
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,110
temperature, but there could be

953
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:44,535
something that's computationally like

954
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:47,015
that reflected by just a digital prior

955
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,655
on temperature. And again, these aren't

956
00:46:49,715 --> 00:46:52,145
cognitive, personal, effective,

957
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:55,205
experienced beliefs. Bayesian belief.

958
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,455
This is just saying random variable

959
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,360
reflecting in a model variable on

960
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:04,130
temperature. So even a sincerely held

961
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,965
incorrect ecological belief is not the

962
00:47:07,982 --> 00:47:10,230
Bayesian belief. They might coincide at

963
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:15,975
times if it were a parameter, but the

964
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:20,310
belief here being the

965
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:21,025
prior,

966
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,990
it must be adaptive. That's the

967
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:28,515
evolutionary twist that actually helps

968
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,375
resolve a lot of this because otherwise

969
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,755
the design space of all edges by all

970
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:35,110
nodes and then any variable I mean,

971
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:37,240
it's just like saying here's all the

972
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,605
words in the dictionary. And so

973
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:41,370
evolution helps restrict the discussion

974
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:44,590
to cases that actually do manage to

975
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:47,515
achieve adaptive control. Dean this is

976
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,940
where the translation from the

977
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:51,780
silhouette of a head to a statistical

978
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,365
density is assumed that the person who's

979
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:56,985
following along with this just sees

980
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,740
that. But you can also see how easy it

981
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,737
is to slip into the idea that,

982
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,840
oh, wait, a second, we've gone from the

983
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:07,495
physical space and we just held on to

984
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:09,040
the physical space, when really now

985
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:10,455
we're talking about a statistical

986
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:13,845
density space. And again, if you're

987
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,940
not really, really careful, you can see

988
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:18,025
how people can carry forward something.

989
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,935
But the actual thing that they're

990
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,615
talking about has changed. That's why

991
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,535
the word discrepancy was such a big deal

992
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,680
to me, because I normally gloss over

993
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:29,335
things, but this time it actually I

994
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:30,715
went, oh, okay. So there's going to be

995
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:32,340
some there's going to be some moments

996
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,985
here where we're actually talking about

997
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:35,665
different things, even though in the

998
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:38,865
continuum we kind of think that they're

999
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:40,395
talking about the same thing. No, we're

1000
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,570
not. Yes,

1001
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:46,585
it's the travails of Realism and

1002
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:48,990
instrumentalism for Biological Active

1003
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,785
Inference episode 55 because of

1004
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:57,385
these terms, are they an examples or is

1005
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:00,550
this an example of a model being used to

1006
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:04,975
discuss a real system? But this

1007
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:07,765
suffice to say, is the architecture of

1008
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:11,450
the homeostat. It undertakes action

1009
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,160
to reduce discrepancy relative to a

1010
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:17,800
prior held belief, fixed in this case

1011
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,985
about what temperatures are expected

1012
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,455
preferred. The dialectic of the first

1013
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,160
two PS from livestream number 37. This

1014
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:31,100
is an expectation and a preference

1015
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,135
because expectations having to do with

1016
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,790
survival are as good as inference for

1017
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,412
survival over evolutionary time.

1018
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:43,200
Okay, this is going to be contrasted

1019
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:46,525
with figure three

1020
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:50,785
B, which is the alo stat. We see

1021
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:54,970
the same stack of x one

1022
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:58,387
Y one, light Bleu, dark Bleu, red,

1023
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,485
except there is now a second column next

1024
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:03,660
to it and there's some cross

1025
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:06,790
connectivity. So again, the x's are

1026
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:09,385
going to be beliefs about so prior's on

1027
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:12,625
and then these are observations. And so

1028
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:15,205
they're saying this generative model

1029
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:17,140
extends the homeostat by including a

1030
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:19,815
second set of exteroception variables

1031
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:22,435
that correspond to light intensity y,

1032
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:26,490
two observations of light, and beliefs

1033
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,440
about sunrise. So like beliefs about the

1034
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:32,410
generative process. So generative model

1035
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:33,937
of the generative process.

1036
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:37,720
Furthermore, the model includes a

1037
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:39,555
predictive relationship between sunrise

1038
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:44,110
x two and body temperature y.

1039
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,110
So again, I wish we could label every

1040
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:49,215
edge because the edges are meaning

1041
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:51,250
different things even at different

1042
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:54,570
times. Like this is a predictive

1043
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,285
relationship. So it's an anticipatory

1044
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,980
one, but then the one about light

1045
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:02,085
intensity and the belief about sunrise,

1046
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,490
there would be ways to make that an

1047
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:06,360
anticipatory or an instantaneous

1048
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,285
relationship. But the result of this

1049
00:51:10,392 --> 00:51:13,845
sketched architectures is that inferring

1050
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:16,885
a sunrise, which will only happen with

1051
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:19,335
high posterior confidence if the visual

1052
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:22,240
observations are consistent. So low

1053
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,740
prediction error inferring a sunrise,

1054
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:29,635
not quote, seeing a sunrise. That is

1055
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,675
not what is happening in the model

1056
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:34,135
inferring a sunrise and finding that

1057
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,935
visual observations are compatible with

1058
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,415
it can trigger the autonomic response.

1059
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:41,895
The behavior you of thermal regulation

1060
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,335
in an anticipatory manner, that is

1061
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,210
before sunlight actually increases body

1062
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:47,815
temperature. Well, how would the

1063
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:50,005
parameter be set that way? Because if

1064
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:52,860
that were adaptive, then other parameter

1065
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,760
accommodations have been weeded out

1066
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,970
already by evolution. So that is

1067
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,295
where we tuck the thread back into the

1068
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:02,835
ball of yarn, which is the parameter

1069
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,760
communication that are nonadaptive die,

1070
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:07,740
they dissipate, they fail to exist,

1071
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,905
they're not going to be measured as

1072
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,235
things in the culture empirically,

1073
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:15,190
however you Kant to take it. So how does

1074
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:18,025
it work? It's the same as it was 50

1075
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:20,425
years ago, which is it has to do with

1076
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:23,150
survival of the persistent. Stephen.

1077
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:28,065
And these graphs,

1078
00:52:28,095 --> 00:52:30,235
what they are used for as well as they

1079
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:34,285
do show beliefs field to the

1080
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,115
observation space. That the space

1081
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:39,800
available around the observation.

1082
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,860
Whatever the sensorium that is

1083
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:48,135
available, that's what gives the beliefs

1084
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,237
its scope. And then the

1085
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,955
expectations are tied

1086
00:52:57,015 --> 00:53:00,235
in here more clearly to action. So the

1087
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:05,085
errors, the errors are what's

1088
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:11,265
important. The actual dynamic

1089
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,000
that's driving action to change

1090
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:15,220
something is coming out of the

1091
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:17,190
prediction area. Errors that's feeding

1092
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,825
into action. I think that's quite

1093
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:24,090
important because this is like the proto

1094
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,295
animal, this is like the proto kind of

1095
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:30,940
piece here that ties into a lot

1096
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,060
of how we think about knowledge and

1097
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:36,645
meaning. And I'm not saying that I'm

1098
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,335
just extrapolating a lot, but I think it

1099
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:42,337
does show how beliefs are tied to

1100
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:46,705
the type of sensors that

1101
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:49,080
is being used to shape the conversation

1102
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,275
space. I think that's quite useful.

1103
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,262
Yeah. And these are just good.

1104
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,860
I just want to get both you guys

1105
00:53:56,892 --> 00:53:59,770
opinions about that orange bar bell at

1106
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:02,020
the bottom of the diagram, because

1107
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,975
talking identity, but we're also still

1108
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:06,805
talking about dependency, we're talking

1109
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:10,075
about duplication, we're talking

1110
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:13,585
about anticipation. So that's a lot of

1111
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,900
stuff packed in one orange barbell.

1112
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:19,615
What do you think? Yeah,

1113
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,175
I'm going back to the full caption.

1114
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,690
The red circles represent the expected

1115
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,020
values of X. So if we're

1116
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:36,160
interpreting these as the posteriors on

1117
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,505
X, because the expectations, the errors

1118
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:42,420
are the top Bleu ones, so it wouldn't

1119
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:52,935
have to be the red circles and

1120
00:54:52,967 --> 00:54:54,850
they don't mention the word orange.

1121
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:59,790
Note it's there and

1122
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:02,705
it's identity. Note the lateral

1123
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:04,910
modulatory connections in the Allostasis

1124
00:55:04,955 --> 00:55:08,820
network. See 24 for details. And 24 is

1125
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,160
the graphical brain with frist and par

1126
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:14,265
and de. Bruce so,

1127
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:16,055
yeah, again, this is just a sketch

1128
00:55:16,115 --> 00:55:17,685
module. They're not using it to fit any

1129
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:20,787
data or even simulate any data.

1130
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,460
And it does relate to what Steven said

1131
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:26,840
about the Intersensory or the intermodal

1132
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:29,415
inference, which is one could imagine a

1133
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:32,565
cognitive model where if

1134
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,140
there's noises that are associated with

1135
00:55:34,157 --> 00:55:37,890
sunrise, then beliefs about sunrise can

1136
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:39,810
be a variable with edges coming from

1137
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:41,940
different sensory modalities. So it

1138
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:45,560
gives us a exploration of the organs

1139
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:48,905
of sense and interface

1140
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:52,980
cognitive modeling. Stephen yeah,

1141
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:56,340
it gives a sense of when would something

1142
00:55:56,432 --> 00:55:59,015
be important to act upon. So there's

1143
00:55:59,045 --> 00:56:00,630
many, many things that I could believe

1144
00:56:00,677 --> 00:56:03,630
I'm seeing or being perceived in terms

1145
00:56:03,677 --> 00:56:09,090
of this is sunrise, or this

1146
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:10,965
is the type of light coming in, this is

1147
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:12,837
the nature of the light, this is where

1148
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:14,940
the light is coming from. There's all

1149
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:17,145
sorts of stuff. The stuff that's really

1150
00:56:17,222 --> 00:56:20,475
filtering down is what

1151
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:25,035
is important and

1152
00:56:25,067 --> 00:56:26,535
this is where the affordance is coming,

1153
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,525
what affords me to make some action.

1154
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,415
If it was expanding out, there can be

1155
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,380
lots of things I noticed. Like I might

1156
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:37,440
notice that there's a line there and I

1157
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:39,840
may notice and believe it's orange, but

1158
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:41,940
I may not act upon it until I take my

1159
00:56:41,957 --> 00:56:44,115
attention to it and think it's useful as

1160
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:45,465
there's many things going on on the

1161
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,665
page. So when we're we have beliefs,

1162
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:51,590
but then there's what's being acted upon

1163
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:55,587
out of all of that to then create

1164
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,280
some sort of change. So I think that is

1165
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:01,300
also quite useful in this architecture.

1166
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:09,105
Can I add to this because I think really

1167
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:12,210
important. So we're talking about

1168
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:15,540
in the context of the sun coming up,

1169
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:19,035
but let's see whether it still is

1170
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:21,540
true. And I think it is just to prove a

1171
00:57:21,557 --> 00:57:25,530
point whether that orange barbell still

1172
00:57:25,577 --> 00:57:27,462
makes sense. If we're talking about

1173
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,070
Daniel anticipating 61 year old Daniel

1174
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,390
and Stephen anticipating 61 year old

1175
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:36,615
Steven, and Dean anticipating 61 year

1176
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:39,615
old Dean, now I'm much closer to 61 than

1177
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:43,115
the two of you, but do I need the Monte

1178
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:45,990
Carlo? Do I need the play out to be able

1179
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,615
to make that anticipation? As long as I

1180
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,425
have the identity and the parallelism

1181
00:57:51,575 --> 00:57:53,505
and the backwards and forwards looking

1182
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:56,790
dependency that we see between X one and

1183
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,895
X two and Y one and Y two, that's what I

1184
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:04,530
think makes this a very interesting way

1185
00:58:04,577 --> 00:58:06,885
of being able to sort of build on the

1186
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,837
previous homeostatic examples.

1187
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:15,087
Klaas. Stephan yeah, I think also this

1188
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:19,035
speaks to traditionally we

1189
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:20,610
think about the meaning, what does this

1190
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:21,915
mean, what's all the meaning out there?

1191
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,135
As you mentioned, all the data, the

1192
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,640
stuff that it could mean to relate all

1193
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:28,675
these variables. But ultimately,

1194
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:33,935
and the bit that is actually what active

1195
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,940
inference gives us is that barbell is

1196
00:58:35,957 --> 00:58:37,770
where the learning comes in. It's like

1197
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,280
the way to know how being

1198
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:44,910
61 is for you Dean, is for you to

1199
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:48,660
image what it would be like to

1200
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,835
make choices and to act in the world as

1201
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:53,940
a 61 year old Dean. Not necessarily to

1202
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:58,005
go out and look at all the data,

1203
00:58:58,127 --> 00:59:00,045
so to speak, all the beliefs and the

1204
00:59:00,047 --> 00:59:01,335
things we think about the world, but to

1205
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,510
actually bring that in. And of course

1206
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:05,235
you've got a better chance to do that

1207
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,610
because you're closer to being that kind

1208
00:59:08,642 --> 00:59:11,160
of Dean. So I think that's quite

1209
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:12,555
interesting. That barbed at the bottom

1210
00:59:12,602 --> 00:59:17,085
in terms of pairing together the

1211
00:59:17,117 --> 00:59:19,590
kind of beliefs about what actions and

1212
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:22,640
prediction Brea are available and it's

1213
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,605
more into that meaningful action,

1214
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:27,810
meaningfulness realm, rather than what

1215
00:59:27,842 --> 00:59:30,175
does it mean? What's the data Jelle?

1216
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,890
We might get there. And I'm not pushing

1217
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,805
back on what you're saying, Stephen, we

1218
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:38,412
might get there. But I think for now,

1219
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,480
what we're saying is that in order to

1220
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:46,887
get there, we have to have more than a

1221
00:59:48,825 --> 00:59:52,900
single stack of dependencies.

1222
00:59:53,325 --> 00:59:56,865
We have to have a double stack in

1223
00:59:56,882 --> 01:00:00,285
order to be able to extend the

1224
01:00:00,317 --> 01:00:03,810
homeostatic nature of

1225
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,537
how we've evolved to where we are.

1226
01:00:07,575 --> 01:00:09,440
Again, I'm not pushing back on you. I'm

1227
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,135
just saying I don't want to jump that

1228
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,775
firing pistol just yet because I think

1229
01:00:14,837 --> 01:00:16,635
that orange barbell is going to turn

1230
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,665
into a green arrow and then all hell's

1231
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:20,790
going to break loose anyway, so we

1232
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:22,830
should carry on. I don't want to take

1233
01:00:22,877 --> 01:00:26,040
Stephen stuff away, but I think I want

1234
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:27,360
to park it because we're going to go

1235
01:00:27,392 --> 01:00:30,740
somewhere in a minute. I'm hesitant

1236
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:34,295
to ascribe too much specificity

1237
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:36,420
to something that wasn't labeled in the

1238
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:38,480
caption. Doesn't have a clear labeling

1239
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,805
in the figure either. But I think it is

1240
01:00:41,852 --> 01:00:44,295
already demonstrated that using

1241
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:46,535
graphical framework and partitionings

1242
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,735
like we have in active inference, we can

1243
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,655
start to approach some of these

1244
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:53,840
questions like how would different kinds

1245
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,910
of variables be connected? How does that

1246
01:00:56,942 --> 01:01:00,125
relate to future inference on action

1247
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,705
counterfactuals, etc. Okay, so these

1248
01:01:03,752 --> 01:01:07,770
sections 4567 were

1249
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:10,605
just laying out the relationship between

1250
01:01:10,802 --> 01:01:12,830
an evolutionary or a physiological

1251
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:15,990
function like homeostasis allostasis or

1252
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:18,660
simple behavioral control models of

1253
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:21,035
things that are core evolutionary

1254
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,645
features and function, connecting them

1255
01:01:24,797 --> 01:01:27,410
to the kinds of internal representation,

1256
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:29,540
which are like a little bit of a hybrid

1257
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,510
of a Bayesian graph and a

1258
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,940
factor graph because there's some kind

1259
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:38,955
of computations being implied here,

1260
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:41,300
whereas in a Bayesian graph, the edges

1261
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,610
only reflect statistical dependencies,

1262
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,585
whereas we're bringing in a little bit

1263
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:47,910
more of like a nuanced type relationship

1264
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:50,685
that one could imagine could be

1265
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:53,715
unpacked. A bit more were to be

1266
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:57,975
specified. But it's just to show how

1267
01:01:58,112 --> 01:02:02,735
different graphical models relate

1268
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:06,860
to different brain architectures

1269
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:09,840
underpinnings whether you think this is

1270
01:02:09,857 --> 01:02:13,115
the actual architectures or whether it's

1271
01:02:13,145 --> 01:02:15,165
just an instrumental architecture like a

1272
01:02:15,182 --> 01:02:18,025
model structure on a given phenomena.

1273
01:02:19,275 --> 01:02:22,110
How do model architectures relate to

1274
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:25,950
evolutionary functions? Where is

1275
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:28,980
evolutionary time in this model? We

1276
01:02:29,027 --> 01:02:31,035
started out by asking like, how do

1277
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:34,385
cognitive phenotypes arise specifically

1278
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,195
over evolutionary but also over

1279
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:38,415
developmental time? And that's where we

1280
01:02:38,432 --> 01:02:40,935
get to one of the main pieces and

1281
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:43,587
contributions of the paper, which is

1282
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,960
figure four, the five main dimensions

1283
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:49,620
of elaboration of generative model

1284
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:52,662
models introduced in this paper. So

1285
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:56,715
there are other kinds of Chang Kim

1286
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,145
ways that this structure could evolve,

1287
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,520
but they're going to focus on these

1288
01:02:59,597 --> 01:03:02,670
five. There's starting with the

1289
01:03:02,672 --> 01:03:04,905
homeostat. Does it leave to be our

1290
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:07,620
starting point? Maybe not. Starting with

1291
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:11,210
the homeostat, there's the I operation,

1292
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,835
which is identity unchanged. There is

1293
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:17,435
I plus I, which is just a parallel

1294
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,835
isolated duplication that's like from

1295
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:23,025
one photoreceptor to going to two

1296
01:03:23,087 --> 01:03:25,680
photoreceptors, so to speak. There's the

1297
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:28,815
alastat, which is a implication as well

1298
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:31,875
as a cross linking. So these are just

1299
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:34,185
sketches. One could also probably write

1300
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:36,770
that one as like a duplication followed

1301
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,580
by a linking and there's no like change

1302
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:41,415
in linking, for example here. So this is

1303
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:45,025
like a few of a taxonomy of operations.

1304
01:03:45,525 --> 01:03:48,365
There's increases in temporal depth

1305
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,955
within a level of the hierarchy. So

1306
01:03:51,002 --> 01:03:54,837
looking one more unit further in time

1307
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,535
at a given time scale and then there's

1308
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,815
hierarchical nesting with a h. And the

1309
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:03,585
figure is shown like this because these

1310
01:04:03,617 --> 01:04:05,790
are like the things that can happen to

1311
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:09,270
the homeostat and then they can have a

1312
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:11,412
second round and so on and so on.

1313
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,860
There's so many other ones that could

1314
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:16,190
happen. Like where is reduction,

1315
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,805
where's loss, where's deduplication,

1316
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,465
where's the uncoupling of the

1317
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,480
allostasis? Reduction of temporal depth,

1318
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,415
reduction of hierarchy. So there's a

1319
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:28,785
broad space. But one of the main

1320
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:30,960
contributions of this paper is to

1321
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,955
connect functionally oriented graphical

1322
01:04:35,015 --> 01:04:38,105
models of homeostatic and physiological

1323
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:42,625
function to the operations

1324
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,330
that result in the elaboration of

1325
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:48,090
simpler model architectures into

1326
01:04:48,257 --> 01:04:51,135
different architectures. Steen, this is

1327
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,610
an interesting part. I know Steven wants

1328
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:56,370
to say something to but really quickly,

1329
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,665
there's no plus minus multiply and

1330
01:04:58,682 --> 01:05:01,235
divide. There's an operation,

1331
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:05,355
but there's no symbolism for that.

1332
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:08,835
And again, that keeps it

1333
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:11,835
safe on a statistical level. I think

1334
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:14,910
that's a nice tell there.

1335
01:05:15,092 --> 01:05:17,370
Again, for somebody who's just sort of

1336
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,245
looking at this for the first time,

1337
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:22,020
pointing that out, it's not there and

1338
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:24,435
because it's not present, that tells us

1339
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:27,015
something to your point about maybe how

1340
01:05:27,032 --> 01:05:29,425
do we get implication?

1341
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,740
Yes, well, I plus I it

1342
01:05:34,757 --> 01:05:38,835
is like it's a suggestive use

1343
01:05:38,942 --> 01:05:41,610
of the addition operator, but we're not

1344
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:44,760
adding these just like integers. So yes,

1345
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,050
they're kind of like categorical

1346
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:50,585
operations that constitute

1347
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:53,855
this evolution algebra. Okay. Steven,

1348
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:56,655
anything on figure four? Yeah, I was

1349
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,335
just saying that I was saying they've

1350
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,340
set a paradigm from the homeostat

1351
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:06,840
and they've taken that through and

1352
01:06:06,857 --> 01:06:10,685
they've shown that plausibly can carry

1353
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:13,245
through to cognition. And then like you

1354
01:06:13,247 --> 01:06:14,865
say, there can be other ways. But what

1355
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:17,250
they've now given is they've given some

1356
01:06:17,312 --> 01:06:19,790
legs. Another way to think of the legs

1357
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,965
that can be attached to that paradigm

1358
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:23,715
because this modern approach, while they

1359
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:25,380
could have chosen a lot of others by

1360
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:27,840
taking it, there are certain things that

1361
01:06:27,857 --> 01:06:30,440
you're hard baked into that early stage

1362
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,585
choicemaking which then makes other

1363
01:06:33,617 --> 01:06:36,162
paradigms wouldn't fit with it. Right?

1364
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,150
Even if you go instrumental realist,

1365
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,635
your instrumental models, your realist

1366
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,060
models don't make sense unless you with

1367
01:06:45,092 --> 01:06:47,115
this, unless you take in some of the

1368
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:50,275
paradigms of this structuring creates.

1369
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,630
Yeah, agreed. Thanks. So just maybe

1370
01:06:56,677 --> 01:07:00,485
think like is this functional model

1371
01:07:00,592 --> 01:07:03,695
realism? Like the function of the model

1372
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:07,340
is what is being tracked through time

1373
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:10,862
and so there's many other

1374
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,630
alterations that could occur and then

1375
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:18,035
there's even more granular like

1376
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,865
parametric changes or changes in

1377
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:22,865
connectivity or edge types. And then I

1378
01:07:22,882 --> 01:07:26,270
think as you

1379
01:07:26,272 --> 01:07:28,350
said, Dean, when all hell breaks loose.

1380
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,595
What's interesting here, let's look at

1381
01:07:31,597 --> 01:07:34,315
the alo stat in a little bit closer

1382
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:37,595
detail. Okay? So previously we looked at

1383
01:07:37,597 --> 01:07:39,650
the alistat and we were like, okay,

1384
01:07:39,712 --> 01:07:46,152
there's an orange bar. Now the

1385
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:49,225
Alastat has a free bar.

1386
01:07:49,737 --> 01:07:51,132
It's Green Arrow and it's a

1387
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,877
unidirectional one. This one a

1388
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:54,712
dependency.

1389
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:02,997
The Alo stat has

1390
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:05,847
the green bar. Okay, well, those are my

1391
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,792
bad eyes because I saw the little arrow

1392
01:08:08,927 --> 01:08:11,477
from the Bleu actually turning. I didn't

1393
01:08:11,507 --> 01:08:13,292
actually see that there was two circles.

1394
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:16,842
Thank you. There's my 60 year old eyes

1395
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,325
for you. Yeah.

1396
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:23,352
Okay, cool. And so

1397
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,977
each of these are in quite a different

1398
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,975
domain or at least like a different

1399
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:32,652
aspect of cognition. And these are

1400
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:35,337
the transitions that it can engage in.

1401
01:08:35,475 --> 01:08:38,712
So, like, duplication retains the exact

1402
01:08:38,775 --> 01:08:40,377
same function, but it's a very important

1403
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,642
step. And that's a little bit what

1404
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,822
explored in the zero with genetic

1405
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,022
duplications, like on the left side here

1406
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:50,942
at the screen, having a region

1407
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:54,732
of the genome duplicate. Yes, one of

1408
01:08:54,735 --> 01:08:56,397
the duplicate copies can just

1409
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,552
degenerate. That may be like opening

1410
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:02,517
up space or creating motifs for other

1411
01:09:02,565 --> 01:09:04,452
kinds of later evolutionary steps. So

1412
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,957
even this is not like a failure, it's

1413
01:09:05,972 --> 01:09:08,447
just a change. There's neo

1414
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,677
functionalization, where then those two

1415
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:12,852
models can start to subspecify. Like if

1416
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,027
you only have one photoreceptor, it has

1417
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:16,572
to be doing what it's doing. But

1418
01:09:16,605 --> 01:09:20,547
duplicating, it then allows one

1419
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,227
to focus on a different wavelength than

1420
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:25,262
the other, for example. And then there's

1421
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,432
sub functionalization, which is where

1422
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:30,700
initially a composite function, a B

1423
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:34,892
becomes two, like enzymes

1424
01:09:34,952 --> 01:09:37,842
start to subspecialize on one of the two

1425
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,657
functions of the ancestral. So it's kind

1426
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,552
of like a role duplication. So

1427
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:45,175
duplication is an important event.

1428
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:49,172
Then there's the Alo stat and multiple

1429
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:51,942
things happen with A. But we're seeing

1430
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,467
it as there is a implication occurring

1431
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:58,292
and there's also cross linking occurring

1432
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,437
between beliefs in one modality or

1433
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,192
beliefs about one type of thing

1434
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:07,107
influencing observations or

1435
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,572
about another kind of thing, as well

1436
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:14,662
as this lateral modulatory, green orange

1437
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:16,750
bar.

1438
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:22,712
And then we have two kinds of expansions

1439
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:25,992
into temporal depth, a sort of local

1440
01:10:26,115 --> 01:10:29,772
expansion with the T operation just

1441
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,622
pushing the model one step deeper. And

1442
01:10:32,655 --> 01:10:34,697
then the H hierarchical nesting

1443
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:37,827
operation. Which brings it to another

1444
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,602
timescale analysis. Dean and this is

1445
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,942
where I really struggled. And that is

1446
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:45,822
when you were at Alastat, it wasn't just

1447
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:47,802
comparative. I felt like you had to

1448
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,102
build in time, especially if we're

1449
01:10:50,132 --> 01:10:53,547
talking about identity. But then it was

1450
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,927
like, no, we're just going to leave a

1451
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:56,622
comparative and then we're going to

1452
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:59,022
introduce the wedding of this. I mean,

1453
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,047
I understand why they're doing that to

1454
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,902
try to make it tractable, but I don't

1455
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:06,147
know how they can say it can be

1456
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,447
comparative learning. I know active

1457
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,650
inference between A and B right now,

1458
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:16,227
but not sort of address the fact that in

1459
01:11:16,245 --> 01:11:18,627
order to differentiate into A and B,

1460
01:11:18,795 --> 01:11:21,852
some amount of time had to had to

1461
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:23,512
be applied to that split.

1462
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:28,602
I was saying you have to go back in time

1463
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:30,732
in order to just be able to do a

1464
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:33,417
comparison. So it's temporal only going

1465
01:11:33,465 --> 01:11:35,322
forward in time. I don't mean all hell

1466
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:37,722
broke loose, but I mean, I did ask this

1467
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:40,825
question. You're right. Like here

1468
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:43,632
there's the triggering in an

1469
01:11:43,635 --> 01:11:47,067
anticipatory manner. And so in one view,

1470
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:48,822
it's like, but this is a single time

1471
01:11:48,855 --> 01:11:51,562
step model, so how could that occur?

1472
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:53,552
Because it doesn't have a temporal

1473
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:56,322
depth. On the other hand,

1474
01:11:56,505 --> 01:11:58,842
again, like kind of those two senses of

1475
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,227
representation in the structural sense,

1476
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,892
if the model is a single time step

1477
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,087
model, it kant have a representation

1478
01:12:05,162 --> 01:12:07,152
through deep time ergo, it cannot be

1479
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,152
anticipatory function. The other side of

1480
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,857
the coin would be if it's enough at this

1481
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:17,397
time step, such that beliefs about

1482
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,832
sunrise, trigger and response, the model

1483
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,997
can be functionally anticipatory without

1484
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,877
a temporal depth representation. Which

1485
01:12:26,895 --> 01:12:28,977
is why the representation discussion was

1486
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:30,957
very important leading up to this one,

1487
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,582
because we're all over those eight

1488
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,302
quadrants here, because in

1489
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,772
evolution and this is something that

1490
01:12:38,805 --> 01:12:41,262
like cognitive psych people talk about

1491
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,762
is like our

1492
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:47,607
cognition being shaped towards

1493
01:12:47,685 --> 01:12:50,612
effective, which is to say productive

1494
01:12:50,762 --> 01:12:52,900
reproductive success,

1495
01:12:53,862 --> 01:12:55,652
not towards like, ultimate truth

1496
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:59,022
discovery. And so should we be too

1497
01:12:59,055 --> 01:13:01,237
surprised that our interpretation,

1498
01:13:02,112 --> 01:13:04,247
which has had a certain objective

1499
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:08,575
function, is then susceptible to

1500
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:12,462
being convinced about things that are

1501
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:16,517
not true? I don't socialize

1502
01:13:16,577 --> 01:13:19,527
with those people. So I don't know. I

1503
01:13:19,545 --> 01:13:21,522
just knew that when I was looking at it,

1504
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,025
I was thinking in real practical terms,

1505
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:26,757
what is built into this in order for it

1506
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,472
to still make sense? And that wasn't

1507
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:31,172
necessarily parsed out in the diagram.

1508
01:13:31,217 --> 01:13:34,272
You kind of had to fill that in through

1509
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:35,772
your own interpretation of what was

1510
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:38,887
going on. So thus back to discrepancy.

1511
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:41,127
That discrepancy thing is going to come

1512
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:42,602
up again and again, and I'm really glad

1513
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:44,437
that they inserted it at the beginning.

1514
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:49,277
Klaas. E. Stephan think it's useful

1515
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,252
here to hear this temporal depth and

1516
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,912
hierarchical depth being sort of

1517
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,057
spelled out, because I think it's

1518
01:13:59,072 --> 01:14:00,777
sometimes it's a little confusing in

1519
01:14:00,795 --> 01:14:03,387
other papers quite where it fits. So

1520
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,127
temporal depth and this, again, might be

1521
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:06,777
where some of this ontology work can be

1522
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:09,177
useful, just to see if that can be kind

1523
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,757
of consistent. But if temporal depth is,

1524
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:15,087
you've got variables for past, present

1525
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,112
and future states, but they're operating

1526
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:23,887
maybe within the same kind of dynamics.

1527
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:27,325
And then if you've got different

1528
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:33,662
temporal rates operating

1529
01:14:33,812 --> 01:14:36,792
simultaneously, then you get that

1530
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,477
hierarchical depth. And I thought in the

1531
01:14:39,495 --> 01:14:41,777
past, I sometimes thought temporal depth

1532
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:43,647
would have covered that more

1533
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,297
hierarchical depth. So this

1534
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,992
is interesting to think about whether

1535
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,887
this might be actually the way that

1536
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,850
differentiation is best made.

1537
01:14:58,137 --> 01:14:59,982
Differentiation is probably best made

1538
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,517
with reference to a specific model. And

1539
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,622
this gives us the design language and

1540
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:08,727
the grammar and the motifs. So if we

1541
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:11,050
want to predict 100 years in the future,

1542
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:16,122
should we have a decade model

1543
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:20,022
with ten year models? That's a

1544
01:15:20,055 --> 01:15:23,427
times depth of ten decades and then a

1545
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:26,125
nested model with a depth of ten years

1546
01:15:26,862 --> 01:15:31,092
or so. We have a one layer model with

1547
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,692
100. They're very different

1548
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:36,252
and it's not to say that one is like

1549
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,652
more accurate or less and depending on

1550
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,572
how the exact situation is set up,

1551
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,252
maybe the computational requirements of

1552
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,127
one or higher or different than the

1553
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:46,797
other. But that's the discussion to

1554
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:49,697
have. Do we want to have a B transition

1555
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:53,217
matrix? Let's look at a nested model

1556
01:15:53,265 --> 01:15:57,972
with temporal depth. So here we

1557
01:15:58,005 --> 01:16:01,572
have on the top level of the model s

1558
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,297
state two, this is temporal

1559
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:08,127
depth happening at the upper level of

1560
01:16:08,145 --> 01:16:10,947
the model, three discrete time points in

1561
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,122
an upper level that is temporal

1562
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:18,722
depth, there's also nesting

1563
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:22,242
within each time

1564
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:25,632
step. There's a cognitive rollout on

1565
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:27,927
three time steps. This is one type of

1566
01:16:27,945 --> 01:16:29,822
nested model but there's other nestings

1567
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:33,677
that can exist. So here we see a depth

1568
01:16:33,782 --> 01:16:38,200
of two and then at each level

1569
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:41,597
of the nesting there's three temporal

1570
01:16:41,642 --> 01:16:45,152
depth but they're

1571
01:16:45,257 --> 01:16:47,202
totally different in architectures and

1572
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,332
in function. So it is the interesting

1573
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:53,502
discussion, especially when

1574
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,322
we have to do multiscale prediction like

1575
01:16:56,355 --> 01:16:58,877
Fermi estimation. So if the prediction

1576
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:02,007
is within one time scale there

1577
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:05,622
isn't necessarily a need to least but

1578
01:17:05,805 --> 01:17:08,127
once we get into larger time scales or

1579
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,247
where there's emergence over multiple

1580
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,582
timescales, it makes sense to have a

1581
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:13,872
nesting model. Like if we wanted to

1582
01:17:13,905 --> 01:17:16,137
predict someone's activity over the next

1583
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,912
seven DAGs, it might make sense to have

1584
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,512
a day model with a nested model inside

1585
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:26,097
of that, because then within each day

1586
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:28,697
there could be parameter setting versus

1587
01:17:28,742 --> 01:17:31,272
just trying to fit one time series and

1588
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:34,287
find the parameters that make that one

1589
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,647
time series oscillate in a circadian

1590
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:40,062
way. Instead we just need a day model

1591
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,967
with a very specific kind of simple

1592
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,992
transition and then a transition at a

1593
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,932
nested level with a depth that is

1594
01:17:46,935 --> 01:17:48,647
measured at the hourly or the minute

1595
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:50,847
time scale rather than the days. And

1596
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,497
that becomes especially important when

1597
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:55,422
doing familybased model fitting like

1598
01:17:55,455 --> 01:17:57,627
variational inference. So we're not just

1599
01:17:57,645 --> 01:17:59,127
like getting all the data points and

1600
01:17:59,145 --> 01:18:01,272
fitting a spline through them, but we

1601
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:04,017
actually need to have appropriate model

1602
01:18:04,065 --> 01:18:06,417
structure otherwise free energy

1603
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:08,652
minimization will drive right off the

1604
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,517
cliff just like we talked about with

1605
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,102
axles bacterium. So if we want to do

1606
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,412
free energy minimization and model

1607
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:21,412
selection on model structures,

1608
01:18:22,062 --> 01:18:24,197
we can find the best model relatively

1609
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:26,147
easily given the families that we've

1610
01:18:26,192 --> 01:18:28,622
specified. But there's no guarantees

1611
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,127
once we step outside of that spotlight

1612
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,437
that we're even in the right category

1613
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:37,292
structurally. And so that's why humans

1614
01:18:37,427 --> 01:18:39,942
having these design motifs in mind and

1615
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:43,047
many many many more helps us not get

1616
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,827
into what seems to be a global

1617
01:18:45,857 --> 01:18:48,642
optimization based upon free energy

1618
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,277
minimization but actually is a very

1619
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,477
relatively local optimization based upon

1620
01:18:53,582 --> 01:18:55,932
unimaginative model structured learning.

1621
01:18:56,085 --> 01:18:59,367
Steven yeah, thanks, that's really

1622
01:18:59,415 --> 01:19:02,882
helpful. Also ties Hinton something I've

1623
01:19:02,897 --> 01:19:04,752
been really thinking about in terms of.

1624
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,702
The modeling itself is these scales,

1625
01:19:08,732 --> 01:19:09,702
these steps. You know, you're talking

1626
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,647
about the multi year decades when we're

1627
01:19:12,692 --> 01:19:14,772
modeling, it's like, what do we have

1628
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:18,432
access to? So we tend to ascribe that in

1629
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:20,397
terms of what can we externalize, what

1630
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:24,387
can we use to put something into a model

1631
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,932
if it's instrumental? And then of

1632
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:27,417
course, there's a question of, well,

1633
01:19:27,465 --> 01:19:29,952
what is the realist perspective on that

1634
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:32,592
and what is there that's within our

1635
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,677
conscious awareness of being in the

1636
01:19:34,695 --> 01:19:36,927
world, something that can be reported as

1637
01:19:36,945 --> 01:19:40,922
an event, a story, and what timescales

1638
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:43,467
are present there? When you get into 100

1639
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:45,377
years, it's beyond that. So then you're

1640
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,527
saying, okay, what are you going to

1641
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:48,872
extrapolate? What sort of temporal

1642
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,897
structure? But on the other scale, if

1643
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:55,422
I'm asking what do I think I expect you

1644
01:19:55,455 --> 01:19:58,797
to do next, or Dean to do next? And it

1645
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:01,287
might seem intuitive, I can have a whole

1646
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,832
series of temporal and nested

1647
01:20:04,922 --> 01:20:07,197
scales going on which is not even

1648
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:10,937
available to me in a cognitive

1649
01:20:11,012 --> 01:20:14,202
conscious way. I might have a sense of a

1650
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,527
feel for what I think is going on, but a

1651
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:20,352
lot of my predictive processing will be

1652
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,802
happening at rates unavailable to my

1653
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,867
conscious awareness. So that also ties

1654
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,302
in, I suppose. I'm not saying it's an

1655
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,122
answer, sort of adds to the challenge,

1656
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,592
I suppose, but it is the challenge of

1657
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,397
how much ends up being what we can get a

1658
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,622
measure on to put into our model as much

1659
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:40,647
as what it is. And that's the same

1660
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,477
challenge in a way that comes even from

1661
01:20:42,495 --> 01:20:44,697
the realist perspective at some level as

1662
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:48,402
an organism. What is it that I even can

1663
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:51,942
access in some realistic way? Not saying

1664
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,552
we can model it or know that could be

1665
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,052
put into something like this. So I think

1666
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,100
you're going to say something.

1667
01:20:59,937 --> 01:21:02,922
So the paper is talking about how do we

1668
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:06,402
use certain math to be able

1669
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,607
to understand maybe the evolution of

1670
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:11,552
cognition, right? That's essentially

1671
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:14,532
what the paper is trying to point us in

1672
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:17,577
that direction. So again, in order to

1673
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:19,302
make this accessible, in order to sort

1674
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,027
of lower the barrier for people who

1675
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,172
actually want to have this make sense

1676
01:21:23,205 --> 01:21:25,375
because they don't necessarily spend

1677
01:21:25,737 --> 01:21:27,927
sums and sums of hours on trying to

1678
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:29,297
figure this stuff out, like the authors

1679
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:32,697
or maybe even us. I Kant to point

1680
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,602
out something that I think is obvious to

1681
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,477
us, but maybe not so obvious to people

1682
01:21:36,495 --> 01:21:38,427
who are looking at this and going, I

1683
01:21:38,445 --> 01:21:40,902
have no idea what they're saying. I

1684
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,302
think, first of all is that there's a

1685
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:46,002
chronology which we keep going back to,

1686
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:48,400
not just at the temporal depth level,

1687
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:51,102
so that's relativity math. There's brain

1688
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,282
evolution aspect of this, so that's

1689
01:21:53,372 --> 01:21:55,817
algebraic math and there's a dependency,

1690
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,347
so there's a statistical math. Do we

1691
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,852
have to be polymath in order to be able

1692
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:03,752
to feel our way through this? And I'm

1693
01:22:03,782 --> 01:22:05,172
going to go back to what I said at the

1694
01:22:05,205 --> 01:22:07,825
end of the 37,

1695
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:10,872
Karl Friston said, you don't have to be

1696
01:22:10,905 --> 01:22:13,572
polymath, but you better be at least

1697
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:16,277
somewhat comfortable feeling comfortable

1698
01:22:16,457 --> 01:22:18,537
with the math, because there's no one

1699
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,182
math that's going to get you here. It's

1700
01:22:21,197 --> 01:22:23,477
a blending of all of them, and then it's

1701
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:26,757
how you feel about that. That's probably

1702
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:31,032
going to be the thing that lowers the

1703
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:34,137
impediment to really being able to use

1704
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,717
this now in real practical terms going

1705
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:39,017
forward. So what's the next evolutionary

1706
01:22:39,077 --> 01:22:41,202
step? Right. It's how you're able to

1707
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:45,177
turn this into something. So I

1708
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:47,172
think that's one of the great gifts of

1709
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:50,352
this paper. If you're not afraid of

1710
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,482
being, if you don't consider, if you

1711
01:22:52,485 --> 01:22:54,332
don't Kant to identify now or you don't

1712
01:22:54,347 --> 01:22:57,152
duplicate now, or you don't allostasis

1713
01:22:57,182 --> 01:23:00,452
now as a polymath, maybe that's

1714
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:04,392
something we owe people

1715
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,400
that want to get into this.

1716
01:23:08,187 --> 01:23:11,962
Maybe the British pronunciation of maths

1717
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:15,132
helps reflect that. There's already a

1718
01:23:15,135 --> 01:23:18,422
plurality of maths. And Kirby Earner,

1719
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,442
coming more from the cybernetics side,

1720
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:22,272
talks a lot about this, actually. Like

1721
01:23:22,305 --> 01:23:24,747
how the discourse around math as

1722
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,642
universal language makes it sound like

1723
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:31,182
math is a singular language, when

1724
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,692
actually math is a pluriverse. And so

1725
01:23:34,815 --> 01:23:36,925
maths reflects that a little better.

1726
01:23:38,037 --> 01:23:41,875
It's not like these are just sort of

1727
01:23:42,237 --> 01:23:45,047
slopes on one mountain and that's Mount

1728
01:23:45,092 --> 01:23:47,322
Math, and it's so high and only a few

1729
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,407
people get to the top and scale every

1730
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,187
side. This is just like we're using

1731
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:56,522
maths. Yes. Of all different klaas.

1732
01:23:56,567 --> 01:23:59,952
Stephan. You see a lot

1733
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,277
of this in the papers that are published

1734
01:24:01,307 --> 01:24:02,892
active inference lab. There's often a

1735
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,422
team of people, a group of people,

1736
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:07,062
where maybe one member has that higher

1737
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,002
level understanding the math. But the

1738
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,467
other question is to understand what

1739
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,412
would it mean to make an observation

1740
01:24:15,987 --> 01:24:17,127
that could be a very good the

1741
01:24:17,145 --> 01:24:19,497
mathematician may not be the one. Like

1742
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,147
some of the work with Ryan Smith's work

1743
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,472
on the gut, you know, it was like,

1744
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:25,922
well, they're going to do gut inference.

1745
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:28,987
Well, how do you get some tractable

1746
01:24:29,562 --> 01:24:33,147
source on what's the gut doing? So they

1747
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:35,052
created some electrode. I'm not quite

1748
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,072
sure Hohwy they did it, but they had

1749
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,432
some way of getting sensory information,

1750
01:24:39,585 --> 01:24:41,532
effectively sensory information, or

1751
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,227
effectively some sort of information to

1752
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:47,275
put into their model. And so knowing how

1753
01:24:47,937 --> 01:24:51,762
action and observations can

1754
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:54,957
flow in and the implications of that, I

1755
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,917
think, is also kind of a big part

1756
01:24:58,965 --> 01:25:02,817
of this. Right. And in some

1757
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:05,847
cases it may be a trivial part because

1758
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,847
it's fairly obvious. In other parts,

1759
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:11,212
that may be the biggest barrier,

1760
01:25:11,712 --> 01:25:13,202
and then that may be the biggest barrier

1761
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:15,775
as well, often in organisms. Right.

1762
01:25:16,587 --> 01:25:19,572
How do you even access plausibly, the

1763
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:21,775
approximation science, which isn't so

1764
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:24,452
approximately it's just chaos that it's

1765
01:25:24,482 --> 01:25:28,482
tractable. Yeah. The rate limiting step

1766
01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:32,472
or impact and improvement in

1767
01:25:32,505 --> 01:25:35,712
the real world is unlikely to be any

1768
01:25:35,775 --> 01:25:38,877
single individual's conceptualization of

1769
01:25:38,895 --> 01:25:42,702
math on a team if

1770
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,852
it's structured appropriately. And for

1771
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,642
those pushing the frontiers of math.

1772
01:25:47,702 --> 01:25:49,722
Their understanding of math is quite

1773
01:25:49,755 --> 01:25:52,675
literally a rate living step for them.

1774
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:54,897
Or maybe it might be something very

1775
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:58,122
mundane like time availability. But when

1776
01:25:58,155 --> 01:26:00,762
it comes to thinking about real model

1777
01:26:00,825 --> 01:26:02,837
based science and translational

1778
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:04,912
implication of active inference,

1779
01:26:07,512 --> 01:26:09,567
I think that we're working towards new

1780
01:26:09,615 --> 01:26:12,702
ways of combining skills and having

1781
01:26:12,795 --> 01:26:14,667
shared knowledge resources that help

1782
01:26:14,715 --> 01:26:18,572
make that make sense and using shared

1783
01:26:18,617 --> 01:26:21,497
language and ontologies narratives,

1784
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:24,372
formal documents, tools on Ft because

1785
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:25,802
we're doing it on teams and we're

1786
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:30,042
online. Let's just in the last 2030

1787
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:33,477
minutes go through the final pieces of

1788
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:35,232
the paper so that this dot one will have

1789
01:26:35,235 --> 01:26:37,687
been like a first sweep,

1790
01:26:38,112 --> 01:26:40,767
initial pheromone deposition, and then

1791
01:26:40,815 --> 01:26:43,157
we can return and take some cul de sacs,

1792
01:26:43,247 --> 01:26:47,275
etc. So, action nine,

1793
01:26:48,012 --> 01:26:50,747
explore a little bit how the duplication

1794
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:54,702
operation allows for

1795
01:26:54,795 --> 01:26:58,352
multiple behaviors to arise and that's

1796
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:02,372
sort of by analogy to the genomic

1797
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,947
duplications and specializations and all

1798
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,712
those different routes that can occur

1799
01:27:10,662 --> 01:27:14,727
here. They connected duplication a

1800
01:27:14,745 --> 01:27:18,527
little bit more directly to the factor

1801
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:20,062
graph models.

1802
01:27:24,462 --> 01:27:27,572
In. The sense that duplicated motifs

1803
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,517
have dynamics that are conserved over

1804
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:31,947
different sensory motor domains. So

1805
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,277
let's just say that we just had a visual

1806
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:36,852
model, it was a column of visual and

1807
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,472
then we duplicated it. So now we have

1808
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:41,312
two photoreceptors with parallel columns

1809
01:27:41,462 --> 01:27:44,337
and now the photoreceptor in the second

1810
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,192
one changes into a chemo receptor

1811
01:27:47,327 --> 01:27:49,772
because instead of expressing Rhodopsin

1812
01:27:49,817 --> 01:27:52,472
protein, it's expressing an olfactory

1813
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:56,172
receptor protein. There can be

1814
01:27:56,205 --> 01:27:58,872
a conversation of the dynamics of

1815
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:02,552
inference even when the observation

1816
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:05,172
has changed. But it was a slot for

1817
01:28:05,205 --> 01:28:07,422
observation. And so we went from having

1818
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:10,442
like monocular vision to binocular

1819
01:28:10,502 --> 01:28:14,427
vision to monocular vision and

1820
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:17,172
olfactory perception. But you can't get

1821
01:28:17,205 --> 01:28:19,697
there in one jump to just like duplicate

1822
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:22,947
and transpose. It's not likely to happen

1823
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:26,142
in brain evolution context. And we can

1824
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:30,047
see the structure of these hierarchical

1825
01:28:30,092 --> 01:28:33,492
model as equivalent to being

1826
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,112
factorized probability distributions,

1827
01:28:36,462 --> 01:28:37,952
which is to say that the sparse

1828
01:28:37,982 --> 01:28:41,502
connectivity of variables means that we

1829
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,202
can make parts of the model that can be

1830
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,677
like fine tuned independently in a way

1831
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:48,512
that can be fit very attractively.

1832
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:50,552
That's the factor graph, that's

1833
01:28:50,582 --> 01:28:52,502
factorized Bayesian inference. And we've

1834
01:28:52,532 --> 01:28:54,372
talked about that in other places. But

1835
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:56,697
just here all we need to say is

1836
01:28:56,805 --> 01:29:00,357
duplication enables like A control

1837
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:03,347
C control V copy paste and then let's

1838
01:29:03,392 --> 01:29:06,117
edit the other version. But that can now

1839
01:29:06,165 --> 01:29:09,177
happen with evolution features and

1840
01:29:09,195 --> 01:29:11,727
functions. Dean, real quick, your hand

1841
01:29:11,745 --> 01:29:14,050
gestures in this section point to the

1842
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:19,002
orthogonal mesh beginning and

1843
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,057
then .2 I'd like to pull that apart a

1844
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,187
little bit, but let's carry on. But

1845
01:29:23,325 --> 01:29:25,977
that's what I took away from this. The

1846
01:29:25,995 --> 01:29:29,022
mesh began and in the beginning there

1847
01:29:29,055 --> 01:29:32,517
was a mesh begins. We'll return

1848
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:35,500
to that for dot two.

1849
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:40,052
Okay, section ten talks

1850
01:29:40,082 --> 01:29:43,842
about temporal depth. It's about

1851
01:29:43,965 --> 01:29:46,857
time and about the encoding of

1852
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,647
generative models with temporal depth

1853
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:50,222
and the way that that supports

1854
01:29:50,267 --> 01:29:53,697
prospective inference, anticipation or

1855
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,592
retrospective inference, which is like

1856
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:00,197
memory. So here's what the operator

1857
01:30:00,242 --> 01:30:03,327
looks like. We have X sub tau x at a

1858
01:30:03,345 --> 01:30:05,402
time point, and then now there's X tau

1859
01:30:05,432 --> 01:30:08,892
plus one the next time point, or t

1860
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,747
plus one could be now, and then t

1861
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,642
could be the last moment.

1862
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,147
So memory. And I

1863
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,600
still see figure four.

1864
01:30:28,062 --> 01:30:31,750
Slide 29. Okay.

1865
01:30:32,112 --> 01:30:36,562
Yeah. So the structure of anticipation

1866
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:39,897
and of memory are very similar. It just

1867
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:43,197
depends whether one has the stream of

1868
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,212
observations happening on the left side

1869
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,552
and a prospection, or the stream of

1870
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,052
observations are on the right side and

1871
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,422
in which case it's retrospection.

1872
01:30:51,467 --> 01:30:54,347
Stephen yeah, I mean, it sort of ties

1873
01:30:54,392 --> 01:30:56,202
in. They talk about what the police do

1874
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,602
is very hard for someone to lie

1875
01:30:57,632 --> 01:30:59,652
backwards. So you always get them to

1876
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:02,702
tell their story backwards because it's

1877
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:05,082
very hard for them to do that because

1878
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:08,200
they say if we're creating things

1879
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:11,622
retrospectively but playing them

1880
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:13,902
forward, so to speak, it would kind of

1881
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,100
tie them out.

1882
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:20,700
I want to emancipate that.

1883
01:31:22,262 --> 01:31:25,292
I looked up police in the paper. I see

1884
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:26,262
policies.

1885
01:31:28,487 --> 01:31:29,937
Is that policies?

1886
01:31:34,937 --> 01:31:36,577
It's a great opportunity for my favorite

1887
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:38,625
joke, but I won't thank you.

1888
01:31:41,012 --> 01:31:43,417
This action talks about temporal depth.

1889
01:31:43,552 --> 01:31:47,797
Okay. From whence temporal

1890
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:50,627
depth. Various researchers have

1891
01:31:50,645 --> 01:31:52,477
speculated that a major driving force

1892
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,052
for the development of deep temporal

1893
01:31:54,082 --> 01:31:57,302
models was foraging. And there's a lot

1894
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,097
of interesting empirical and conceptual

1895
01:32:00,142 --> 01:32:02,792
reasons to think about foraging in terms

1896
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,625
of temporal and spatial depth of model.

1897
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:08,937
And that's true in the Vertebrates,

1898
01:32:09,287 --> 01:32:11,822
where they're discussing mainly, like,

1899
01:32:11,855 --> 01:32:15,407
hippocampus and entorhinal system and in

1900
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:17,657
the invertebrates that don't have a

1901
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,032
hippocampusentorhinyl system. But it's

1902
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:22,147
one reason why comparative neuroscience

1903
01:32:22,192 --> 01:32:24,677
is so important, because it prevents us

1904
01:32:24,695 --> 01:32:26,867
from getting fixed on specific

1905
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,852
anatomical realizations of given

1906
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:31,897
functional attributes of evolutionary

1907
01:32:31,942 --> 01:32:35,212
systems. Like, if the story of memory

1908
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:37,472
is just about some brain region in

1909
01:32:37,505 --> 01:32:41,327
humans, it may be a useful model.

1910
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:42,577
It's not even to say that it's

1911
01:32:42,607 --> 01:32:44,627
inaccurate. It's not even to say that

1912
01:32:44,645 --> 01:32:46,712
it's a partial model. It just is a model

1913
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:48,377
of that. Whereas if we want to

1914
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:51,227
understand a given cognitive function in

1915
01:32:51,245 --> 01:32:54,362
a broader context, we leave to pull back

1916
01:32:54,425 --> 01:32:58,322
somewhere a little bit beyond or in

1917
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,977
complement to the anatomy, because we

1918
01:33:00,995 --> 01:33:03,347
need the empirical anatomy to have

1919
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,325
anything specific to be talking about.

1920
01:33:05,762 --> 01:33:07,952
But it isn't just the case that

1921
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:10,142
vertebrate anatomy is the way to do

1922
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:13,547
active inference. Steven I think this is

1923
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:17,207
really helpful because it shows that the

1924
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:18,527
traps you were just mentioning there

1925
01:33:18,545 --> 01:33:21,442
that people we fall into is like humans

1926
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:25,067
have the frontal cortex. It's all about

1927
01:33:25,115 --> 01:33:27,197
this new what's, the new parts of the

1928
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:29,372
brain that are there. But we don't say

1929
01:33:29,405 --> 01:33:31,202
that with a Formula One car. We say,

1930
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:32,927
well, it's just got a primitive engine

1931
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,882
thing in there, and the rest of it's

1932
01:33:34,897 --> 01:33:37,022
evolved. It's like, well, that's itself

1933
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,467
different. And the same with the mark

1934
01:33:39,515 --> 01:33:41,262
Ines conversation.

1935
01:33:42,812 --> 01:33:45,907
The evolution of what's often dismissed

1936
01:33:45,922 --> 01:33:48,387
as the primitive parts of the brain.

1937
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:52,622
They themselves can have been more

1938
01:33:52,655 --> 01:33:54,272
sophisticated, though they're doing more

1939
01:33:54,305 --> 01:33:58,427
things, but they maybe

1940
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,307
help to be doing more than they were,

1941
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,600
as opposed to there's something else

1942
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:07,087
that is doing all the heavy lifting,

1943
01:34:07,162 --> 01:34:10,442
which I think is certainly a common

1944
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,412
misconception, I think, in psychology

1945
01:34:12,487 --> 01:34:15,917
anyway. Dean, can I read quickly

1946
01:34:15,965 --> 01:34:19,502
from the paper? Sure. The evolution of

1947
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,322
temporarily deep models from simpler

1948
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:23,042
models could be realized during

1949
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,897
evolution via the progressive keyword

1950
01:34:25,942 --> 01:34:28,927
here correlation of an initially

1951
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:32,467
differentiate model. So a relative

1952
01:34:32,527 --> 01:34:35,372
sense of invariance, ie. A model that

1953
01:34:35,405 --> 01:34:37,172
does not distinguish present from past

1954
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:39,427
and future into a model that features

1955
01:34:39,457 --> 01:34:40,967
separate latent states for the past,

1956
01:34:41,015 --> 01:34:43,727
present and future. This is the part I

1957
01:34:43,745 --> 01:34:45,347
loved. A key drive for this

1958
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:49,402
factorization or correlation

1959
01:34:49,582 --> 01:34:51,152
may have been the observation and

1960
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:53,777
progressive internalization of the

1961
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:57,302
sensor motor sequences sequentially that

1962
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,192
the animal creates and experiences while

1963
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,552
acting. While acting. In other words,

1964
01:35:02,645 --> 01:35:04,202
the self modeling of one's own

1965
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,902
sequential behavior patterns. See 53 for

1966
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,092
a computational example. I didn't open

1967
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,747
up 53. But again, if we want to talk

1968
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,952
about the polymath piece of this and the

1969
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,997
fact that our hex cells have to do some

1970
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:19,952
parcellization, it's right there in

1971
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:23,587
terms of sort of the next layer

1972
01:35:23,737 --> 01:35:26,072
on top of this as we move up through

1973
01:35:26,105 --> 01:35:29,117
that evolutionary cycle. Yeah.

1974
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:33,122
53 is Stoinove et al.

1975
01:35:33,155 --> 01:35:34,832
The hippocampal formation as a

1976
01:35:34,835 --> 01:35:36,202
hierarchical generative models

1977
01:35:36,232 --> 01:35:37,802
supporting generative replay and

1978
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:41,747
continual learning? There's a ton that

1979
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,082
could be said about that from like a

1980
01:35:43,085 --> 01:35:45,472
computational and a neuroanatomical

1981
01:35:45,592 --> 01:35:48,997
perspective. The internalization

1982
01:35:49,117 --> 01:35:51,772
of the sensory motor sequences relates

1983
01:35:51,817 --> 01:35:54,977
to the sensory motor detachment that we

1984
01:35:54,995 --> 01:35:57,067
talked about in the representation

1985
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:01,117
paper. So if some motor region

1986
01:36:01,177 --> 01:36:04,297
in the brain, if it's like a marionette

1987
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:07,582
and the fingers and then the motor plant

1988
01:36:07,747 --> 01:36:10,867
so that motor region has to be coupled

1989
01:36:10,927 --> 01:36:13,252
to the activity of that motor region,

1990
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:15,422
like either in a one directional way or

1991
01:36:15,455 --> 01:36:17,012
maybe even in a bi directional way,

1992
01:36:17,075 --> 01:36:20,927
let's just say. So that system as it

1993
01:36:20,945 --> 01:36:24,752
thinks, so it does, and vice versa, it

1994
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:27,452
cannot engage in counterfactuals because

1995
01:36:27,545 --> 01:36:31,037
any direction that the neural system

1996
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,442
turns, the motor system is just simply

1997
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,917
doing that. So it is not able to

1998
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:40,522
engage over evolution time in adaptive

1999
01:36:40,642 --> 01:36:43,412
action. The ones that do no longer

2000
01:36:43,475 --> 01:36:47,507
persist. It's always

2001
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:50,702
what ties it back to reality and to the

2002
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,422
finite amount of entities on the finite

2003
01:36:53,467 --> 01:36:55,552
spaceship Earth. Like Darwin's famous

2004
01:36:55,582 --> 01:36:56,852
calculation, like if the number of

2005
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:59,527
elephants slowly reproducing, they'll

2006
01:36:59,557 --> 01:37:02,422
cover the Earth unless their population

2007
01:37:02,467 --> 01:37:06,467
levels are kept in check. And so once

2008
01:37:06,515 --> 01:37:09,077
there's sensory motor detachment, so

2009
01:37:09,095 --> 01:37:11,552
there's some brain region, either a

2010
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:14,747
motor region or some supplemental area,

2011
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,927
some ancillary area that's able to

2012
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:19,777
intervene in that process or somehow

2013
01:37:19,807 --> 01:37:22,277
play a role that's detached from the

2014
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:25,172
motor activity. Now, there can be like a

2015
01:37:25,205 --> 01:37:28,367
motor planning occurring that

2016
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,577
opens up the affordance of temporal

2017
01:37:30,607 --> 01:37:33,122
depth or of counterfactuals all these

2018
01:37:33,155 --> 01:37:37,522
other cognition functions arising via

2019
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:40,800
the sensory motor detachment. And so

2020
01:37:43,262 --> 01:37:46,202
foraging is an awesome place to look at

2021
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:50,342
that for a lot of reasons in

2022
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:53,392
different life forms and computational

2023
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:55,157
foraging and so like, just a few of the

2024
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,122
notes were like what are the real

2025
01:37:57,155 --> 01:37:59,822
cognitive demands of foraging for

2026
01:37:59,855 --> 01:38:01,862
different creatures? And what about

2027
01:38:01,925 --> 01:38:04,507
internal foraging, like mental foraging?

2028
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,977
And these papers are very good.

2029
01:38:07,145 --> 01:38:09,152
Foraging in mind and foraging in

2030
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:13,062
semantic fields, both very useful,

2031
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:15,242
because they have to do with the way

2032
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:18,722
that they have some nice maths too,

2033
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:22,892
but they have to do with how

2034
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:25,922
actions that are spatial can have

2035
01:38:25,955 --> 01:38:28,847
conserved. Dynamics structurally. Just

2036
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,032
like we explore here to mental actions

2037
01:38:32,197 --> 01:38:33,662
and then we see them come together,

2038
01:38:33,725 --> 01:38:35,642
like with a memory palace or something

2039
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:39,362
like that. So foraging is cool.

2040
01:38:39,425 --> 01:38:42,427
It's good to study eleven endowed

2041
01:38:42,457 --> 01:38:43,867
generative models with hierarchical

2042
01:38:43,927 --> 01:38:46,502
depth of ours. Multiscale inference. We

2043
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,152
kind of addressed that earlier with the

2044
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:51,022
decades and years. Nested temporal

2045
01:38:51,067 --> 01:38:53,017
modeling is not the same as just deep

2046
01:38:53,077 --> 01:38:54,387
temporal modeling.

2047
01:38:58,487 --> 01:39:00,872
Another way to look at that is like how

2048
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,557
many operations you would need to get to

2049
01:39:03,635 --> 01:39:05,882
a hundred years. Well, if you're going

2050
01:39:05,885 --> 01:39:07,757
to do only temporal depth, it's going to

2051
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,102
take plus 100 or 99 time steps versus if

2052
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:14,987
it's one nesting and then

2053
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:17,327
ten on the higher order than ten on the

2054
01:39:17,345 --> 01:39:20,672
lower order. It was 21 operations. And

2055
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:24,997
so then there's shorter sequence

2056
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,772
of events to achieve a higher affordance

2057
01:39:27,817 --> 01:39:28,972
model, assuming that they're

2058
01:39:29,017 --> 01:39:30,012
appropriate.

2059
01:39:32,312 --> 01:39:36,047
Section twelve? Yeah, go ahead. Just one

2060
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,372
thing just on that model and it's also

2061
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,797
interesting thinking about how we think

2062
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:43,132
of time because indigenous approaches

2063
01:39:43,222 --> 01:39:45,797
tends to be Jelle as a cyclical time,

2064
01:39:45,905 --> 01:39:48,602
right? So things in the future will be a

2065
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:52,997
repeat of the cycle so the times

2066
01:39:53,105 --> 01:39:56,717
of thought of in a cyclic motion of the

2067
01:39:56,765 --> 01:39:58,877
sort of passing of the day, passing of

2068
01:39:58,895 --> 01:40:02,492
the and of course we have

2069
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:05,550
this assumptions of time stretching out.

2070
01:40:05,987 --> 01:40:09,692
So is it that we will over

2071
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:13,322
time, what will things be like in

2072
01:40:13,355 --> 01:40:14,412
four generations?

2073
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:20,452
And if my world and my biology follows

2074
01:40:20,482 --> 01:40:22,327
certain cyclical patterns and it's

2075
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:24,077
fairly stable, maybe that's quite a good

2076
01:40:24,095 --> 01:40:25,500
way to think about,

2077
01:40:27,137 --> 01:40:29,552
say, Kant the tree now to help the

2078
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:34,322
people in 150 years. So it

2079
01:40:34,355 --> 01:40:36,737
sort of comes back to the different ways

2080
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,397
to construct how we think

2081
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:41,400
about time.

2082
01:40:44,687 --> 01:40:48,332
Cool. So Twelve looks into

2083
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:51,527
a phylogenetic tree of the evolution of

2084
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:55,022
generative models so what

2085
01:40:55,055 --> 01:40:57,677
is a phylogenetic tree and what's the

2086
01:40:57,695 --> 01:40:59,767
relationship between active inference,

2087
01:40:59,902 --> 01:41:03,647
FEP and evolution? Well, we'll have more

2088
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,467
to share in the coming papers, as always

2089
01:41:06,515 --> 01:41:08,842
but how do they address it specifically

2090
01:41:08,902 --> 01:41:13,877
here in figure five they

2091
01:41:14,045 --> 01:41:16,367
map on we'll root the tree so

2092
01:41:16,415 --> 01:41:18,607
technically, as shown right here, it's

2093
01:41:18,622 --> 01:41:20,132
an unrooted tree. There is an

2094
01:41:20,135 --> 01:41:22,547
implication routing here but it's a very

2095
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,727
interesting feature of phylogenetics

2096
01:41:24,757 --> 01:41:27,092
that few outside of the field know about

2097
01:41:27,215 --> 01:41:29,942
that computationally the tree is often

2098
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:34,067
inferred in an unrooted fashion like by

2099
01:41:34,265 --> 01:41:35,777
clustering the ones that are close and

2100
01:41:35,795 --> 01:41:37,512
finding the relationships, et cetera.

2101
01:41:37,862 --> 01:41:41,597
However, that is leaving an

2102
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:44,477
ambiguity as to where the root of the

2103
01:41:44,495 --> 01:41:47,927
tree is. So like for example, if this is

2104
01:41:47,945 --> 01:41:51,422
the overall connectivity based

2105
01:41:51,455 --> 01:41:53,252
upon the phylogenetic inference, this is

2106
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,877
what the tree topology has been inferred

2107
01:41:54,907 --> 01:41:57,152
to look like and somebody might say,

2108
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,622
well, it looks like this one, the red

2109
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:00,497
one and then the green one below it.

2110
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,622
They are, they're clearly very closely

2111
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:06,887
related but actually if the root comes

2112
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:10,552
in here then that's

2113
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:13,147
not necessarily the case. So the rooting

2114
01:42:13,192 --> 01:42:16,382
of a phylogenetic tree is very important

2115
01:42:16,535 --> 01:42:19,042
and a tree that's rooted inappropriately

2116
01:42:19,102 --> 01:42:21,577
or has an inappropriate group selection

2117
01:42:21,757 --> 01:42:25,357
is just it's worse than illegible

2118
01:42:25,447 --> 01:42:27,152
because it's highly legible and it can

2119
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:29,402
have a high statistical confidence but

2120
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,447
it can have an absolutely nonbiological

2121
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:33,832
topology. But assuming that they meant

2122
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:35,475
the tree to be rooted here,

2123
01:42:36,962 --> 01:42:40,702
here the branches are where there's

2124
01:42:40,732 --> 01:42:42,382
going to be different operators

2125
01:42:42,472 --> 01:42:44,812
occurring encoding the eye identity,

2126
01:42:44,887 --> 01:42:48,497
unchanging one and then the

2127
01:42:48,605 --> 01:42:51,637
edges reflect like bifurcations

2128
01:42:51,787 --> 01:42:54,302
expectation events. So here there's an

2129
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:57,697
ancestral homeostat and then the lineage

2130
01:42:57,742 --> 01:43:00,902
leading to orange did not go undergo any

2131
01:43:00,995 --> 01:43:03,977
changes that were nonconservative on the

2132
01:43:03,995 --> 01:43:06,712
branch leading to these sister species.

2133
01:43:06,862 --> 01:43:09,452
There was a duplication and then it

2134
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:11,177
stayed the same and stayed the same and

2135
01:43:11,195 --> 01:43:13,217
then the purple node is going to have

2136
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:16,132
two duplicated homeostas and so they're

2137
01:43:16,147 --> 01:43:19,052
just overlying evolutionary algebra the

2138
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:22,432
steps that they gave on to the topology

2139
01:43:22,522 --> 01:43:25,875
of speciation. And so that

2140
01:43:26,537 --> 01:43:30,277
as they discuss opens

2141
01:43:30,307 --> 01:43:32,237
up a way to think from this sort of

2142
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:34,502
graphical functional perspective which

2143
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,622
is compatible with active to think about

2144
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:41,025
how, for example, from the species today

2145
01:43:41,387 --> 01:43:44,222
we could infer some of the schema of the

2146
01:43:44,255 --> 01:43:46,217
early vertebrate brain with the early

2147
01:43:46,265 --> 01:43:48,832
primate brain or push it back further.

2148
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,432
What about the common ancestors of the

2149
01:43:50,435 --> 01:43:52,922
vertebrates and the invertebrates and

2150
01:43:52,955 --> 01:43:54,157
all these other questions but that's

2151
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:57,377
kind of what they lay out here. These

2152
01:43:57,395 --> 01:43:59,647
are familiar models to evolutionary

2153
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:03,697
biologists like phylogenetic

2154
01:44:03,817 --> 01:44:05,852
ancestral state reconstructions of

2155
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:09,077
phenotype which are often even done in a

2156
01:44:09,095 --> 01:44:11,272
Bayesian way. Like there's an algorithm

2157
01:44:11,317 --> 01:44:14,617
beast Bayesian estimation of ancestral

2158
01:44:14,677 --> 01:44:18,237
states. This is also a Bayesian

2159
01:44:19,037 --> 01:44:20,927
model that allows us to do

2160
01:44:20,945 --> 01:44:22,532
reconstruction of ancestral states but

2161
01:44:22,535 --> 01:44:24,907
it's in a very different way than it's

2162
01:44:24,922 --> 01:44:26,437
been approached outside of the active

2163
01:44:26,512 --> 01:44:30,422
world. But that's figure five and

2164
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:32,737
that's where we see the evolutionary

2165
01:44:32,812 --> 01:44:36,375
algebra, the design patterns or the

2166
01:44:36,962 --> 01:44:40,772
pattern language for structural changes

2167
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,447
in generative models super imposed on

2168
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:46,402
species relatedness in a phylogenic

2169
01:44:46,432 --> 01:44:47,112
tree.

2170
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:57,627
Any thoughts on five? I tried to convert

2171
01:44:57,657 --> 01:45:01,002
this and reapply it to my picking

2172
01:45:01,032 --> 01:45:03,577
of teams in the March Madness table and

2173
01:45:03,595 --> 01:45:06,512
I wasn't able to take philosophenetic

2174
01:45:06,862 --> 01:45:09,267
trees and convert them into winning

2175
01:45:09,327 --> 01:45:11,347
thousands of dollars on betting on

2176
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:14,017
college basketball. So despite my best

2177
01:45:14,065 --> 01:45:17,917
efforts, it's kind of contained for

2178
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:21,852
what it represents dot. Two foreshadow

2179
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:23,992
too hard, but I think live stream number

2180
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,952
39 and 40 might constitute March

2181
01:45:26,982 --> 01:45:31,227
Madness. And then also here's

2182
01:45:31,257 --> 01:45:33,950
another for those who watch.

2183
01:45:34,762 --> 01:45:37,507
Okay, here now we have a little bit of a

2184
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:39,142
March Madness bracket going, don't we?

2185
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:42,442
Here's bracketology. That is so

2186
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,932
fantastic. So here we go.

2187
01:45:45,085 --> 01:45:48,492
Yeah, now here the root

2188
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:51,552
could have been here and then here's

2189
01:45:51,582 --> 01:45:53,842
like two big species clades, like two

2190
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,177
like this is like vertebrates and

2191
01:45:55,195 --> 01:45:56,377
invertebrates and then there's some

2192
01:45:56,395 --> 01:45:59,502
rooted clade. Wow. So that's

2193
01:45:59,532 --> 01:46:01,122
like why it's important to root the tree

2194
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:03,262
because here it looks like all of these

2195
01:46:03,325 --> 01:46:04,822
are a sister to each other at the

2196
01:46:04,855 --> 01:46:07,027
exclusion of this one. But then if we

2197
01:46:07,045 --> 01:46:10,325
were to have rooted that tree like here,

2198
01:46:11,362 --> 01:46:14,122
then actually this is a small sister out

2199
01:46:14,155 --> 01:46:17,602
group to all of these and so

2200
01:46:17,695 --> 01:46:20,782
the rooting and the contextualizing is

2201
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:23,302
really important. It's super interesting

2202
01:46:23,395 --> 01:46:25,822
because it seems like you put in so much

2203
01:46:25,855 --> 01:46:27,457
data into these phylogenetic models and

2204
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:29,347
it seems like literally how could this

2205
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:32,197
not converge on a super obvious answer?

2206
01:46:32,305 --> 01:46:35,482
I mean, isn't it clear how these answer

2207
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,947
related to each other phylogenetically?

2208
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:39,552
But then there's a little bit of nuance

2209
01:46:39,582 --> 01:46:41,237
that enters the picture. Steven.

2210
01:46:43,312 --> 01:46:46,317
Yeah, I was curious that the allostasis

2211
01:46:46,377 --> 01:46:49,937
can recombine with the homeostatic

2212
01:46:50,662 --> 01:46:52,937
to give a base level temporal.

2213
01:46:56,437 --> 01:47:00,437
It doesn't deflate back to just staying

2214
01:47:01,762 --> 01:47:03,802
allostasis I suppose they would be they

2215
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:09,472
just don't show that it

2216
01:47:09,505 --> 01:47:10,677
did that. I suppose you just wouldn't

2217
01:47:10,707 --> 01:47:14,407
talk about it when it

2218
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:17,647
goes to a and then it goes AI goes to

2219
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,752
HT so th yeah,

2220
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:23,572
so we have a. Homeostat here we have two

2221
01:47:23,605 --> 01:47:26,767
homeostats, two homeostats and now here

2222
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,262
we have one homeostat and one allostasis

2223
01:47:29,337 --> 01:47:31,037
in this Bleu node.

2224
01:47:35,137 --> 01:47:37,807
But they're just kind of giving general

2225
01:47:37,885 --> 01:47:39,397
examples like it would have been cool to

2226
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:42,950
see this is where we're talking about

2227
01:47:44,737 --> 01:47:47,622
mammals and here's non mammal

2228
01:47:47,667 --> 01:47:49,747
vertebrates. Like here is a specific

2229
01:47:49,855 --> 01:47:53,392
brain region and also that is in this

2230
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:56,600
Chakraborte and Jarvis 2015 paper.

2231
01:47:57,937 --> 01:48:01,072
This paper gets more

2232
01:48:01,105 --> 01:48:03,202
into the nuances of neuroanatomy and

2233
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:07,197
neurogenetics and how like implication

2234
01:48:07,392 --> 01:48:11,367
in brain regions

2235
01:48:11,427 --> 01:48:13,692
can be underpinned by developmental

2236
01:48:13,752 --> 01:48:16,717
neurogenetic changes. And they do link

2237
01:48:16,765 --> 01:48:18,397
that a little bit more closely, like to

2238
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:22,267
studying the bird brain and the song and

2239
01:48:22,315 --> 01:48:25,262
motor system in parrots,

2240
01:48:25,687 --> 01:48:27,802
which is also cool because Birdsong has

2241
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:29,782
been studied with active. So there could

2242
01:48:29,785 --> 01:48:33,125
be a nice building upon this

2243
01:48:33,487 --> 01:48:36,500
work and connecting it to some of the

2244
01:48:38,587 --> 01:48:41,467
structure fitting in figure five.

2245
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:43,707
So it COVID almost be like you got parts

2246
01:48:43,722 --> 01:48:47,727
of the brain which are more allostasis

2247
01:48:47,757 --> 01:48:50,750
orientated or homeostatic orientated and

2248
01:48:51,112 --> 01:48:54,592
that so in a way by the structuring of

2249
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:58,132
that gives some sort of differentiate in

2250
01:48:58,135 --> 01:49:00,682
terms of how information and control

2251
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,442
would be carried out. Yeah,

2252
01:49:03,565 --> 01:49:06,937
totally extending temporal depth within

2253
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,027
a model. It's like a brain region

2254
01:49:09,057 --> 01:49:10,732
getting a little bigger, let's just say

2255
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:12,397
not that size is correlated with

2256
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:14,227
function in that specific way but then

2257
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,072
duplicating brain regions is like

2258
01:49:16,105 --> 01:49:19,552
duplicating laterally or nesting of

2259
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:21,772
brain regions. It's hierarchical. Think

2260
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:24,837
about how the eyes developed the insect

2261
01:49:24,912 --> 01:49:29,922
eye, it has a relatively simple module

2262
01:49:30,117 --> 01:49:32,692
but then insect eyes can change in size

2263
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:35,187
over evolutionary time very radically

2264
01:49:35,262 --> 01:49:38,197
from like taking up half of the head to

2265
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,997
being just one photoreceptor or even

2266
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:44,052
being lost because they're existing

2267
01:49:44,157 --> 01:49:47,612
in more of a duplicable motif.

2268
01:49:47,962 --> 01:49:51,102
Whereas the binocular eye

2269
01:49:51,132 --> 01:49:53,827
system that mammals have, it's not as

2270
01:49:53,845 --> 01:49:56,017
amenable to like just doubling into four

2271
01:49:56,065 --> 01:49:59,527
eyes or splitting into two in

2272
01:49:59,545 --> 01:50:00,667
the middles or something like that,

2273
01:50:00,715 --> 01:50:02,827
whereas the insect compound eye has some

2274
01:50:02,845 --> 01:50:06,322
of those evolutionary affordances. So

2275
01:50:06,355 --> 01:50:08,947
then understanding like parameter change

2276
01:50:09,055 --> 01:50:11,547
within a model and then structure

2277
01:50:11,592 --> 01:50:14,647
learning on populations of models and

2278
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,012
what are the mutational adjacencies.

2279
01:50:18,037 --> 01:50:20,877
There are so many awesome areas and it's

2280
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:22,702
like truly just beginning for

2281
01:50:22,795 --> 01:50:26,122
evolutionary bio active states. Yeah,

2282
01:50:26,155 --> 01:50:27,847
it was really helpful. Having someone

2283
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,042
like yourself who's got that background

2284
01:50:30,177 --> 01:50:31,872
to go through. That is quite helpful

2285
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:35,272
because it's a little

2286
01:50:35,305 --> 01:50:37,942
bit intimidating, actually, at first

2287
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:40,475
sight seeing this for me,

2288
01:50:40,912 --> 01:50:42,802
I see the logic, what you're saying.

2289
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,617
It's quite exciting actually seeing

2290
01:50:44,665 --> 01:50:46,252
that. Again, one of the things this

2291
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:49,925
paper does is it's time threads together

2292
01:50:51,712 --> 01:50:55,925
which seem very distant almost

2293
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:59,602
in traditional terms, like Jelle. I

2294
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:01,327
don't like using the word kamikaze, but

2295
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:04,552
it's a little bit like yeah, it's a

2296
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:07,250
bit of overwhelming often. So I think

2297
01:51:08,587 --> 01:51:10,252
but of course, that's the beauty of

2298
01:51:10,345 --> 01:51:12,222
active is it has that unifying

2299
01:51:12,267 --> 01:51:15,772
potential. So thanks. Cool. Yeah,

2300
01:51:15,805 --> 01:51:17,707
thank you. I agree. There's some

2301
01:51:17,785 --> 01:51:21,252
labeling. This is rarely included unless

2302
01:51:21,282 --> 01:51:23,202
it's a time calibrated phylogenetic

2303
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:25,852
tree, but like, we're looking at the

2304
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:29,062
passage of time, but that's not even

2305
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:32,622
always shown. Yes, Dean,

2306
01:51:32,667 --> 01:51:34,777
we'll have our final thought. Can you

2307
01:51:34,795 --> 01:51:37,152
just go back to that? Because I didn't

2308
01:51:37,182 --> 01:51:38,527
prompt you to put that up there. But I

2309
01:51:38,545 --> 01:51:41,722
really like that because at some point

2310
01:51:41,755 --> 01:51:43,897
we're going to have to in point to talk

2311
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:46,927
about that sort of basal gating part of

2312
01:51:46,945 --> 01:51:50,075
this. And most things that are

2313
01:51:50,962 --> 01:51:53,722
organized as if then causality. But you

2314
01:51:53,755 --> 01:51:57,177
just said it. It's then if go or don't

2315
01:51:57,207 --> 01:52:00,950
go is very dependent on then before

2316
01:52:01,612 --> 01:52:03,952
we choose to go or don't go. Right. Go

2317
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,477
or don't go is still held open until one

2318
01:52:07,495 --> 01:52:11,377
of the others decided. So another thank

2319
01:52:11,395 --> 01:52:14,450
you for that because the point too.

2320
01:52:15,337 --> 01:52:17,017
We should maybe talk a little bit about

2321
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:17,675
that.

2322
01:52:21,787 --> 01:52:24,277
Cool. Yeah. There's so many ways to

2323
01:52:24,295 --> 01:52:26,142
think about like this garden of forking

2324
01:52:26,202 --> 01:52:29,797
paths, branching paths, how that

2325
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:31,902
relates to parameter updating, Bayesian

2326
01:52:31,932 --> 01:52:33,875
belief updating and structured learning.

2327
01:52:34,387 --> 01:52:36,112
What about when the structure of a model

2328
01:52:36,175 --> 01:52:39,322
is a parameter in a nested model? So

2329
01:52:39,355 --> 01:52:41,422
then that sort of blurs the line. From

2330
01:52:41,455 --> 01:52:43,072
the bottom looking up, it looks like

2331
01:52:43,105 --> 01:52:44,902
structured learning, but then from the

2332
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,297
top looking down, it looks like

2333
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:49,747
parameter fitting. Right. And if only we

2334
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,522
had like some mathematics to describe

2335
01:52:51,567 --> 01:52:52,175
that.

2336
01:52:56,062 --> 01:52:59,452
Okay, any final thoughts or what

2337
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:01,192
are we excited about for the dot two to

2338
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:04,850
next week? Well, my last thought

2339
01:53:05,212 --> 01:53:07,747
is yeah, I'm excited to keep this going

2340
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,027
because I think it's got a lot of legs

2341
01:53:09,057 --> 01:53:11,752
to it. I think one thing that comes to

2342
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:14,837
mind as well with all this progressively

2343
01:53:15,487 --> 01:53:17,967
increased temporal and hierarchical

2344
01:53:18,027 --> 01:53:20,827
depth, is maybe where some of the more

2345
01:53:20,845 --> 01:53:23,497
basic elements still have a really

2346
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:26,352
useful part to play is what Mike Levin

2347
01:53:26,382 --> 01:53:29,152
said about when do we stop? So we got

2348
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:30,637
all these ways where we can start to

2349
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:32,227
okay, so we got all these ways that we

2350
01:53:32,245 --> 01:53:34,267
can think, how do we know when to stop

2351
01:53:34,315 --> 01:53:36,727
and to sit down? And maybe in the

2352
01:53:36,745 --> 01:53:38,617
ultimate ways when our tummy maybe

2353
01:53:38,665 --> 01:53:40,702
that's where the gut is so useful. Like

2354
01:53:40,795 --> 01:53:42,397
at the end of the day, the brain can go

2355
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:43,957
running off and maybe the gut and the

2356
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,052
heart needs to say, okay, sit down,

2357
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:51,457
get some food. I'm going to get a

2358
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:53,602
drink of honey now, but I'll bid you

2359
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:55,272
feel well. Thank you for a great dark

2360
01:53:55,317 --> 01:53:57,927
time, but I'll hear your last thoughts

2361
01:53:57,957 --> 01:53:58,625
as well.

2362
01:54:01,725 --> 01:54:05,115
Dean, I hate having the

2363
01:54:05,132 --> 01:54:07,400
last word, so maybe you'll have a dory

2364
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:09,560
you'll have it? And I just appreciate

2365
01:54:09,605 --> 01:54:11,940
Klaas. Stephan just said because I think

2366
01:54:11,957 --> 01:54:13,925
that that's a big part in this ability

2367
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,635
to go from word back into the

2368
01:54:16,742 --> 01:54:19,665
phenomenological space. And I think

2369
01:54:19,682 --> 01:54:22,185
there are other brains that we know of

2370
01:54:22,217 --> 01:54:24,765
now that play a significant role in

2371
01:54:24,782 --> 01:54:27,290
that, not just the one that turns

2372
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,750
everything Hinton, symbols.

2373
01:54:30,075 --> 01:54:33,330
Great. My last thought is there's no

2374
01:54:33,377 --> 01:54:35,265
better drink after a foraging trip than

2375
01:54:35,282 --> 01:54:35,950
honey.

2376
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:42,540
Alright, thank you and talk to you

2377
01:54:42,557 --> 01:54:43,137
later.
