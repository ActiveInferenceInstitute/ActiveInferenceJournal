00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,547
Hello and welcome everyone. It's ActInf

2
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:34,602
Lab livestream number 38.0,

3
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,422
February 10, 2022.

4
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,237
We're going to be discussing the paper.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,547
"The evolution of brain architectures for

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,352
prediction, active coding and active

7
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:46,457
inference." Welcome to the Active

8
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:49,022
Inference Lab. We are a participatory

9
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,882
online lab that is communicating,

10
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,027
learning and practicing applied active

11
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,032
inference. You can find us at some of

12
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:57,552
the links here on the slide. This is a

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,042
recorded and archived livestream, so

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,632
please provide us with feedback so we

15
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:04,427
can improve on our work. All backgrounds

16
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:06,717
and perspectives are welcome here and

17
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:08,252
we'll be following good video etiquette

18
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,702
for live streams. It's going to be a

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,777
solo stream though. Go 

20
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,997
ActiveInference.org if you want to learn more

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,177
about how to participate or contribute

22
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,067
or get involved with any active project

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,167
and check out this code, a link to see

24
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,687
past and encoding live streams. The page

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,182
looks like this so you can see events

26
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:29,592
that haven't happened yet, like 39,

27
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,652
40. And then also you can look back and

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,227
you can see who is participating and

29
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,657
read the papers and all of that. So

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,162
check it out today in active stream

31
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,227
number 38. The goal is to learn and

32
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,272
discuss this cool paper, the Evolution

33
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:47,027
of Brain Architectures for Predictive

34
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:50,177
Coding and Active Inference. The papers

35
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:53,112
by Giovanni Pezzulo, Thomas Parr and

36
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,652
Karl Friston from December 21. And just

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,902
like all videos, it's just an

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,677
introduction to some of the ideas. It's

39
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:03,447
not a review or a final word. So go

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,147
check out the paper to learn more. And

41
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:09,025
there's going to be an overview with

42
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:11,697
first names and claims, abstract and

43
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,427
roadmap. Alright? I'm Daniel, I'm a

44
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:17,877
researcher in California. The big

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,292
question that this paper is getting at

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,922
is what is the evolutionary

47
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:25,817
neurophysiological basis of cognition

48
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:28,352
and how do complex cognitive phenotypes

49
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,902
arise? So how do things develop

50
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:35,247
and evolve, how they think and how does

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,142
that change over evolutionary time? And

52
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,622
shown here are three images representing

53
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,032
three scales of analysis of looking at

54
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,392
ant cognition. So on the left is a

55
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,627
representation of the synapse with the

56
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:51,227
glia wrapped around it and the molecules

57
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,707
and some of the mechanisms, because

58
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,597
changes in those mechanisms can

59
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,912
influence cognition. Then in the middle

60
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:00,392
is a 3D representation of an ant brain

61
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:02,742
with the different brain regions like

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,852
the central complex and the optic

63
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,397
and the olfactory lobes. And this

64
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,202
represents the level of regional or

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,242
micro or meso anatomical variation.

66
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:16,722
And that definitely changes over

67
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,057
evolutionary time, just like the

68
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,592
synaptic level. And then there's this

69
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,552
behavior ecological level and that's

70
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:24,927
where the ants are engaging in

71
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,925
collective behavior and stigma g. And so

72
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:31,152
how does this all work? How does this

73
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,252
all work in today's ants and how has it

74
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,057
evolved and then expand that to other

75
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,200
species and other questions?

76
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,522
The paper was published right at the end

77
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,362
of 2021 in December in

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,762
the Royal Society of Publishing.

79
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,607
And just to go over the aims and claims

80
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,647
of the paper, this is in the authors

81
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,177
words, there's growing consensus that

82
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,632
the brains of humans in other

83
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,022
phylogenetically derived or advanced

84
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,467
organisms operate in a predictive manner

85
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:07,617
across action prediction coding and

86
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,752
action control active inference. Yet the

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,467
ways in which our advanced predictive

88
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,067
abilities may have arisen during

89
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:17,052
evolution domain unclear. The goal of

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,477
this article is to sketch an

91
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,072
evolutionary history of brain

92
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,722
architecture's for predictive

93
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,272
processing. A central tenet of

94
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:27,722
our proposal is that although prediction

95
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,942
is often characterized as a complex

96
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,967
cognitive function, it is not a late

97
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,322
evolution addition of advanced animals

98
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,827
like us. Rather, in distinctions to a

99
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,552
late stage cognitive argument like

100
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,277
saying language is what makes us an

101
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:44,567
advanced cognizer or semantic language

102
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:47,147
with certain types of syntax.

103
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,397
Rather, our complex predictive

104
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,937
abilities, eg. Learning and imagination

105
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,592
emerged gradually e. G via phyletic

106
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:58,397
gradualism smooth changes to evolution

107
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:02,522
time or punctuated equilibrium sharp

108
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,557
changes through evolution time. But

109
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,552
punctuated at one scale is smooth at

110
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,982
another from simpler predictive and

111
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,417
errors correction loops e. G, motor and

112
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,012
autonomic reflexes that were already

113
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:16,697
part of the brains of our earlier

114
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,972
evolutionary ancestors and were key to

115
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,250
solving adaptive regulation problems.

116
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,977
So, just like Mike Levin's

117
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,652
paper was addressing the question of

118
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,472
basal cognition from the bioelectric

119
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:30,777
perspective, here is going to be more of

120
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,642
a predictive processing and action

121
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,847
inference perspective on the functional

122
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,647
aspects, not on the mechanistic. So the

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,447
bioelectric was down here at the level

124
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,277
of cells. This is going to be

125
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,957
approaching it from a little bit of a

126
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,247
different perspective, but we'll find

127
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,522
out here's the Abstract this

128
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,522
article considers the evolution of brain

129
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,817
architectures for predictive processing.

130
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,897
We argue that brain mechanisms for

131
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,477
predictive exteroception and action are

132
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,127
not Laje evolutionary additions of

133
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,112
advanced creatures like us. Rather,

134
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,977
they emerge gradually from simpler

135
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:06,152
predictive loops for example, autonomic

136
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,177
and motor reflexes that were a legacy

137
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,087
from our earlier evolutionary ancestors

138
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,822
and were key to solving their

139
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:14,672
fundamental problems of adaptive

140
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:18,047
regulation. We characterize simpler

141
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,322
to more complex brains formerly in terms

142
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,902
of generative models that include

143
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:23,537
predictive loops of increasing

144
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,742
hierarchical breadth and depth. These

145
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,502
may start from a simple homeostatic

146
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:31,067
motif and be elaborated during evolution

147
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:34,302
in four main ways. These include the

148
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,197
multimodal expansion of predictive

149
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,672
control into an allostatic loop, its

150
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,897
duplication to form multiple sensory

151
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,327
motor loops that expand an animal's

152
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:47,672
behavior repertoire and the gradual

153
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,407
endowment of general, generative model

154
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,047
models with hierarchical depth to deal.

155
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,922
With aspects of the world to unfold at

156
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,952
different spatial scales and temporal

157
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,317
depth, to select which plans select

158
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,337
plans in a future oriented manner.

159
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,482
In turn, these elaborations underwrite

160
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,372
the solution to biological regulation

161
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,827
problems faced by increasingly

162
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,467
sophisticated animals. Our proposal

163
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,147
aligns neuroscientific theorizing about

164
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,297
predictive processing with evolutionary

165
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,722
and comparative data on brain

166
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,372
architecture's in different animal

167
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,682
species. And just looking ahead, here's

168
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:21,297
a figure that we're going to get to

169
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,847
here's. The interface states it has this

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,057
structure to model and then it's going

171
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,127
to undergo a set of different types of

172
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:30,852
discrete operations that change it

173
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,222
structurally and that's structured

174
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,522
learning. And it's going to happen over

175
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,082
evolution time scale and it's going to

176
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,302
be tied to functional architectures for

177
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,677
predictive processing. Okay, how do they

178
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,377
go from here to there? This is the

179
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:46,347
roadmap after the interoception. They

180
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,072
introduce predictive regulation and

181
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,022
control perception, cognition and

182
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,242
control action as basic design

183
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,877
principles of the brain. So kind of

184
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:56,217
taking that embodied approach but making

185
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,527
it very operational and functional so

186
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,577
that it can be studied from brain

187
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,687
evolution function perspective.

188
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:05,222
Introducing the brain as doing structure

189
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,332
learning in generative model models over

190
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,777
evolutionary and also other active

191
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,067
states. They then give three examples

192
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,022
of simple predictive motifs in ancestral

193
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,357
brains which is the homeostatic control,

194
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:21,147
the allostasis control and the simple

195
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:24,602
behavior learning. Then they introduce

196
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,952
that figure that we just looked at and

197
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,097
that's the evolutionary algebra of

198
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,762
structured learning. Just like you can

199
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,462
multiply and add these are kind of like

200
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:37,047
operations on evolutionary spaces. They

201
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,622
then discuss a few finer points related

202
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,542
to behavior switching, temporal depth,

203
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:45,012
hierarchical depth and then take a

204
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,842
phylogenetic perspective at the end

205
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,807
given an example and there's a

206
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,100
discussion. Okay,

207
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,302
so to go into section two and just sort

208
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,747
of deal with the keywords and themes as

209
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,325
they are needed,

210
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:04,572
here's figure one. In.

211
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,957
Figure one. The reason why we can even

212
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,937
jump in here without going to any

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,227
keywords is it's biology we're

214
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:14,172
talking about? And we can jump in. Why

215
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,452
not as good of a place as any to go in

216
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,072
at the action perception loop and then

217
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,052
connect it to some of the analytical or

218
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,607
mathematical formalisms of active

219
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,347
inference and the free energy principle.

220
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,352
So this is figure one in the paper in

221
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,547
section two, the Action exteroception

222
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:31,422
cycle and Predictive regulation. So

223
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,852
here's our entity, our agent on the left

224
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,347
and here is our world state on the

225
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,757
right. The entity is engaged

226
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,557
in prediction while they're making

227
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,717
observations that are being emitted from

228
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,817
the world that's resulting in some

229
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:50,097
discrepancy. Either things are exactly

230
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,827
as expected or not. So an example would

231
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:56,247
be in the visual field. The brain is

232
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,647
generating a prediction of what is in

233
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,167
the blind spot of the retina. And then

234
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:03,417
if the eyes were to move there, to use

235
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,357
action changing the world in terms of

236
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,597
the stimuli coming in through ocular

237
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,532
motor action that would result in a

238
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,602
exafferent perception that could either

239
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:17,052
confirm or deny. Confirm with a low

240
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,932
discrepancy or be very surprising with a

241
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,397
high discrepancy. What was expected

242
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,877
about what was in the blind spot which

243
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:25,622
would confirm accuracy in a visual

244
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,902
model. And so in this partitioning of

245
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,897
action and perception, which is just

246
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,577
very descriptive, it's not quite the

247
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:33,927
Bayesian graph that we're going to get

248
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,732
to later. It's kind of like a flow model

249
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,402
and there's probably other flow models

250
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,607
that could be used as well. But it turns

251
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,627
out that this partitioning, or this way

252
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,247
of thinking about flow, at least

253
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,727
conceptually, leads to in the active

254
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,782
inference proposal, this idea

255
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,892
of using a free energy minimizing

256
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,827
function over some math that we'll get

257
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,402
to a little bit more formally in the

258
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,392
next figure and using a kind of combined

259
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,397
metric that has two parts, the red and

260
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,937
the Bleu, to make decisions about

261
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:08,652
perception as well as action. Because it

262
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,187
turns out that perception and action and

263
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,602
cognition and metacognition are all part

264
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,867
of the entity's model that it's doing

265
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:19,227
inference on in certain cases. So just

266
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,242
to kind of throw back to not so long

267
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,187
ago, here we have the F of

268
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,022
Q, that's the distribution that's under

269
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,127
the entity's control and Y. And so as a

270
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,457
function of beliefs and data, there's

271
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,077
going to be some term. And so just

272
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,882
looking back to 37, we looked at the

273
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,762
variational free energy and how that

274
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:46,032
relates to perceptual inference where

275
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,672
there's a penalty for overfitting as

276
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,412
well as a penalty for failing to explain

277
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,842
the data. So it's kind of making a

278
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,127
visual model or a perceptual model that

279
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:58,152
in that snapshot given the priors and

280
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,927
precision and all of that is not

281
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,742
overfitting, but it is fitting the data

282
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,002
and it's kind of existing on that

283
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,152
frontier and then it's using variational

284
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,872
inference to solve that in a really

285
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:11,027
tractable way. And then when action

286
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:13,137
comes Hinton play, a few things happen.

287
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,072
First the agent has to incorporate their

288
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:17,562
own preferences because why care about

289
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,832
action if you don't even care why it's

290
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:21,327
going to happen? So they have to

291
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:22,827
incorporate their preferences, which is

292
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:25,922
a non arbitrary in a sense for action

293
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,002
selection, but it's arbitrary in a

294
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,922
higher level as well as incorporating

295
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,972
the fact that there's uncertainty over

296
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,072
the consequences of action or just

297
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,602
future states of the world, not just

298
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,222
like sensor measurement as in other

299
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,442
cases. So we have to take this

300
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,947
variational free energy calculation that

301
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,047
was just like snapshot perception and

302
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,122
expand it a little bit to the expected

303
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,977
free energy. So here's F in the

304
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,127
background and now there's this expected

305
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:55,887
free energy term G, which is over also

306
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,712
an action selection policy z. And now

307
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,342
there's kind of similar like resonating

308
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:05,322
or Rhyming terms. But rather than

309
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,922
overfitting, the imperative on the left

310
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,552
side is to satisfy preferences on

311
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,552
the right side. The penalty for failing

312
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,647
to explain the data is kind of

313
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,147
transposed into this failing to minimize

314
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,722
expected surprise of future data. So

315
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:24,437
this is like fitting the expectations

316
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,147
well on the right side in Bleu and then

317
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,752
living up to your preferences and

318
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,422
expectations in an optimistic way on the

319
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,432
left. So it's kind of like realism on

320
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,775
the right and optimism on the left. And

321
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,522
that is what we talked about in 37 and

322
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:40,947
that's the partitioning that's being

323
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,527
done basically here. The authors are

324
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:46,097
setting that up as the action perception

325
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:48,447
cycle and predictive regulation. Just

326
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,847
wanted to kind of view 37 really quick

327
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,572
because it was a fun discussion that we

328
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,647
had. It also really sets the stage for?

329
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,227
How is that similar or different than

330
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,107
other action perception partitionings or

331
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:04,242
models? Does evolutionary psychology or

332
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,492
evolutionary cognition studies, do they

333
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,707
have a fundamental action perception

334
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:13,452
model at the root? Is that a good thing?

335
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,875
Is it a bad thing?

336
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,577
Section three goes into section two.

337
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,842
Gain was just about how this single

338
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,867
slide and represented in figure one

339
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:27,962
about this predictive. So anticipatory

340
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,607
but also embedded etc. Infinity loop

341
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:34,902
cycle is the basic principle of the

342
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,527
brain. We can't take the basic principle

343
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:39,492
of the brain to be some lower level like

344
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,372
just information transmission among

345
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,307
cells. Nor do the authors jump in at a

346
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,127
higher level like the fundamental unit

347
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,402
of cognition is linguistic tokens that

348
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,167
are being modified, not discrepancies

349
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:54,752
with multiple different kinds

350
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:57,972
of things that are being predicted from

351
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,397
this functional description of

352
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,027
cognition. They move to section three

353
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,522
formalizing brain design as structure

354
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,547
learning in generative models. So what

355
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,172
is the structure of this model and then

356
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,842
what does it look like to do structure

357
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,302
learning in that model and why is

358
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,672
it generative and then how is that

359
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:19,537
formalized?

360
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,122
So here's figure two, the generative

361
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,427
models and the generative process. So

362
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,152
the first words, the same second word is

363
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,822
different. So the different words and

364
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,772
the figure on the left side has the

365
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,752
entity. The figure on the right side has

366
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,827
the world state. So it's the same action

367
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:38,622
perception loop we saw in figure one.

368
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,112
And now this sort of conceptual flow

369
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,892
single edge model like just only one

370
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,952
arrow here, no extra anything, just sort

371
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,492
of first pass. It's compatible with

372
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,002
this which is actually a Bayesian graph.

373
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:55,677
But how do they describe it and what are

374
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,627
all the variables? We still have the

375
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:59,922
same things happening. We have the

376
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:02,777
observations coming in to the cognition

377
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,022
entity that's the observations coming

378
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:08,267
in. The entity

379
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,425
is going to infer some action policy

380
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,862
based upon the observations coming in

381
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,752
which is going to result in some change

382
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,527
to the actual underlying system, which

383
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,332
is the generative process. So that's

384
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,177
like the actual birds and the bees and

385
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:27,747
the sun and stuff. Allegedly it

386
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,927
does get into a little bit of a gray

387
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,727
area with the realism instrumentalism

388
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,107
and the structural realism. But we're

389
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,872
not even going to go there in this

390
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,142
discussion right now. The generative

391
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,847
process is the one that's handing out

392
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,277
the observations as modeled. The

393
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,422
generative model to close the loop is

394
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:46,437
the entity's inference. And so here is

395
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,947
X, the entity's prediction on hidden

396
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:52,677
state. And then here is X star which is

397
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,542
like the actual hidden state that is

398
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,262
being alleged in the world. And we've

399
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,177
had some other discussions about how

400
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,322
that's the sigma function. That's like

401
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,082
mapping between the two X's. That's

402
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:06,327
what's being minimized. If the

403
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:08,217
discrepancy is low, there's other

404
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:11,297
notation. How do the authors describe

405
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:13,377
it? The difference between the

406
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:14,987
generative models and the generative

407
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:18,797
process nodes

408
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,077
correspond to probability distributions

409
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,817
and edges to their statistical

410
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:25,067
dependencies. So this is like a Bayes

411
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,422
graph. Mathematically a generative

412
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,447
models may be formulated as the joint

413
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:33,162
probability density p of y

414
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,777
and x of observations y and hidden

415
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,572
states x of the world to generate those

416
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,917
observations. I think it was just a copy

417
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,702
errors. The latter are referred to as

418
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,552
hidden or latent states as they cannot

419
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:47,627
be observed directly. The joint

420
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,077
probability distribution can be

421
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:51,027
decomposed in two parts. The first is a

422
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,127
prior p of x, which denotes the

423
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,642
organism's knowledge about hidden states

424
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,297
of the world prior to seeing sensory

425
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,397
data. The second is the likelihood p

426
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,392
of y given x, which denotes the

427
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,197
organism's knowledge of how observations

428
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:05,202
are generated from states. So that's the

429
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,652
perceptual model. And then they go on to

430
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,212
describe how there's a difference

431
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:13,397
between the entity's inference on hidden

432
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,782
state and the actual hidden state,

433
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:18,752
which is the generative process versus

434
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,472
the generative model distinction. And

435
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:23,142
then they introduce Action and say

436
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,272
action you that's this node that

437
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,342
influences the hidden state, even if

438
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,567
zero effect is generated based upon the

439
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,147
inferences made under a generative

440
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:35,277
model. Action is shown here as part of

441
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,727
the generative model. Sorry, action is

442
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:40,067
shown here as part of the generative

443
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,597
process making changes to the world

444
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,457
despite being selected from the

445
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,292
inference drawn under the model. So

446
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:50,142
action is actually making influence gain

447
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,992
the edge could be zero in some respect,

448
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:53,952
but it's making active inference in the

449
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,007
world. It's like the active states

450
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,300
interpreted in a statistical way.

451
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,997
So what does that have to do with

452
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,347
structured learning? So the entity is

453
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:09,692
going to either whether you're a realist

454
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:11,442
and saying the entity is doing

455
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,547
structured learning or you're

456
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:16,647
instrumentalist, it is possible for us

457
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,822
as researchers today to model that

458
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,907
entity as doing structured learning

459
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,172
because it's computational efficient or

460
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,447
elucidative or you go full utilitarian,

461
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:28,167
you just say disregard that whole

462
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:30,617
realism instrumentalism. It's a useful

463
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,732
approach and I'll follow utility

464
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:35,787
wherever it goes for any number of those

465
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,772
reasons. You might want to model the

466
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:41,157
cognition of different entities without

467
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,347
going into just the philosophy of what

468
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,002
its cognitive process actually is. And

469
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,322
so one approach that's going to get

470
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,922
taken is using inference either

471
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,352
from the outside describing

472
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,447
instrumentally or realism as if it were

473
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,997
happening maybe with anatomical

474
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:59,247
evidence, as if the hidden state could

475
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,927
include not just parameters that were

476
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:02,637
continuous about the world, but also

477
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,237
structures of models.

478
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,667
However, it's difficult to imagine that

479
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,447
that type of cognitive or even extremely

480
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:13,937
metacognitive thought or action

481
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,157
selection could happen, for example, in

482
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:20,697
some early proto cell, however simple

483
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,622
it may have been. And so how do we get

484
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,550
from that flagella changing bacterium to

485
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:30,102
all the other kinds of cognition that we

486
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,797
see today, or should I say bacterium

487
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:37,527
like entity, relative or ancestor of

488
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:38,887
today's bacterium?

489
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,687
So how can we think about this model,

490
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,642
which is often described in the context

491
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,147
of parameter learning, and then approach

492
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:49,622
this as if it were maybe about parameter

493
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,102
learning sometimes. But also it could be

494
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,797
about structure in terms of the good

495
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,367
regulator and the requisite diversity,

496
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:57,972
that kind of requisite variety, those

497
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,427
kinds of models. Okay, the next several

498
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,357
sections are where they get to the

499
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:06,197
specifics and some of the contributions

500
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:08,517
of the paper that I think will be really

501
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,322
cool to continue the discussion on

502
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,802
section four is just short and it's

503
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,417
saying we're about to go into three

504
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:17,577
examples of simple predictive motifs and

505
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:19,152
ancestral brains. Because one of the

506
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,192
main claims of the paper is that these

507
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,367
motifs are very ancestral.

508
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,407
They're old motifs, they're not Johnny

509
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,102
come lately to the cognitive scene.

510
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:31,332
These are features that one can think of

511
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,022
as who knows how far back or

512
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,027
how simple these cognitive mechanisms

513
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,747
have existed, but we'll evaluate that

514
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,787
maybe when we get to talk together. But

515
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,227
first we'll just kind of go through how

516
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:45,807
they define them and use them. The three

517
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:48,047
predictive motifs are homeostasis

518
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:49,802
allostasis and simple behavioral

519
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:52,257
control. So first, five generative model

520
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,252
models for the homeostatic control of

521
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,362
interceptive variables.

522
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:00,787
They write the generative model models

523
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:03,027
shown in figure three, which we'll look

524
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,202
at after this slide, afford the

525
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,952
homeostatic regulation of a single

526
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,397
interceptive variable, which we call

527
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,367
here body temperature. For illustrative

528
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:16,227
purposes. Much like a thermostat, this

529
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,847
model maintains the requisite body

530
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,892
temperature by reporting the discrepancy

531
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,542
between predicted and sensed

532
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:24,167
thermoreceptor activation given Bayesian

533
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,997
beliefs about temperature triggering an

534
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,547
autonomic reflex u resulting in, for

535
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,147
example, vasodilation, which resolves

536
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,052
the prediction error. So if the life of

537
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,002
the organism were just to hang out on

538
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,142
the beach and vasodilate to off heat

539
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:42,692
when it needed to and then to constrict

540
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,757
and to save more heat when it needed to,

541
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:47,727
that's the biological task that this is

542
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,172
going to be describing, which is just

543
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:52,632
one facet of an organism's biology. But

544
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,822
there are experiments that sometimes

545
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,072
only measure temperature. And so

546
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:59,907
thinking instrumentally, this single

547
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:02,817
factor model, this single variable model

548
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:04,922
on body temperature may be sufficient

549
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,997
for some experiments or it may be useful

550
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,182
in certain cases. So just because it's a

551
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:12,177
simple model doesn't mean that it's not

552
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:14,802
going to be very educational and

553
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,252
provocative, but also even be sufficient

554
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:19,947
in a lot of cases. But no one's even

555
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,397
claiming it's realism. That's why it's

556
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,467
written this way. They say citation 20

557
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:27,822
for a fully specified example. And that

558
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:31,952
is a citation two. Chance et

559
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:35,277
al. In March 2022. So still in the

560
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:38,517
future and they write, we start

561
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,482
from the present premise and this is in

562
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,272
the paper that again is from the future,

563
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,347
we start from the premise that the goal

564
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:47,567
of interceptive control is to minimize

565
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,907
discrepancy between expected and actual

566
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:54,167
interceptive sensations I-E-A prediction

567
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:57,572
error or free energy. Importantly,

568
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,622
living organisms can active this goal by

569
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,502
using various forms of interceptive

570
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:04,002
control. Homeostatic allostasis, goal

571
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,902
directed. So there's more details in

572
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,082
this paper, but here in figure three

573
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,672
is where they're going to show it. So

574
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:15,207
keep in mind this generative model

575
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:18,850
structure. And now these are going to be

576
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:22,317
in a different form. And here in the

577
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,675
caption, I'll describe what they say.

578
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,052
This is the homeostatic, the first,

579
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:32,847
most ancestral, or just

580
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,437
the simplest possible. Just go

581
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,417
make it darker if it's too bright and

582
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,427
make it brighter if it's too dark. Make

583
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,077
it warmer if it's too cold. Make it

584
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:45,192
colder if it's too warm. That kind of

585
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,737
first order cybernetic loop.

586
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,477
This generative model includes an

587
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,087
interceptive, thermoreceptor Y

588
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,742
observations and a belief about body

589
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,497
temperature x. So that's the beliefs

590
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,627
about how the body should be. And that's

591
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:05,117
again, the beliefs playing that dual

592
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:09,372
function that the paper 37 drew out,

593
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,447
which is that on the left side of this

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,452
equation, failure to satisfy the

595
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,972
preferences is dealing with this P

596
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:21,552
distribution as a inference. But then on

597
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,397
the right side, p has to do with

598
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,047
expectations that are being either fit

599
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,717
well or poorly. And so this is where

600
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,102
active inference has a slightly

601
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,317
different architecture perhaps than some

602
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,992
other theories. The beliefs are about

603
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,947
body temperature. It's not an estimate

604
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:39,187
merely of the external body temperature.

605
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:42,572
Crucially, the prior over X is kept

606
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,602
fixed and hence it acts as a cybernetic

607
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:49,107
set point. Well, you can't just expect

608
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:50,702
what's going to be best for you. You'll

609
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,577
die, right? If you die, you die. But if

610
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,697
you enact policy such that your

611
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,722
expectations are realized, then you

612
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:00,872
persist. That's why we're studying

613
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,567
things that are persistent. Any

614
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,747
discrepancy between the predicted,

615
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,952
thermoreceptor activity given beliefs

616
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,352
about X and the measured Y is registered

617
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:11,927
as a prediction error that is canceled

618
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:14,052
out by an autonomic response. For

619
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,517
example, a thermoregulatory response.

620
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,882
This is shown as an illustrative plot of

621
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:21,392
the expectation of prior and posterior

622
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,772
observation and autonomic actions over

623
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:26,637
time. So here is like the action policy

624
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:29,112
which is like be at the baseline level

625
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,392
of thermoregulation and then kick in

626
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,987
some sweating or cooling mechanism.

627
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:37,422
And then here it describes how the

628
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,677
observations start at about 37 one and

629
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,822
then they steadily start climbing. And

630
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,757
then the belief, which is initially like

631
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:48,302
things should be 37. The posterior,

632
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,602
the after evidence estimate starts

633
00:26:51,632 --> 00:26:53,862
creeping up and then it hits a certain

634
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,877
value and it engages a critical

635
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,782
threshold that turns on this thermal

636
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,432
regulatory response and then that cools

637
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:02,352
the temperature back down. So this is a

638
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,767
basic architecture for doing first order

639
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:07,857
cybernetics and that kind of first order

640
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:10,992
logic. Here in this figure, the red

641
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,347
circles represent the expected values of

642
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,272
X, which are used to make predictions

643
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:19,472
about Y. These are subtracted red arrow

644
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:23,172
with the rounded end. So this one from

645
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:24,917
the measured Y to form a prediction

646
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,897
errors. Dark Bleu circle epsilon, which

647
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,847
is used to update the expectation and

648
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,457
drive action. Light Bleu circle you

649
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,432
here's, you that changes

650
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,252
why? Such that the prediction error is

651
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,577
resolved. What if it doesn't do it?

652
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:43,997
Well, then the system dies. So we're

653
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,747
talking about evolution where we've had

654
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,147
like for the ants, 120,000,000 years

655
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:50,772
allegedly for that to get Pruned out and

656
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:53,702
even longer at the cellular level. Note

657
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,977
the lateral modulatory connections in

658
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:57,702
the allostasis network, which we'll get

659
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,847
to in a second. So just to take one

660
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,057
little discourse, they say C 24

661
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,650
for details. What is PAP 24?

662
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:09,842
It is Friston, Par and de Verise, 2017.

663
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:11,822
The graphical Brain belief Propagation

664
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,277
and active inference. Let's just look at

665
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,767
a few parts of this awesome paper. So

666
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:19,202
first they have a table with definitions

667
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:21,702
of the technical terms. So just to kind

668
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,487
of read a few. But it's kind of awesome

669
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,602
to see the authors do this. And this is

670
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,197
in great paper as well. So how do they

671
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,202
define generative model, generative

672
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:33,400
Model or forward model?

673
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,972
A probabilistic mapping from causes to

674
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:39,987
observed consequences data. So from

675
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,082
hyper parameter to the parameter,

676
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,507
it is usually specified in terms of the

677
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,217
likelihood of getting some data given

678
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:49,302
their causes, parameters of the model

679
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,557
and priors on the parameters. So it's

680
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:54,672
all relative in nested models, but this

681
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:57,617
is generating data like kind of cranking

682
00:28:57,677 --> 00:29:01,197
out like a music box possible or

683
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,572
plausible data sets with similar summary

684
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,857
statistics, like similar mean invariance

685
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:09,312
of some distinctions or similar

686
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,847
parameters if there's a whole vector

687
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:13,525
that describe it. And then the

688
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,622
recognition model is related to

689
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,902
learning where new data are coming in

690
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,002
and discrepancy is being minimized. If

691
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,237
the generative is outputting the exact

692
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,142
same mean invariance that encoding data

693
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,947
are having the discrepancy is low, the

694
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,187
predictions which are about preferences

695
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,197
are being realized successfully. Action

696
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:35,052
policy is working well or better than

697
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,602
expected. Flip everything and you have

698
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,077
the opposite situation. And then just to

699
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,882
give one more definition here, because

700
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,102
the next slide will feature it, so the

701
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,900
others are also good to read.

702
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:51,317
Factor Graph factor graph is a bipartite

703
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:54,707
graph where two distinct sets of nodes

704
00:29:54,722 --> 00:29:57,477
are connected by edges representing the

705
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,697
factorization of a function, usually a

706
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,050
probability distribution function.

707
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:05,187
Formulating a Bayesian network or model

708
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,202
as a factor graph enables the efficient

709
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:09,862
computation of marginal distributions

710
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:13,312
through the sum product algorithm.

711
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,077
What does a factor graph look like and

712
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,427
how does it relate to the kinds of

713
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,747
Bayesian graphs that we've been looking

714
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,722
at? So on the top is not the Bayes graph

715
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:27,407
that's distributed across this slide,

716
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:29,757
but another variant that we've seen a

717
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,397
bunch of times, which is the partially

718
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:34,932
observable Markov decision process. So G

719
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,517
expected free energy minimization pi

720
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:39,987
policy selection is influencing B,

721
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,327
which is how S the latent state in the

722
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:44,372
world is changing through time. There's

723
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,767
D the prior on the hidden state and then

724
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:49,077
a the mapping of how the state is

725
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,387
related to the observation. And so

726
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,027
depending on how the models framed,

727
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,152
those can be learned or not. But it

728
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,327
turns out that because of how this is

729
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,252
relatively sparsely connected within a

730
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,622
time frame as well as across time

731
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,797
frames, there's a way to use this

732
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,902
bipartite construction called a factor

733
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,947
graph that splits up those unlabelled

734
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:13,142
edges which are statistical dependencies

735
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:17,097
and kind of interweaves functions which

736
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,072
have a slightly different

737
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:20,082
representation. And it turns out that by

738
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,677
interleaving these functions into the

739
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:26,132
variables, it's possible to make what's

740
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:28,272
called a factor graph and that gives an

741
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,347
order of operations to arbitrary or

742
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,122
within a certain set any kind of

743
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,792
Bayesian graph. But it includes this one

744
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,062
importantly. And so here is the one,

745
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,677
two, three time points and two policies

746
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:44,397
are being selected and that's what this

747
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,677
graph represents. The organism comes in

748
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:48,792
with a priori time step one, two,

749
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,717
three, there's two actions. And then

750
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,100
here's another figure from the paper

751
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:57,187
where at each of those three time steps,

752
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:01,300
one, two and three little figure

753
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:09,222
at time

754
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:11,397
steps one, two and three. So at times

755
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,752
step one, that's like anticipation and

756
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,912
planning. At timestep two it's like

757
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,147
short term anticipation as well as

758
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,517
memory. At timestep three it's like

759
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,827
memory and it's always now casting as

760
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,657
well. And so one can imagine that this

761
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,852
is a really useful format because it's

762
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:29,922
extremely composable on one hand. So

763
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,557
just like they said, okay, well we kind

764
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,812
of have this motif with three time steps

765
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,047
and they connected us. What if D from

766
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,467
the top level came down and was S

767
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:42,297
at a lower level? And we've seen that

768
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,477
taken to a really elaborated extent as

769
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,412
well as interpretation in for example,

770
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:49,422
the paper on mental action in Live

771
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:52,842
stream 25. And so factor graphs are

772
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,752
awesome because they're basically

773
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,732
needing to only be specified in the

774
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:00,887
Bayes graph format. But then it provides

775
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:04,467
not just a mesh connectivity but a

776
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,122
process algorithm and a heuristic and

777
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,597
approach that's actually tractable. So

778
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,997
we get the composable analytical and

779
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,482
graphical component that's an

780
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:15,562
intractable algorithm.

781
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,997
The next section is generative models

782
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,167
for the allostatic control of

783
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,477
interceptive variables. So this is going

784
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:27,027
to be the first real modification of the

785
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,947
homeostat that's introduced in three.

786
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:30,807
This is going to be the base case, but

787
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,592
it could be something else other than

788
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,547
body temperature. The homeostat is

789
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,472
simple but limited as they write. It can

790
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:40,542
counter sensed changes of body

791
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,347
temperature but cannot anticipate

792
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,297
predictable changes of body temperature

793
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,412
or other variables in nature.

794
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,755
There are several regularities eg night,

795
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,335
day or seasonal alternation that can be

796
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,860
easily incorporated to extend the above

797
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,375
generative models as technically

798
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,770
speaking, empirical priors. The obvious

799
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,755
advantage of predicting how our bodily

800
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,087
and interceptive variables will change

801
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,840
is being able to exert some anticipatory

802
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,760
or allostatic control. And so this is

803
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,980
kind of getting into the second order or

804
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:19,250
anticipatory cybernetics also related to

805
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:22,200
Rosen's anticipatory biology.

806
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,085
So here's figure three C.

807
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:28,540
In A and B there was just the homeostat

808
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,350
returning us to a set point after

809
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:32,815
something got triggered and now there's

810
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:34,310
going to be the affordance for

811
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:37,705
anticipatory control. This generative

812
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:40,930
models sketched out with the same scheme

813
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:45,130
as the previous slide. This generative

814
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,135
model extends the homeostat by

815
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,480
including. A second set of exteroception

816
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,785
variables that correspond to light

817
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:55,505
intensity y two and a belief about

818
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,405
sunrise x two. That's the sun visual

819
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,515
side on the right. Furthermore, like the

820
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,810
visual system and the left side is still

821
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:04,240
the temperature and interoceptive

822
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,190
system. Furthermore, the model includes

823
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,580
a predictive relationship between

824
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:11,285
sunrise x two and body temperature y.

825
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:13,940
This edge isn't saying that the sun

826
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:17,030
warms the body. It's saying that in this

827
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:19,115
model there's an edge reflecting a

828
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:21,215
statistical dependency and that's where

829
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:22,840
there's a degree of freedom with respect

830
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,275
to the blism and instrumentalism etc.

831
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,415
In this way inferring A, sunrise can

832
00:35:28,432 --> 00:35:30,635
trigger the autonomic response U of

833
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,860
thermal regulation in an anticipatory

834
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:35,125
manner, that is, before the sunlight

835
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
actually increases body temperature.

836
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,790
The other part of A and C are Bayesian

837
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,540
networks highlighting that Y is

838
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,715
conditionally dependent upon x with the

839
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:46,130
directed arrow between the notes with

840
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,590
more than one x and Y. In the model for

841
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:52,085
the allostap, the lower parts show the

842
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,840
form of neuronal message passing that

843
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,510
could be used to solve these generative

844
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,935
models. So the Bayes graph is

845
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,920
represented on the top and then there's

846
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,670
the message passing with respect to the

847
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:03,965
neural correlation. So that's kind of

848
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:07,180
the second aspect

849
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,015
of figures three, which is just bringing

850
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,890
in multisensory integration or even it

851
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,825
could be like two pixels, for example,

852
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,040
with beliefs about each other or

853
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,780
something like that. But that's what

854
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:20,210
allostasis is going to be enabled by is

855
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,865
just by this duplication of a column and

856
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:24,812
then this connection in a different way.

857
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,275
And then here's the third section of

858
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,840
four seven generative model models for

859
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:32,060
simple behavior control. And so they

860
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:35,840
write the

861
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,585
homeostat and the allostasis permit the

862
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:40,240
control of simple forms of swimming,

863
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,660
flow, motion reaching and other

864
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:44,885
movements. One biological example is

865
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,360
provided by the Zebrafish Virtual

866
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:49,865
Reality study 30 which identified the

867
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,490
neuronal underpinnings of error

868
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,510
correction during escape behavior in the

869
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,465
animal's telecephalon. It's a brain

870
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:58,565
region, brain evolution conserved set of

871
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,280
brain circuits involved in action

872
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,825
selection in other vertebrates,

873
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,790
including mammals such as the cortico

874
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,485
basal ganglia circuit. So that's about

875
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,065
the evolutionary anthropology of the

876
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,075
brain region. And then here's just some

877
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:15,140
pictures from the paper by

878
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:18,910
Tori Go. At all 21 zebrafish

879
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:20,855
capable of generating future state

880
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,215
prediction errors show improved active

881
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,525
avoidance behavior in virtual reality.

882
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,955
So they did a learning task that

883
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,740
involved the fish being able to

884
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,285
differentiate a signal and then they

885
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,190
studied the role of anticipation in

886
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:37,310
that. And the authors in this paper use

887
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,635
that as an example. Maybe we could talk

888
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,760
about that or other examples in the dot

889
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,312
one and the dot two two,

890
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,562
section eight.

891
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,800
Here's where we get to the very

892
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:55,340
interesting operations that are going

893
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:58,190
to bring this sort of descriptive model

894
00:37:58,282 --> 00:38:00,865
of different kinds of homeostatic

895
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,960
allostasis and intermodal and then

896
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:05,090
behavioral regulatory elements into the

897
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:08,455
evolutionary context. So our central

898
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:10,885
argument is that evolution proceeded via

899
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,210
gradual elaborations of the predictive

900
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:16,555
motifs illustrated above. Under genetic

901
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:19,865
constraints and opportunities and the

902
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,040
selective pressure of novel problems to

903
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:24,560
be solved, such as the control of more

904
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:26,510
sophisticated bodies in the presence of

905
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:29,090
richer ecological niches, e. G when

906
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,890
Vertebrates began to establish life on

907
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:34,325
land some 400 million years ago. Over

908
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:36,610
successive generations, generative

909
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,690
models can remain stable or be

910
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,395
elaborated along four key dimensions,

911
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,895
strongly limiting the space of what is

912
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:47,705
evolvable. So what are the four kinds of

913
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:49,725
dimensions that are going to be changed

914
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,975
that is going to be discussed in terms

915
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:56,960
of the changes that can happen to the

916
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,012
specifics of the generative model.

917
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,390
We have introduced the first kind of

918
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,545
elaboration from the unimodal homeostat

919
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,415
to the multimodal allostasis. So they

920
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,885
kind of secretly introduced this

921
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:11,285
transformation between figure three A,

922
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:14,660
B and figure three C. So that was

923
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:16,070
secretly like one of the

924
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:19,115
transformations. A second kind of

925
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:21,290
elaboration is the duplication of

926
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:23,285
predictive motifs which enlarges the

927
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:25,425
animal's behavior repertoire.

928
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,260
The third and fourth dimensions equip.

929
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,235
The generative models with temporal and

930
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,865
or hierarchical depth respectively.

931
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:36,265
These two expansions enable richer

932
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:38,380
predictive motifs that endow a cognitive

933
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,830
sophistication, such as the possibility

934
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,135
to plan or consider events that change

935
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,430
on multiple timescales. So it's the

936
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:49,735
evolutionary algebra on structured

937
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,040
learning because we're outputting a

938
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,920
structure, this graph g, which is going

939
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:57,980
to be like as if the species over

940
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:00,965
evolutionary time is going to be

941
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:04,160
implementing some graph in terms of the

942
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:07,315
structure of its model. Like if there's

943
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,655
a case where the Kant is not integrating

944
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:11,315
the polarization of light with the

945
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:13,655
olfactory system and then there's some

946
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,975
change in the model that actually

947
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,580
integrates them and then some

948
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,335
relationship is least, whatever that

949
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,215
means from a realist or instrumentalist

950
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,190
perspective. And that is going to be

951
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:23,920
like an evolutionary algebra. So it's

952
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,555
not going to be like two x minus three

953
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,985
x, but it's going to be more like that

954
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,530
than not because there's going to be

955
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:31,805
operations and they're going to happen

956
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:35,045
in order. So here's figure four

957
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:37,015
where they represent their evolutionary

958
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:39,305
algebra. Figure four, the five main

959
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,740
dimensions of elaboration of generative

960
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,520
model models introduced in the paper.

961
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:46,930
So it was four dimensions.

962
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,910
Then it's five dimensions. There's

963
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:53,035
evolution in 4D by Chablanca and Lamb

964
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,485
that would have been good to add to the

965
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,510
five main dimensions of elaboration of

966
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,535
generative model models introduced in

967
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:04,115
the paper, illustrated as operations of

968
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:06,260
an evolutionary algebra. So here's the

969
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,450
five operations. And so we're starting

970
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:11,395
with on the left side, that homeostat,

971
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:14,105
that simple corrective calibrative first

972
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,090
order cybernetics model, either what the

973
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,412
system is actually doing or model of.

974
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:21,980
Then there's going to be five

975
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:23,810
information that can happen and then

976
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:25,450
it's showing there's a second round,

977
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,910
like once you go H, you can go HTA I

978
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:32,785
plus I or I. So you have five discrete

979
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,090
options at the first time step, but one

980
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:36,995
of them is no change. So it's kind of

981
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,980
like no change or four different layers

982
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,480
of excitement of the electron like four

983
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,540
quanta. But they're for discrete

984
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,665
operations like a deletion or an

985
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:48,035
insertion in genomics. And then from

986
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,760
there it's just the state for the next

987
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:50,840
time step of the model. And then

988
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:52,115
something else happens. So what are the

989
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:55,385
operations? The bottom is I, which is

990
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,740
the identity operation that leave to

991
00:41:57,757 --> 00:42:00,515
generative models as is. So that can be

992
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:02,390
interpreted as like a non mutation or

993
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:04,835
just a conservative mode which is how

994
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:08,150
most inheritance works. Then the second

995
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:11,030
one is the duplication operation I plus

996
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:13,220
I. So it's like identity remains the

997
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,770
same but then there's a duplication.

998
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,465
Literally it's like a genomic

999
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:20,270
duplication but in this functional space

1000
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:22,790
replicates existing predictive motifs to

1001
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,690
form parallel sensory motor loops. A is

1002
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:28,640
the operation that was described in

1003
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:31,060
figure three. C the allostasis operation

1004
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:32,960
endowed the generative model with

1005
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:35,150
horizontal predictive relations between

1006
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:37,460
different modalities. And so the

1007
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:40,412
implication would be like going from one

1008
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:44,005
sensella, one antenna to two antenna

1009
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:46,430
or going from one photoreceptor to two

1010
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,095
photoreceptors. But the actual

1011
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,420
architectures of the column of the

1012
00:42:50,422 --> 00:42:52,340
photosensory transduction cascade would

1013
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:54,710
basically be computationally or

1014
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:56,615
statistically unchanged. And then the

1015
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:58,700
allostasis is actually bringing in this

1016
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:01,862
horizontal aspect. It's not just two

1017
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:04,685
duplicated systems next to each other.

1018
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,755
Now there's actually connections between

1019
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:09,320
them and of the possible kinds of

1020
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,165
connections across columns. One of them

1021
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,575
is like this classic allostatic motif.

1022
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,655
Then there's the ones that we haven't

1023
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:17,915
gone into as much, which are T. The

1024
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:20,240
temporal depth operation extends the

1025
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:22,060
generative models with separate

1026
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:23,855
variables for past, present and future

1027
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:27,235
states. So it's kind of from a graphical

1028
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,015
perspective what we looked at in a

1029
00:43:29,032 --> 00:43:31,585
difference between the first factor

1030
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,760
graph which did take action at three

1031
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:38,585
time steps three timesteps like

1032
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,310
the thermostat does to the one that

1033
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:42,160
actually has either prospectively

1034
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,060
looking anticipation about future time

1035
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:46,525
steps or retrospectively looking memory.

1036
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:48,185
But that's how the factor graph comes

1037
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:51,790
into play, that's temporal

1038
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,555
depth. Then the hierarchical

1039
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:58,285
depth operation H extends the generative

1040
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,410
model with separate variables for states

1041
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:01,895
of affairs that change at different

1042
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,820
timescales faster time scales at the

1043
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,695
bottom levels and slower time scales at

1044
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:08,740
the higher levels. Hence modeling

1045
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,360
narratives such as music and language

1046
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:12,280
where nested timescales are relevant.

1047
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,585
So to kind of split that idea of

1048
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:17,440
temporal depth into two pieces, there's

1049
00:44:17,545 --> 00:44:19,240
incrementing the number of steps you're

1050
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,565
looking in the model that's increasing

1051
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:24,170
the time horizon on policy selection and

1052
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,315
increasing the temporal depth within a

1053
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:28,430
level. And then there's this notion of

1054
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:31,235
nesting levels within each other.

1055
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,560
That's the nested generative model and

1056
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:35,925
therefore nested Markov blanket

1057
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,590
discussion that we've been having and

1058
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:42,155
that is going to be connected to

1059
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:44,455
cognition activities like narrative.

1060
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,045
And the reason why they're very similar

1061
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:50,185
is that the time scales can kind of blur

1062
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,580
into each other. And so it's all about

1063
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:55,535
the models structure as stated. Like

1064
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,670
this one is hierarchical and it has a

1065
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:00,530
depth of three. It's a two layer model

1066
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:02,240
and it has a depth of three, three time

1067
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:04,790
steps are included. And it could be

1068
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:06,455
different if there was always looking

1069
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:08,465
two ahead and always looking to in the

1070
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,970
back. Then the model in the computer

1071
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,730
would need like a minimum of five time

1072
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,235
steps. But the entity's model could

1073
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:18,935
still be restricted to S minus two, s

1074
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,635
minus one, and then S plus one, s plus

1075
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:28,685
two. So those

1076
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,235
are the two ways that it can expand in

1077
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:33,055
these two temporal and hierarchical

1078
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:37,045
ways, which is to nest hierarchical

1079
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,665
model to become temporarily deeper with

1080
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,635
a longer horizon given the nesting

1081
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,600
structure. So these are all structural

1082
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,065
changes. That's why there was the whole

1083
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:46,805
piece about structured learning because

1084
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:49,280
it's as if or actually like over

1085
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:50,890
evolution time there's the structured

1086
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,985
learning happen. And then if we use this

1087
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,495
partitioning and Bayes graph approach,

1088
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,685
then hypothetically, any kind of

1089
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,740
evolutionary starting point if we go

1090
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,035
back far enough and then final state,

1091
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:05,090
if we have all the transitions, could be

1092
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:07,090
modeled within like a native active

1093
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,830
inference framework. Section Nine

1094
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:11,060
they're going to go into a little more

1095
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:12,865
detail about duplicating, predictive

1096
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,655
motifs and enabling multiple behavior.

1097
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,265
So they write, how does

1098
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:23,465
this duplication of the model looking at

1099
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:25,535
it from the outside, it's like as if

1100
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:27,835
they're acting as if there's two models

1101
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,765
looking at it from the realism in the

1102
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:32,210
inside. It's kind of like thinking about

1103
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,955
the real duplication of a cognition

1104
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,530
function that's functionalism or like

1105
00:46:36,577 --> 00:46:38,690
even a neuroanatomical region like the

1106
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,495
earlier examples with the retinal cells.

1107
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,430
And that's like canonical realism. So

1108
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,065
generative models can expand by

1109
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,690
duplicating simple predictive motifs to

1110
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:49,510
form a larger repertoire of species

1111
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:51,235
specific behavior such as approach

1112
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,415
avoidance, the control of the vibrace

1113
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:57,825
and visually guided grasping classic.

1114
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:00,725
The operator I plus I in figure four

1115
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:02,510
illustrates a generative model in which

1116
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,190
the same predictive motifs are

1117
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:06,590
duplicated and specialized to form a

1118
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:08,390
behavior based architecture composed of

1119
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:10,765
multiple parallel sensory motor loops.

1120
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,710
So they're suggesting that because these

1121
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,885
are your affordances, your operations in

1122
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:17,060
your evolutionary algebra, you can go

1123
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:19,040
from this starting point, it's kind of

1124
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:21,785
like go to leisure balk starting point

1125
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:24,110
and then doing operations to it.

1126
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:26,420
Because you have the starting point and

1127
00:47:26,422 --> 00:47:28,715
the operations to it, it allows you to

1128
00:47:28,732 --> 00:47:33,100
get to even relatively advanced motifs

1129
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:35,175
like approach avoidance, etc.

1130
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,255
But a key piece is duplication because

1131
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,070
implication of something without

1132
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:44,795
changing it is how you are able to build

1133
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:48,155
more land to experiment in, so to speak,

1134
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:52,510
build more space. And I copied

1135
00:47:52,555 --> 00:47:55,765
some images from genetics specifically

1136
00:47:55,795 --> 00:47:57,445
in the relationship of how gene

1137
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,480
duplication and divergence in the early

1138
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:02,162
evolution of vertebrates this paper.

1139
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:04,660
And there's a huge amount of cybernetics

1140
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:07,255
and genomics works on the duplication

1141
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:08,345
and divergence and the

1142
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,710
neofunctionalization, the

1143
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:11,720
subfunctionalization. Because if you

1144
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,870
have like an enzyme or essential gene a

1145
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,580
now to go into the whole gene thing

1146
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,685
totally another time though, you could

1147
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:22,040
have the function of the second copy in

1148
00:48:22,057 --> 00:48:24,590
the genome be lost and then there is

1149
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:25,940
still like a continuous line of

1150
00:48:25,957 --> 00:48:27,715
function. So if you only needed one copy

1151
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:30,665
of a then this would be sufficient. And

1152
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:32,540
then other times when you have a and

1153
00:48:32,557 --> 00:48:34,760
it's dual function like it binds to two

1154
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,425
different, not exactly similar

1155
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:39,190
molecules, then when there's a paralogy,

1156
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,885
when there's this duplication, it allows

1157
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,715
subfunctionalization or new functions to

1158
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:46,535
arise. So that's how people talk about

1159
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,210
it and link it to realism in genomics.

1160
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,885
And this is kind of approaching that

1161
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,875
from a cognitive perspective.

1162
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,490
There's probably more to say, but we'll

1163
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,690
talk more about the duplicating of

1164
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,855
predictive motifs. So how is duplicating

1165
00:49:01,915 --> 00:49:05,335
predictive motifs enabling of multiple

1166
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,410
behavior? Okay, they write from a

1167
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:10,930
structured learning perspective,

1168
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,830
duplication is an efficient way of

1169
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:14,690
building generative model models. And

1170
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:16,460
that's what it's all about in the sense

1171
00:49:16,492 --> 00:49:18,110
that the dynamics are conserved over

1172
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:20,435
different sensory motor domain. This

1173
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:23,060
conservation is mathematically akin to

1174
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,415
factorizing probability distributions on

1175
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,260
the generative model that has been

1176
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:28,675
discussed in terms of modular

1177
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,000
architectures and functional segregation

1178
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:32,860
as a principle of functional brain

1179
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:35,905
architectures in Bayesian Statistics

1180
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,865
physics, this kind of factorization is

1181
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:39,830
ubiquitous and known as a mean field

1182
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:42,950
approximation. Indeed, the free energy

1183
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:45,365
bound on model evidence is defined in

1184
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:49,760
terms of a mean field approximation that

1185
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,550
affords an accuracy and minimally

1186
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,200
complex explanation for sensory data.

1187
00:49:54,337 --> 00:49:55,900
And so what are some of these citations?

1188
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:59,060
44 modular architectures for

1189
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,195
factorization of probability

1190
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:03,805
distinctions in the generative models

1191
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,460
par Sajid, Karl Friston 2020 entropy so

1192
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:09,062
here is kind of a cool figure,

1193
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,465
nice graph and then there's

1194
00:50:13,495 --> 00:50:16,780
the message passing and then citation.

1195
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,415
48 the mean field approximation what is

1196
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:23,735
it? Here's a paper from 2001 and

1197
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,240
they wrote algorithms that must deal

1198
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,160
with complicated global functions of

1199
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,430
many variables often exploit the manner

1200
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,720
in which the given functions factor as a

1201
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:35,090
product of local interactions, each of

1202
00:50:35,107 --> 00:50:36,515
which depends on a subset of the

1203
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,155
variables. Such a factorization can be

1204
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,880
visualized with a bipartite

1205
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,595
graph that we call a

1206
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:50,305
factor graph. A wide variety

1207
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,660
of algorithms developed in artificial

1208
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:55,010
intelligence, signal processing and

1209
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,915
digital communications can be derived as

1210
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,925
specific instances of the sum product

1211
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:02,390
algorithm, including the

1212
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,495
forward backward algorithm, the Viterbi

1213
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,490
algorithm, the Iterative turbo decoding

1214
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,190
algorithm, pearl's 1988 belief

1215
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,990
propagation algorithm for Bayesian

1216
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,985
Networks hashtag Markov blankets, the

1217
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,855
common filter and certain fast fouryear

1218
00:51:16,915 --> 00:51:19,570
transforms FFT algorithms.

1219
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:23,165
So it was 21 years ago when this

1220
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:25,487
was happening and now we're here.

1221
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,410
OK? Section Ten endowing generative

1222
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:31,510
models with temporal depth supports,

1223
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,105
perspective and retrospective Inference

1224
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,355
so just like we looked at with that

1225
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:41,100
factor graph, giving this operation

1226
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,135
over evolutionary time enables that

1227
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,280
factor graph to arise from something

1228
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:49,190
with the lower time horizon. The

1229
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,780
generative model models discussed so far

1230
00:51:50,827 --> 00:51:52,190
only consider present states and

1231
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:53,690
observations. However, they can be

1232
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:55,390
expanded into temporally deep models

1233
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,085
whose variables explicitly represent

1234
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,440
future and past states and observations.

1235
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,730
So this is what the operation looks

1236
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:05,030
like. It takes XT and then at

1237
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:07,615
XT plus one or tau depending on how it's

1238
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:09,905
written. And then now there's another

1239
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,735
time step appended to the end of this

1240
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:16,165
model, either actually or as if here's

1241
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:17,885
something cool that they wrote. They

1242
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,385
wrote various researchers have

1243
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:21,565
speculated that a major driving force

1244
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:23,140
for the development of deep temporal

1245
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,065
models was foraging. So why would this

1246
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:29,750
happen functionally? Which is to say,

1247
00:52:29,887 --> 00:52:32,025
why does the mutational spectra,

1248
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:34,715
which does allow for this as an

1249
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:37,190
affordance end up selecting four and

1250
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,555
retaining and enriching force

1251
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:40,490
temporarily deep models? Otherwise we

1252
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:43,210
wouldn't observe it to exist and they're

1253
00:52:43,255 --> 00:52:44,905
connecting that to foraging.

1254
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,735
Intriguingly, this is a vertebrate

1255
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,285
example. The same hippocampal circuits

1256
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,065
that support spatial navigation and

1257
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:52,835
foraging are also involved in

1258
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:56,630
prospection and imagination. This has

1259
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:59,360
led Buzsaki and Mosser to propose that

1260
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:01,240
prospective function have leveraged

1261
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,470
cognitive and predictive maps in the

1262
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,710
hippocampal entorhinal system. And hence

1263
00:53:05,755 --> 00:53:07,910
mechanisms of memory and planning have

1264
00:53:07,942 --> 00:53:10,085
evolved from mechanisms of navigation in

1265
00:53:10,117 --> 00:53:12,365
the physical world. So what are the

1266
00:53:12,382 --> 00:53:15,455
cognitive demands of foraging? How about

1267
00:53:15,502 --> 00:53:18,085
information foraging? How about mental

1268
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,110
foraging? Here s some awesome papers by

1269
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:24,035
Hills and Cuisine and others foraging in

1270
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:27,040
mind and foraging in semantic fields.

1271
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,285
How we search through memory. So what

1272
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:32,450
about mental foraging? What about

1273
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:34,950
individual and collective foraging?

1274
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,640
This is an awesome paper by Feynman and

1275
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:40,985
Corman in 2017 and they talk about the

1276
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,085
continuum and the complementarity of

1277
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:45,035
individual and collective approaches to

1278
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:46,685
cognition. And so implicitly, like

1279
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:48,965
foraging as a phenomena some of the

1280
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:51,290
affordances and the neurophysiology of

1281
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:53,480
foraging in ants, it's the same

1282
00:53:53,602 --> 00:53:56,300
materials and mechanism that any other

1283
00:53:56,362 --> 00:53:59,360
insect that's not eusocial has. So the

1284
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:01,415
detection of light, the intensity, the

1285
00:54:01,432 --> 00:54:03,215
wavelength, the polarization, sometimes

1286
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:06,305
the ability to do chemo sensation like

1287
00:54:06,352 --> 00:54:08,110
taste and smell, mechanical reception,

1288
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:10,625
etc. And the same action affordances too

1289
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,575
like movement. And so there definitely

1290
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:15,580
is nest mate levels cognition in ants.

1291
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:18,065
But also there's things that are of a

1292
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:19,715
few different interesting types. One of

1293
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:22,820
them is meso scale like small group

1294
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:25,540
dynamics, stochastic teams and larger

1295
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,945
scale like colony and even colony niche

1296
00:54:29,035 --> 00:54:31,810
stigma g and ecological scale cognitive

1297
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:34,580
processes. Like these two ants are

1298
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:36,985
interacting and modifying each other's

1299
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,130
foraging behavior, mechanistically and

1300
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,160
statistically. But also it wouldn't

1301
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:43,820
happen unless the niche were exactly

1302
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:46,085
this way which they have also in their

1303
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,215
extended selves established for

1304
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:50,630
themselves. So how do we think about

1305
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:53,210
individual and collective foraging and

1306
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:56,140
stigma g in complex systems and mental

1307
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,890
foraging and cognitive demands and

1308
00:54:57,907 --> 00:55:01,735
cognition security? What about section

1309
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,860
eleven endowing generative models with

1310
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:06,010
hierarchical depth affords multiscale

1311
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:07,445
inference. So now we get to the

1312
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,695
hierarchical operation that is going to

1313
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:12,935
give that multiscale inference. So far

1314
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,540
we have described generative models that

1315
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:16,085
can deal with aspects of the world that

1316
00:55:16,117 --> 00:55:18,935
unfold at single timescale. So plus one

1317
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:21,265
plus one plus one timescale is temporal

1318
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:23,720
depth. But you're getting still only one

1319
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:25,575
extra per transformation.

1320
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,820
However, they can be expanded into

1321
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:31,540
hierarchical model models whose

1322
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,355
variables at different hierarchical

1323
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:35,245
levels encode latent states that unfold

1324
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,310
at different timescales. One example is

1325
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:39,560
a song. Melody remains the same even

1326
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:41,405
though the notes we hear or sing change

1327
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:44,890
rapidly and speech. Similarly, a movie

1328
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,790
or narrative remains the same for

1329
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:48,830
several minutes. Scenes remain the same

1330
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:51,040
for several seconds, but visual stimuli

1331
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,460
can change over hundreds of

1332
00:55:52,492 --> 00:55:55,195
milliseconds. Such models permit

1333
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:58,355
hierarchical models permit modeling of

1334
00:55:58,402 --> 00:55:59,250
narratives,

1335
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:05,755
songs, movies and other events that

1336
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:08,140
change at different temporal scales by

1337
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,685
encoding variables that change more

1338
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:12,655
slowly eg melodies or movies at higher

1339
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,490
hierarchical levels and variables that

1340
00:56:15,507 --> 00:56:17,710
change more rapidly. Egypt notes or

1341
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:20,160
visual scenes at lower hierarchical

1342
00:56:20,205 --> 00:56:23,605
leave to neurobiological examples of

1343
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:25,935
hierarchical organization are visual

1344
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,120
areas in mammals and areas that control

1345
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:30,940
vocal gestures in birdsong, which has

1346
00:56:30,957 --> 00:56:32,610
been studied active inference lab

1347
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,855
several times. And so here's another

1348
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:37,215
quote from the authors in more advanced

1349
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:39,160
animals, the hierarchical control of

1350
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:40,810
action may have expanded into

1351
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:42,745
sophisticated forms of cognitive control

1352
00:56:42,822 --> 00:56:46,435
and executive function. Layer one

1353
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:49,305
scare quotes which help prioritize

1354
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,465
digital goals while inhibiting immediate

1355
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,925
affordance. So it's not just about

1356
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:57,200
seeing deeper within a time scale,

1357
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:00,190
but it's about being able to pull up to

1358
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,125
a higher time scale and then from there,

1359
00:57:02,187 --> 00:57:04,840
after the H operation, it can be

1360
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:07,690
followed up with a T operation. So

1361
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:11,070
here's the minute scale and then there's

1362
00:57:11,085 --> 00:57:13,590
a hierarchical implication that allows

1363
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,495
for the hour scale and then that can go

1364
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:19,315
into 2 hours and now two minutes. So now

1365
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:22,000
there's a twohour and two minute long

1366
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:24,310
model instead of a 1 minute. And it was

1367
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:26,515
just two computational. But if the two

1368
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:29,335
computational had been or the three

1369
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:32,340
mutations had been just going deeper

1370
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,690
within the minutes, it would be a

1371
00:57:34,707 --> 00:57:38,335
different outcome. How is

1372
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,275
that functional? So what is the function

1373
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:45,130
and the cost of temporal depth just

1374
00:57:45,177 --> 00:57:47,235
instrumentally? When we're studying

1375
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,435
diverse cognitive systems, how can we

1376
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:53,370
detect temporal depth and versus

1377
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,860
hierarchical nesting? Then what is

1378
00:57:56,892 --> 00:57:59,260
the meaning and the role of narrative in

1379
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,810
cognition? How does this relate to

1380
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,875
narrative information management?

1381
00:58:04,975 --> 00:58:07,405
All right, section twelve. Getting

1382
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:11,200
towards the end in the above, which was

1383
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:13,180
again the description of the simple

1384
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,510
motifs in 4567 and

1385
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:19,540
then the evolutionary algebra in eight

1386
00:58:19,632 --> 00:58:21,660
and then several of these finer scale

1387
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:24,575
discussions on nine and ten. In eleven,

1388
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,835
we then get to twelve. In the above, we

1389
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,635
formalized brain designs in terms of

1390
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:30,960
generative models that include

1391
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:33,285
predictive loops of various complexity

1392
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,535
red and then discuss the five main ways

1393
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:38,320
in which generative model designs can be

1394
00:58:38,322 --> 00:58:41,230
elaborated. Green or the five main

1395
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:43,165
interactions of an algebra of

1396
00:58:43,182 --> 00:58:44,530
evolutionary structured learning.

1397
00:58:44,577 --> 00:58:47,185
Figure four. This means that one can

1398
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:49,510
describe the evolutionary trajectory of

1399
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,435
brain designs in terms of a limited

1400
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,335
number of computational operations over

1401
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:56,725
generative models. Bleu so here

1402
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:00,250
is a phylogenetic tree on the right side

1403
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:03,325
with the tree of life.

1404
00:59:03,462 --> 00:59:04,837
One of the tree of life.

1405
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,965
What are alternative complexity or

1406
00:59:08,982 --> 00:59:10,450
traditional ways to think about

1407
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:13,905
phylogenetic trees in evolutionary

1408
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:16,575
biology? Are phylogenetic trees

1409
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:20,215
interpreted instrumentally? Are they

1410
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:22,005
interpreted under a realism framework?

1411
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:23,785
Is that what really happened to those

1412
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:26,835
species? Or is it our model inference

1413
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,325
about what is the relationship between

1414
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:31,900
active inference in the free energy

1415
00:59:31,962 --> 00:59:34,025
principle and evolution?

1416
00:59:35,425 --> 00:59:39,010
Okay, they have figure five, which gets

1417
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,290
at their phylogenetic model. So this is

1418
00:59:41,307 --> 00:59:43,225
a phylogenetic free of generative model

1419
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:46,080
designs and putative correspondences

1420
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,710
with animal brains. So here's the

1421
00:59:47,742 --> 00:59:52,360
implied interface states and then I is

1422
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:53,935
going to be the identity operator. So

1423
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,785
here the orange species has not mutated

1424
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,815
at all. Now, sometimes this

1425
00:59:59,832 --> 01:00:02,065
is conflated with simply being an

1426
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:03,940
outgroup. Just because it is that way

1427
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:04,870
doesn't mean they're making the

1428
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:06,685
conflation. But sometimes people will

1429
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,140
make the conflation. That because a

1430
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:09,955
species is an out group to some other

1431
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:12,340
clade that has been included in the

1432
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:15,010
analysis that it is the basil or

1433
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:17,365
primitive form. And so it does happen to

1434
01:00:17,382 --> 01:00:19,885
be that way in this example that the

1435
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:23,110
basal is the so called least derived or

1436
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:26,185
most primitive or basal form. But my

1437
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:28,840
personal thought is that it should not

1438
01:00:28,857 --> 01:00:32,035
be described. And Tim Linsker and others

1439
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:34,215
have awesome writing on that evolution

1440
01:00:34,245 --> 01:00:36,540
fallacy. So in the rest of the tree,

1441
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,055
which is being focused on, different

1442
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,665
kinds of operations happen. So here's

1443
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,075
that I plus I implication and then

1444
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:44,920
there's no change after that. And then

1445
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:48,280
this one has a and so on. So just like

1446
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:50,235
you could trace the phenotype changing

1447
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,570
through time on a tree inferred from

1448
01:00:52,722 --> 01:00:55,390
trait or genomic data, which is just

1449
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:58,450
another trait, this maps up to certain

1450
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:00,885
changes that are seen neuroanatomically

1451
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:04,210
over vertebrate evolution. And it

1452
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:07,090
reminded me of this paper, which was

1453
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:10,312
Chakra Borzi and Jarvis 2015.

1454
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:12,690
And so that is the paper, brain

1455
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,700
evolution by brain pathway duplication.

1456
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,680
So they don't connect it to in the exact

1457
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:20,215
same way, the neurocognitive and the

1458
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:22,465
functional and active inference lab and

1459
01:01:22,482 --> 01:01:24,190
all that. But this paper does get out

1460
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:26,215
some of the very similar ideas about the

1461
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:28,390
functional duplication arising as a

1462
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:31,100
result of pathway duplication.

1463
01:01:33,925 --> 01:01:36,885
They have a section on brain complexity

1464
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:39,010
and pathway evolution. They talk about

1465
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,960
some alternative hypotheses and then

1466
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:42,885
talk about distributed and duplicated

1467
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,470
morphological structures. So it's a kind

1468
01:01:44,472 --> 01:01:46,030
of interesting paper from about seven

1469
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,580
years ago. Another paper that's very

1470
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:50,590
related to this idea of doing like an

1471
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:52,980
evolutionary algebra with combinatorics

1472
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,212
but also a path dependence is this paper

1473
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:58,465
pretty recently, just a couple of days

1474
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,135
ago by Ryan Smith, Maxwell Ramsden and

1475
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:03,960
Alex Kilner. The paper is why Bayesian

1476
01:02:04,005 --> 01:02:05,985
brains perform poorly on explicit

1477
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,725
probabilistic reasoning problems. So

1478
01:02:08,787 --> 01:02:10,735
look at this tree that they have the

1479
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:12,975
starting point and then three action.

1480
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:15,225
So here it's like divide, divide,

1481
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,005
multiply, divide, add, divide.

1482
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,600
And then they study that in the context

1483
01:02:21,675 --> 01:02:23,680
of Bayesian brain and doing

1484
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:25,935
calculations, why is it hard to multiply

1485
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,960
numbers together sometimes? So then the

1486
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:31,750
authors of the paper 38, right?

1487
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:34,065
Interestingly, the mutational operators

1488
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:36,730
are commutive. The same generative model

1489
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:38,515
design can be obtained by executing the

1490
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:39,880
same operations but in a different

1491
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:43,390
order. The communication property of

1492
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,315
mutational operators potentially sheds

1493
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,085
light on the conversion, evolution and

1494
01:02:48,117 --> 01:02:50,040
the process by which unrelated organisms

1495
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,510
evolve similar traits independently and

1496
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,255
via different evolutionary histories

1497
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:55,825
when they need to adapt to similar

1498
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:58,837
ecological niches. That's pretty cool.

1499
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,195
All right, so just the discussion and

1500
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:03,315
then a few last points. So discussion

1501
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:04,930
and the authors summarize it in this

1502
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:07,065
article. We suggest that brain structure

1503
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,055
or design could be formalized as

1504
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:14,035
generative models agree disagree that

1505
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:15,415
the brain generative model models of our

1506
01:03:15,432 --> 01:03:17,530
evolutionary ancestral included simple

1507
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:21,535
predictive motifs agree disagree and

1508
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:23,730
that the evolution proceeded via

1509
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,360
successive elaborations of these

1510
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:27,405
predictive motifs into more brain

1511
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:28,885
architectures that we observe in

1512
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:31,240
advanced animals. They then talked about

1513
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:32,710
the ways that that can change through

1514
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,650
time functionally. And then they write

1515
01:03:35,787 --> 01:03:37,735
while the evolutionary trajectory of

1516
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,285
designs for predictive processing

1517
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:41,215
proposed here is certainly tentative and

1518
01:03:41,232 --> 01:03:43,435
incomplete, we consider it a first step

1519
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:44,865
towards the alignment of predictive

1520
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,390
brains and evolutionary studies of

1521
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:49,045
neuroanatomy in different species. So if

1522
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:50,515
this is the first step, where are we

1523
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:53,125
headed and why do we prefer and expect

1524
01:03:53,187 --> 01:03:55,237
ourselves to be there or go there?

1525
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:58,165
Just a few more topics that we could

1526
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,815
talk about, like in the dot one and then

1527
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:03,460
the dot two. First would be they write

1528
01:04:03,492 --> 01:04:05,750
that the error correction mechanisms,

1529
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:09,205
in their view encompass the simple and

1530
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:11,675
the complex forms of adaptive behavior

1531
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,195
hashtag intuitive theory. And they're

1532
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,440
going to argue that that differs

1533
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:17,865
significantly from prevalent

1534
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,390
perspectives in psychology and

1535
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:22,185
neuroscience, which tend to separate

1536
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,985
sets of mechanisms for sensory motor

1537
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,460
processing and simple cognition. So how

1538
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,065
is active inference similar and

1539
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:30,535
different to other frameworks for

1540
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:33,165
behavior? What are the building blocks

1541
01:04:33,195 --> 01:04:36,690
of adaptive behavior? What are the basal

1542
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,050
blocks of just any kind of behavior?

1543
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,730
Where does sensory motor integration

1544
01:04:41,865 --> 01:04:44,940
come into play? How about mental

1545
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,530
functions and cognitive functions like

1546
01:04:47,577 --> 01:04:49,740
memory, anticipation, counterfactuals,

1547
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,885
etc. Okay, another point

1548
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,610
to kind of think about or write your

1549
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:57,160
questions down and reflect on is the

1550
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:59,205
perspective which is still speculative

1551
01:04:59,265 --> 01:05:01,720
and not unchallenged suggests that the

1552
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:03,435
complexity of the ecological niche

1553
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,215
determines the level of complexity that

1554
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:07,000
the brain needs to have in order to be

1555
01:05:07,062 --> 01:05:09,100
Bayesian optimal. In other words,

1556
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:10,860
brains only increase their complexity

1557
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:13,360
with sufficient ecological demands. So

1558
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:15,660
not necessarily just that mutational

1559
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,985
direction and intensity will go towards

1560
01:05:19,092 --> 01:05:20,590
increasing brain complexity from

1561
01:05:20,607 --> 01:05:22,740
ecological demands. The Socalled

1562
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,660
anticipatory evolution that cognitive

1563
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:25,885
entities can have through

1564
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,795
selfmonification and niche modification.

1565
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,220
But even for those that aren't actually

1566
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:32,590
doing anticipation still it could be the

1567
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:35,190
case that when the ecological demands

1568
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,265
are such that a behavior model increase

1569
01:05:38,295 --> 01:05:40,210
in complexity is selected for and

1570
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:41,965
retained, then evolution will go that

1571
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:44,335
way. This is because having a more

1572
01:05:44,367 --> 01:05:45,940
complicated brain does not help if you

1573
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:48,115
live in a simple niche. So that's like a

1574
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:50,605
very costly model that's not giving you

1575
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:52,925
any more return on investment.

1576
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,605
They then talk about how the social

1577
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,690
brain hypothesis states that the

1578
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:00,265
necessity to predict and deal with

1579
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:02,110
sophisticated social dynamics was a main

1580
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:03,990
driver of the evolution of large brains

1581
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,115
and sophisticated cognitive abilities in

1582
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:09,115
our species people. In short, the

1583
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,685
gradualism expressed as a progressive

1584
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,915
increase in complexity rests on the

1585
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,865
circular causality implicit in the

1586
01:06:15,882 --> 01:06:17,785
modeling of an eco niche that is itself

1587
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:20,035
constituted and constructed by

1588
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:22,945
increasingly complicated phenotypes. So

1589
01:06:23,097 --> 01:06:24,685
because it's so important to think

1590
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:26,620
through other minds first just how

1591
01:06:26,622 --> 01:06:28,390
you're going to materially avoid a

1592
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,190
spatial collision. But then, so the

1593
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:32,490
social brain hypothesis goes, includes

1594
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,360
increasingly recursive levels of game

1595
01:06:34,392 --> 01:06:36,670
theory, market theory, and all this kind

1596
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:39,015
of stuff, and related indirect cognitive

1597
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:40,915
phenotypes required like memory and

1598
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:43,560
recognition, narrative understanding,

1599
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,435
rhetorical understanding, governance,

1600
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,325
et cetera. That is,

1601
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:51,955
being positive as compatible with

1602
01:06:52,002 --> 01:06:53,755
the models the authors have written and

1603
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,440
a hypothesis that others have written

1604
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,865
about, not from active inference lab

1605
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,485
perspective, though in most cases. So

1606
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:01,375
what is the cognition niche for social

1607
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:03,775
entities, our material niche and our

1608
01:07:03,837 --> 01:07:06,565
social cognitive niche? What is the

1609
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:09,175
social brain? What is the use social

1610
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:11,965
brain? How are they related? So for

1611
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:14,770
example, the social brain is saying that

1612
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:16,510
the more social things are, the more

1613
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,730
sophisticated the brain has to be. We

1614
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:20,440
need more narrative understanding and

1615
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:23,715
more memory. But what if in the Eusocial

1616
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:27,115
case the brain is simpler on board for

1617
01:07:27,132 --> 01:07:29,980
examples, it's more role based or

1618
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:32,455
temporal polyethym has allowed more

1619
01:07:32,502 --> 01:07:34,960
reduction in each phase of the life

1620
01:07:34,992 --> 01:07:38,455
cycle brain. So does

1621
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:40,915
social lead to you social? How does your

1622
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,640
sociality arise and how does it

1623
01:07:42,657 --> 01:07:44,770
elaborate? How do different kinds of

1624
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:46,540
sociality arise and elaborate? And how

1625
01:07:46,557 --> 01:07:48,085
is that associated with the different

1626
01:07:48,117 --> 01:07:50,460
kinds of models structurally changing

1627
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:51,685
that we've been discussing in this

1628
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:54,715
paper? And then just genomics all the

1629
01:07:54,732 --> 01:07:57,310
other stuff gene expression and then

1630
01:07:57,342 --> 01:07:59,785
just one last point, which is the

1631
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:02,137
closing piece of their paper too.

1632
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,410
Finally, it is important to acknowledge

1633
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,990
that brain design bodies ecological and

1634
01:08:08,007 --> 01:08:10,100
cultural niches covolved independently.

1635
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,795
Not sure if that was meant to be meant.

1636
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:14,490
It's kind of like they are codependent

1637
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,115
in brain evolution but they coevolved.

1638
01:08:17,295 --> 01:08:20,365
They were alone together. Given that

1639
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:21,960
here we were interested in the evolution

1640
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,640
of brain designs, we assumed a brain

1641
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,290
centric perspective and conveniently

1642
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,890
focused on generative models in the

1643
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:31,330
animal's brain, hashtag realism in

1644
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:33,420
the brain not modeled as in the brain.

1645
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,365
However, cognition does not need to be

1646
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:37,840
confined in this goal to be it can be

1647
01:08:37,857 --> 01:08:39,415
extended outside it to COVID for

1648
01:08:39,432 --> 01:08:41,460
example, tools and social dimensions,

1649
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:43,925
epistemic niche, niche modification,

1650
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:47,275
digital stigma. Furthermore, the body

1651
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:49,740
design and not just brain design plays

1652
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,325
an important role in solving control

1653
01:08:51,387 --> 01:08:53,760
problems, acknowledging that cognition

1654
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:56,110
niche be extended and embodied and

1655
01:08:56,142 --> 01:08:58,165
encultured, etc. All the least, all the

1656
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,430
other letters suggest that not all

1657
01:09:00,477 --> 01:09:02,485
aspects of control need to be solved by

1658
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:04,560
or represented in a central generative

1659
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:07,465
model. Tail of two densities all the

1660
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:08,755
discussions we've been having about

1661
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:11,560
representation and so it was X and X

1662
01:09:11,592 --> 01:09:13,765
star in the simple version that was

1663
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,610
presented in this paper where it was

1664
01:09:15,642 --> 01:09:17,860
actually. Trying to track X star in the

1665
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:20,830
world with the internal inference. But

1666
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,390
this is the discussion that we've been

1667
01:09:22,407 --> 01:09:25,210
having action, action, action oriented

1668
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:27,235
representation structurally resemble the

1669
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:29,320
world. And there's other papers that

1670
01:09:29,322 --> 01:09:30,540
we've discussed in the last several

1671
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,155
weeks that really touch on that point.

1672
01:09:32,277 --> 01:09:33,915
So how do we think about generative

1673
01:09:33,945 --> 01:09:36,130
model models and factor graphs for

1674
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:38,905
extended cognitive processes? So, a

1675
01:09:38,952 --> 01:09:40,675
couple of books to check out about

1676
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:43,305
extended mind and embodied cognition.

1677
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,535
And then here's a nice figure from touch

1678
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:49,345
points with the brain, the organs in

1679
01:09:49,347 --> 01:09:53,215
the body, the world and the tools and

1680
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:55,140
the epistemic niche and the computer

1681
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,210
like a calculator and time chronos and

1682
01:09:58,242 --> 01:10:01,285
food and then other people social. So

1683
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:03,060
that's like cognition is like a holistic

1684
01:10:03,105 --> 01:10:05,000
interactions of all these features.

1685
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,535
What does embodiment this perspective

1686
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:10,240
have to do with realism and

1687
01:10:10,257 --> 01:10:12,940
instrumentalism and utilitarianism and

1688
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:14,825
other philosophical positions?

1689
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,840
Are people really taking those positions

1690
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,560
or is it just as if they're taking those

1691
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,380
positions? And then what else are you

1692
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,510
really curious about and motivated to

1693
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,390
explore? And how will you modify and

1694
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:31,810
improve your epistemic niche? So I hope

1695
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:35,950
you enjoyed this kind of Solo Zero

1696
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:37,780
video. I think it's been a little bit

1697
01:10:37,827 --> 01:10:41,485
since the Solo Zeros, but just want to

1698
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:44,350
close, as always, with what might a good

1699
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,240
understanding enable? What are the

1700
01:10:46,257 --> 01:10:48,200
unique predictions and implications?

1701
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,380
What are the next steps for free energy

1702
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:51,750
principle, active inference, lab

1703
01:10:51,825 --> 01:10:54,190
research and application? What are the

1704
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,400
goals of this research and what are you

1705
01:10:57,537 --> 01:11:00,055
still curious about? We're going to be

1706
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:03,520
talking about this paper in the coming

1707
01:11:03,597 --> 01:11:06,900
weeks on February 16 and February

1708
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,280
20 free. And so if you'd like to

1709
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:12,700
participate in those discussions through

1710
01:11:12,762 --> 01:11:14,775
live chat or by joining the discussions

1711
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,335
live, just get in contact with us. Hope

1712
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,075
you read this paper because it's very

1713
01:11:19,137 --> 01:11:21,700
thought, provocative and interesting.

1714
01:11:21,837 --> 01:11:25,855
So enjoy the paper and work

1715
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:28,300
through it. Hope to see you in other

1716
01:11:28,362 --> 01:11:31,195
action flow activities. Thanks for

1717
01:11:31,272 --> 01:11:32,805
listening and your regime of attention.
