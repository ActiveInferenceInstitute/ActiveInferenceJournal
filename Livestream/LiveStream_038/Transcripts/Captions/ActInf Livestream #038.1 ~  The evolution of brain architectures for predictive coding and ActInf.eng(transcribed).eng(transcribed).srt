16th 2022

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
welcome to the actin flap we are a

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
at the links on this slide

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,120
this is a recorded and an archived live

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
feedback so that we can improve our work

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
welcome and we'll be following video

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
etiquette for live stream

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,000
just release an unending torrent of

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
emojis if you have to speak or just

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,438
raise your hand i'm sure that we'll get

20
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,640
to it

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
if you're watching live please feel free

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
to write questions in the live chat and

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
we'll have enough time to hang out and

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,799
discuss

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
during this dot one where we'll be

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,000
opening into the paper

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
check out activeinference.org

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
for updated information on participating

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
in any of the labs activities

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
i hope you'll find something that

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
resonates with you

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,320
today in actinf

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,600
livestream number 38.1 we're going to be

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
learning and discussing this cool paper

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
the evolution of brain architectures for

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
predictive coding and active inference

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
by pazulo parr and fristen from

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
december 2021

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,799
and

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,600
we're just going to enjoy discussing it

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
and opening up any ideas or questions

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,640
that us here on the panel have or those

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
who are live chatting us

44
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
and we have some ideas and thoughts

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
prepared a few things that we know that

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
we can go into and also i hope that

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,479
everyone has

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
brought some other prepared seeds and

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,480
also of course

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,720
spontaneously

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
feeling like new things are arising

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,319
so we'll just start with some

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,120
introduction and warm-up we can each say

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
hi and then maybe it'd be cool to just

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,680
also mention like what

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
got you excited about the paper or what

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
made you want to discuss this paper

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
what's something that stayed

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
with you

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
california and

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
i was very excited by the evolutionary

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
focus

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
a lot of my

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
research over the last years has been in

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
evolution in ecology so it's always

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
awesome to see how people are thinking

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
about how active inference free energy

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,879
principle and evolutionary studies can

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
all be learning from one another and

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,760
i'll pass to stephen

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
hello i'm stephen silly i'm in toronto

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
um i'm really interested in how this

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,159
paper connects to my work with

75
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
spatial meaning making and social

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,920
topographies

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
because this paper talks about

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
a more biological

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
nascent

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
stage of development rather than some

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
higher order meaning

82
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
often people think about and i'm really

83
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
interested in how this sort of grounded

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
bottom up

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
inactive ecological approaches can be

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239
thought about as something where we can

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
actually

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
ground a lot of our meaning making and

89
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,840
so i'm interested in how this

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
might match with some of that thinking

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
and i will pass this over to dean

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
thanks steven i'm dean i'm in calgary uh

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,920
what i found interesting about the paper

94
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,879
is that

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
given that i've worked with a lot of

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,280
young learners for a lot of my life

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,879
i

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,720
was really it was really interesting to

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,519
see

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,480
how

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,439
this

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,680
affirmed a lot of the thinking that i

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
was doing when i was trying to get

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
people past the idea that science is

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
only about the biology and the chemistry

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
and the physics that there is a

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
statistical and predictive component to

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
this and those relationships in that in

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
that realm um can build certain sense of

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
what the

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
underlying architecture is so as i said

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
this is this is a lot of this is

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
affirmations and it's kind of it's it's

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
kind of seen as being

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
not part of what is typically addressed

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
as core learning but i think it should

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
be back to you dan

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
cool nice intro let's just start with a

119
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
big question

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
and then

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
either of you have any reflections on

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
the big question

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
or we'll go over to blank slide and just

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,080
bring up some

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,440
questions we have

126
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,199
and also it might be good to go over

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
just some of the key points in the paper

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
like what did they actually do in terms

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,960
of their contribution

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
so the big question or at least one way

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,360
to phrase something that might bring

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,840
someone to approach this paper

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,880
what is the evolutionary

134
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,560
neurophysiological basis of cognition

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
and how do complex cognitive phenotypes

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
arise like you don't go from zero to

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
colony in one time step

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
how does it happen that evolution arises

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
from precursor

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
sometimes simpler but also sometimes

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
more complicated

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
precursors

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
steven mentioned like what is the basis

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
for sense making and cognition and sense

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
making are very related

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
and what's been fun over these

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,600
last weeks

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
and months is we've explored

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
basic

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,639
or simple or reduced or basal cognition

151
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,280
from a variety of perspectives like we

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
talked about the bioelectric components

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,960
of

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
thinking about basal cognition with mike

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,759
levin now we're thinking about a

156
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,199
slightly different

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
approach to understanding basal

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
cognition which we'll be discussing here

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
and then also we've looked at some of

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,360
these more complex cognitive phenotypes

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,080
like

162
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
mental action counterfactuals

163
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
deep

164
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
temporal inference

165
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,919
all the abductive

166
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
logic which we'll get into probably

167
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,039
later

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
um

169
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
how can we use integrative models of

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
perception cognition action and impact

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
like active inference

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
to study this whole continuum and

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
diversity of relatively simpler

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,400
in our perspective cognition and also

175
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
relatively more complex

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
cognitive phenotypes

177
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,440
and everything in between so yes stephen

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
and then on with it

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
thanks daniel yeah i mean i suppose also

180
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
what what some of the paradigm

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
impacts of that of taking that

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
all the way through um and one question

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
that might come up which you may or may

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
not have an answer to or thoughts on but

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
um you know mike

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
levin's work with the

187
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
tediological cones

188
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
at the different nested levels and how

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
this sort of

190
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
could be thinking about what kind of

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
um action

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
control potential

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
you know in in these different nested

194
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,080
levels might exist

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
um i would be interested to think about

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
how this may um

197
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
either be able to connect to that i can

198
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
see it connecting philosophically or

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
whether there's another bridge needed

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
between this modeling and that type of

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,119
modelling so just something i'll mention

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
great

203
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
um

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,479
dean anything to add or perhaps i'm

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
gonna wait till you get to uh figure one

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
okay

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
so

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
we won't go through

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
all of the

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
binary points in the paper that's

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
for the reading of the paper itself nor

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
will we even go over all of the overview

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
which is what the dot zero video 38.0 is

214
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
for so you know turn back time and watch

215
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
that one if you haven't or pause the

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
video if you're not watching it live

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
but

218
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
what this paper does

219
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,400
as evidenced by their roadmap

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
is

221
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
introduce a few basic principles of

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
cognition

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,599
predictive regulation and control

224
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
and then also

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,839
structure learning in generative models

226
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
that's not how every neurophysiology

227
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
text is going to begin

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
the building blocks of cognition it's

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
not how every evolutionary

230
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
neurophysiology text is going to be

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,519
framing cognition but that's what they

232
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
do here and that will play into how it's

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,279
similar and different than other

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
approaches

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
then with those building blocks in hand

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,800
or on the floor

237
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
they provide three examples of motifs

238
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
that ancestral brains

239
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
may

240
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
be modeled as having or may have

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
actually had

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
with those three examples in hand

243
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
it's then possible for them to state

244
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
a more general way of thinking about the

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,560
transitions amongst different structures

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
these structures represent

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
brain design as structure learning in

248
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
generative models

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
that is called an evolutionary algebra

250
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
and they introduce

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,320
five operators that can basically either

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
leave unchanged or

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
change

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
the structure

255
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
of brain design

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
with respect to generative models

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
and each of those are explored in terms

258
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
of what are the architectural changes

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
that that evolutionary transition

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
is

261
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
and then what are the functional

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
consequences of that kind of an

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
evolutionary transition

264
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
then they have some discussions about

265
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,279
how

266
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
sequences or patterns of application of

267
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
this evolutionary algebra could lead to

268
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
different evolutionary phenomena so

269
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
for example increasing temporal depth in

270
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
the future means that models are

271
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
increasingly prospective

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
increasing temporal depth in the past is

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
like memory etc

274
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
and then they close with

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
mapping to a phylogenetic tree and

276
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,959
thinking about

277
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
that evolutionary algebra of state

278
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
transitions being mapped onto the

279
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
bifurcating tree structure that's called

280
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
the phylogenetic tree which shows the

281
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
relatedness of different

282
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
life forms

283
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
um

284
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
that's the roadmap

285
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,720
let's go to the long-awaited figure one

286
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
and talk about the action perception

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
cycle and predictive regulation and so

288
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
they're again discussing this in the

289
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
context of predictive regulation

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
anticipatory regulation cybernetics

291
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,279
and control

292
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
as a basic design principle for the

293
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,399
brain

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,880
so dean what do you see here or what

295
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
would be cool to think about

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
so what did this follows i think is is

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
the usual pattern when we're trying to

298
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,519
uh

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
explain where we're going to go

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
and so you just had a road map up and i

301
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
think a road map is a way

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
for the people who are reading the road

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
map to find their way what i think what

304
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,079
this diagram

305
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
shows is that in that in the middle of

306
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
there there's something called a

307
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,640
discrepancy

308
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
and that discrepancy is later going to

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
be given up given a label y

310
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
um and

311
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,680
what i think is really interesting here

312
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
is there's a there's a flip potentially

313
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
that can happen here that discrepancy is

314
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
where what i would describe as a rule

315
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
factory

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,839
and rule in the sense that we find

317
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,639
patterns

318
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
that's kind of our place where where as

319
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
it says the prediction and the

320
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
observation come together and i believe

321
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
that that's different than a road map

322
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
which is find your way i believe that

323
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
that discrepancy of that rule factory is

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
way binding and i think

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
what we have the potential to do with

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
this paper

327
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,240
because of the way that they

328
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
have sort of presented the information

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,519
is

330
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,040
the words

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
become x

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,120
eventually become

333
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,760
explicated rules which then become

334
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
action in the phenomenological space

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,279
that's where it gets really really

336
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
interesting because i think most of the

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,160
time when people look at things as a

338
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
subject they've taken the world

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
and they've collapsed down to words and

340
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,079
diagrams and models what this

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,120
potentially allows us to do is flip that

342
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
and move from the words back out into

343
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,240
the

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,760
space

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
with a little bit more confidence so

346
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,519
yeah that's why i wanted to kind of

347
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,880
start here

348
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
because i think the word discrepancy

349
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
it's the first time i've seen it in this

350
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
kind of figure

351
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,480
model and i really like it

352
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,279
cool

353
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,160
yeah it makes me think about uh

354
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
setting off on the road trip on the

355
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
mental actions that

356
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,839
reflect

357
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,120
the paper

358
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
and there's the road map which is super

359
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
informative but it is like

360
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
instructionalism it's saying you're

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
going to go two streets and then take a

362
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,079
left turn at the stop sign and then when

363
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
this happens then you'll do that and if

364
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,519
you've seen this then you've gone too

365
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,240
far kind of classic instruction

366
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,040
type

367
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
sequences

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
here we have a figuring out because it's

369
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,199
visually arranged with some local

370
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,440
connectivity that's suggestive of a

371
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
causal connection through time but

372
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
by no means is there only one way to

373
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
read this simultaneous figure

374
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,240
and

375
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
so that allows

376
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
potentially for more of a figuring out

377
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
including the figuring out of rules

378
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
yes it is indeed a little different with

379
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
discrepancy at the intersection here

380
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
stephen

381
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
yeah so this ties in with

382
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
the lower bound evidence

383
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,800
um

384
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
control approach on of action so you

385
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
know the idea is that

386
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
action is what we can

387
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,079
tractably approximate

388
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,040
um

389
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
and

390
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
perception is

391
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
uh something that we can access but

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
can't

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
and we can try to make more sense of but

394
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
is is is a harder

395
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,440
a harder uh

396
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
piece of the equation to get together to

397
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,519
get a handle on so um i'm wondering if

398
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,480
that's

399
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,199
i mean how do you feel about that

400
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
decoration in terms of

401
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
its its use across

402
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
other areas of applied active inference

403
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,560
so i think it's a

404
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,440
it could make things a little bit more

405
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,920
digestible for a number of contexts

406
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
okay i'm

407
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
thinking about this in the context of

408
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
recognizing that it's different than

409
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,839
other action perception loops that we've

410
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,519
seen which is just really important to

411
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
keep in mind that we're not

412
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
perceiving something that we're

413
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,199
projecting too much

414
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,480
because

415
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,800
other times the outgoing arrow from the

416
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
entity is what

417
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
if this were a markov blanket type

418
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,519
diagram which they often are

419
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,800
the outgoing arrow would reflect active

420
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
states and then the statistical

421
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
dependencies that are outgoing

422
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,959
but where is action

423
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
it's on the bottom right

424
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
so

425
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,560
let's really try to understand why the

426
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
pieces are placed this way

427
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,199
the outgoing feature of the cognitive

428
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,000
entity is the prediction

429
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,399
and here's observation coming in if this

430
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,040
were a markov blanket diagram we'd have

431
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,320
the world

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,959
and then the incoming statistical arrow

433
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
would be the observation that would be

434
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
the sensory states

435
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
so

436
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,519
here

437
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
it's the outgoing prediction of the

438
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,480
entity and the incoming sensory data or

439
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
observation

440
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
those two are being

441
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
differentiated

442
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
to form a discrepancy

443
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,639
which is just a qualitative term but it

444
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,680
could be

445
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,600
then brought a little bit more formally

446
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
into a prediction error

447
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,199
or

448
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
a little bit even beyond that into like

449
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
a free energy differential

450
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
this

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
discrepancy

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
has two arrows coming out of it

453
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
from the discrepancy

454
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,440
is

455
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
a rising perception

456
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,240
and the changing of beliefs

457
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
does perception always involve changing

458
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
beliefs

459
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
and the discrepancy is also giving rise

460
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,519
to action

461
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,559
so what kind of a thing is discrepancy

462
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,559
such that the inputs are prediction and

463
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,000
observation

464
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,919
and the outputs are perception and

465
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,599
action

466
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
so at the very least this is not the

467
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
bayesian graph representations that

468
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,199
we've seen before

469
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
or that we'll see

470
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
in just a few slides with a more

471
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
traditional interpretation of nodes as

472
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
random variables and edges as

473
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
statistical dependencies

474
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,799
this is a little bit more like a thought

475
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,559
map

476
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,360
that then connects to

477
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
the variational free energy equation

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
which we talked about in number 37 a lot

479
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,840
more but just

480
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
to recall there's the red and the blue

481
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
lines

482
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
these two different components

483
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
of the variational free energy and those

484
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
are shown again here so check out 37 to

485
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
learn more about the red and the blue

486
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
and about

487
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
variational and expected free energy but

488
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
for here

489
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
we're starting with this

490
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,240
action prediction discrepancy

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,919
motif

492
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
and then connecting it

493
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
to perception and action as variational

494
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,799
free energy minimization stephen

495
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
i think one thing that's useful with

496
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
this

497
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
more nascent

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,520
representation is this discrepancy

499
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,039
can go in different

500
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,480
different directions so it can be

501
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
discrepancy in terms of temporal

502
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,480
occurrence

503
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
when was the prediction predicted to

504
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,600
happen

505
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
when was it observed but it could also

506
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,400
be what kind of prediction

507
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
and what kind of observation or

508
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
whereabouts was the prediction

509
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
whereabouts was the observation there's

510
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
many different

511
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
um and at different scales you know so

512
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
there may be

513
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
that um

514
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
at the kind of lower levels there's

515
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
quite a big jump between

516
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
when i predict

517
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
the baseball coming to my hand

518
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,600
when that prediction was made when that

519
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,879
observation occurs

520
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
and also when that is

521
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
chained up at different

522
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
slower bigger steps of the

523
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
um nested markov

524
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
blanket sort of sequence so you this

525
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,559
idea of discrepancy is uh

526
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
i suppose is probably the biggest bucket

527
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
they could find i would imagine at that

528
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
at that spot and that may be partly why

529
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
it's there

530
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,720
can i just add to that stephen i think

531
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
one of the things that's interesting is

532
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
especially after just doing the 37 paper

533
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
where we were talking about guides

534
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
to me

535
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,919
the timing of this was absolutely

536
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
immaculate because now all of a sudden

537
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
we've gone from guiding to almost taking

538
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
potentially a referee's position

539
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
on the world

540
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
which is a whole different thing than

541
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
than taking the taking up the position

542
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
of being a guide

543
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
and that was i mean that that's not

544
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,720
nuance that's not subtle

545
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,559
that's quite quite an identity shift and

546
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,679
we're going to actually get into

547
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,760
identity when we look at some of the

548
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,480
evolutionary steps later on but i i

549
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
wanted to slow down on this because i

550
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
thought

551
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
this that's not that's not a minor

552
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
change

553
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
that's a whole different perspective

554
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
shift and i think we need to really make

555
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,159
note of that because i think it colors

556
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
a lot of what's to follow

557
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
what makes you say that we're a referee

558
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
in this situation

559
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
discrepancy

560
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
there's a difference between what what

561
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
the world is telling us and then how we

562
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
rule on them

563
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
so think of any game where you get into

564
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,520
an argument with the refs

565
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
are they wrong are you wrong it doesn't

566
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
really matter the point is that there's

567
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
a difference

568
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
that's when you said differential

569
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
graphing is maybe one of the ways to be

570
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
able to make that explicit

571
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
but that's not how it's typically

572
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
framed out

573
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,039
when we're talking about bayesian or

574
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,720
markovian stuff

575
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
so i think this is i think this is a big

576
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,840
move

577
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,320
i know it might seem like a tiny one but

578
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
i think as we go again as we go deeper

579
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
into this paper it affirms a lot of the

580
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
stuff that i actually saw when you're

581
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,039
trying to go out there

582
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,640
and forage

583
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,919
and figure

584
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,880
so

585
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
i'm excited to keep going

586
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
yeah it could be like the observation

587
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
the the baseball player is running

588
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
towards the base

589
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
and the coach is observing and there's

590
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,200
this ongoing prediction and observation

591
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
with no discrepancy because part of the

592
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
generative model includes the person

593
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
moving through time

594
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
and then

595
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
given the observation and the generative

596
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,880
model

597
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,559
the coach predicts slash expects and

598
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,159
prefers which will

599
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,440
come to you again later with the three

600
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,320
piece

601
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,799
um that the baseball player is safe you

602
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
rarely see um

603
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
super animated refusals when a call has

604
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
gone towards somebody but it's when it

605
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
has gone against it's violated their

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
fitness that there's a discrepancy

607
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
with what the referee has called and

608
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
what the interested coach has called

609
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,600
and that is going to lead to

610
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
some consequences and again we're still

611
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
not at the bayesian graph

612
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
level but that's going to be the next

613
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,559
figure stephen

614
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
this can then

615
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
build on

616
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
the idea of what's cognitive what what

617
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
can you have a perspective on so i think

618
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
what you're saying there with this

619
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
referee position is

620
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
as well as the kind of

621
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
the swarming dynamics and the kind of

622
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
inactive processes much of which is

623
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
beyond our

624
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,799
ability to sense or

625
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,240
integrate

626
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
what is it once it starts to hit what's

627
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
the big bucket at the kind of cognition

628
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
level that still isn't

629
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,280
too much of a

630
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,280
a um an inflation

631
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,240
so in this case here discrepancy there

632
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
is a sense of being able to distinguish

633
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
perception and action at some level and

634
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,840
find a discrepancy which in some

635
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,080
ways i would imagine covers a lot of

636
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
what cognition would require to be

637
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,880
thought of in a cognition way

638
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,600
other types of action for instance how

639
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
we heal

640
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
or grow

641
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
maybe um action and perception won't be

642
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,679
so separated but this is trying to come

643
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,240
up the idea of cognition so maybe that

644
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,000
also informs this process

645
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
cool so section two again was just about

646
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
the two concepts of

647
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
predictive regulation and control that's

648
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,200
what we saw here

649
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
predictive

650
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,919
and control

651
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,279
so it's just conceptually laid out

652
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,039
in figure 2

653
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,440
they formalize brain design

654
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
as structured learning in generative

655
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
models

656
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,039
so here we have a different figure

657
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
we still have

658
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,840
the

659
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
cognitive entity

660
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
and the world

661
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,480
we add in

662
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
one layer of

663
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,600
absolutely essential active terms which

664
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
is generative model

665
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
generative process

666
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,279
the generative model is the cognitive

667
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
entities model of

668
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,400
the generative process

669
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
is the underlying phenomena that gives

670
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,440
rise to observations

671
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,559
it's the difference between the

672
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,960
cognitive model of vision a generative

673
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
model of vision

674
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
and the generative process of visual

675
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
input which is like

676
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,440
photons and the sun and all of that so

677
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
these are very different they're

678
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,279
complementary

679
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
but just so that we're really clear

680
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,159
going forward that we're going to be

681
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
using those in their specific sense not

682
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
using them like oh well it's a

683
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,960
generative model because this is a model

684
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
of cognition that makes me excited and

685
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,799
think of ideas that's not how we're

686
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,120
using generative model here so just to

687
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,039
be clear on that

688
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,080
now

689
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
we see

690
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,159
action

691
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
as changing the world represented by you

692
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
and the cognition involves partially

693
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,400
action selection

694
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
policy selection

695
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
planning as inference

696
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,960
but

697
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,440
not going to all those details yet

698
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,400
which can have some influence on

699
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,559
actual unobserved hidden states the

700
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,200
world x star

701
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,240
x

702
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
is the cognitive model

703
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
of that hidden state of the world that

704
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,400
is

705
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,240
being inferred

706
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,520
and y

707
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
is the observation that then feeds back

708
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,320
into the cognitive model

709
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,919
so that's what these

710
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,919
nodes mean

711
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,200
it's about

712
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
partitioning

713
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,200
the cognitive model

714
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
from the generative process

715
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
separating the generative model from the

716
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,159
generative process

717
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,320
and we're starting to see

718
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,120
the traditional blanket form with

719
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,600
observations having incoming statistical

720
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,799
dependencies

721
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
and actions having outgoing statistical

722
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
dependencies

723
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,919
what else do either of you see in this

724
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
model

725
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
yatine

726
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
hey let's see

727
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
so

728
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
let's go back to being a referee for a

729
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
second

730
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
the assumption is that you're already

731
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,440
attending

732
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
and most of these models that that we

733
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
have

734
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,159
taken up in the past

735
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
especially in 37

736
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
what they try to focus on is

737
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
getting from a to b

738
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,600
what this is essentially saying is

739
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
let's add something to that translation

740
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
right from a to b

741
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,919
whatever we're trying to incorporate in

742
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,240
this representation let's maybe look at

743
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
the interpretation part of it now and

744
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,240
the recitation part of it so if i'm the

745
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
umpire and we can all be umpires we

746
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,559
don't have to do that just in a baseball

747
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,440
game

748
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
this is incorporating now a certain

749
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
critical process

750
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,960
i was attending and i saw this but then

751
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,600
there were 60 000 other people also

752
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
paying attention

753
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
and they saw that

754
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
that's where i think it this is getting

755
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,520
really interesting now this is actually

756
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
bringing it back to sort of i still

757
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,399
think it's an instrumental piece but i

758
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,000
think now we're going to incorporate

759
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,320
some of the reality and is where the

760
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,000
sixty thousand wrong

761
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
or is the one person who yelled out

762
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,760
safe

763
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
wrong

764
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,000
that's what i see in this because that

765
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,679
you is is definitely embedded in

766
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
the generative process

767
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,840
not the generative model

768
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,439
okay thanks dean stephen

769
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
so the

770
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,640
question that comes into mind is where

771
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,399
the body is in all of this

772
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,960
and i sense that

773
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,039
the generative processes the bigger

774
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
process with the world the generative

775
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
model

776
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
um gives a way to access those

777
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,200
priors and and to give away the hidden

778
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
states

779
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,279
and the cognitive model

780
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
generally speaking cognition is thought

781
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,200
of more in terms of deductive and

782
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
inductive

783
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
reasoning and logic

784
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,679
and and it could be that the

785
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,559
that there's elements of the abductive

786
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
that could be held within

787
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
the kind of body and i suppose there's a

788
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
question there

789
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,120
um that

790
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,039
to how and where that is i don't think

791
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
anyone quite knows the answer to that

792
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,679
but uh

793
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,520
um that's that's my thought

794
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,799
so let's

795
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,559
remember that this

796
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
partitioning

797
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,000
is specific to a given instantiation of

798
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
model-based science

799
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,399
just like majeed was talking about

800
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,120
so we're not going around and assigning

801
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
aspects or phenomena of the world into

802
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
either generative model or generative

803
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,200
process so where does the body fit in

804
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,000
well

805
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
with respect to a model

806
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
of the body being a structurally real

807
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
thing that gives rise to

808
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,919
observations it's a generative process

809
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,919
looking at the coin from the other side

810
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,000
and thinking of the body

811
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,279
as a generative model of its niche

812
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,440
doing inference on certain things or

813
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
acting as if in that sense it's

814
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
generative model so

815
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,960
different kinds of entities are not

816
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
going to be just assigned simply to one

817
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,799
side or the other

818
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
it's going to come down to what is

819
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,080
specifically being discussed

820
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
there's a few other um

821
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
not complexifiers but first off just

822
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,120
note that the no the notation here is

823
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
not the same that's used elsewhere

824
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,640
so we will move towards better and

825
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,039
cleaner or reformatable notation but

826
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
like x star

827
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,279
as a external state and x as an internal

828
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,399
state

829
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,279
might be clearer for some people

830
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
it also carries a little bit of a

831
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,919
baggage that the hidden state is exactly

832
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,000
what is being inferred about the

833
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
external world

834
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
like there's a temperature parameter in

835
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,480
the brain and then there's a temperature

836
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,200
parameter outside in the world

837
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,279
as we explore in the representations

838
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,320
paper

839
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
it doesn't necessarily have to be that

840
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
way there could be

841
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
in a hidden state internally having to

842
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,320
do with movement left or right

843
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,919
and then there's a temperature variable

844
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,120
outside

845
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,799
and then the model

846
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,120
the generative model of the cognizer is

847
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
about movement conditioned on

848
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
temperature observations but not

849
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,200
necessarily

850
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
simply a thermometer being

851
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,640
instantiated in the head so

852
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,840
it's like

853
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,720
good to look at this graphically and

854
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
think about what is being connected to

855
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
what without

856
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,039
worrying

857
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,200
too much about all of these

858
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,039
side questions but

859
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,640
this is what they're setting up as the

860
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
basis of their further discussion

861
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,519
which is it's about prediction and

862
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,360
control

863
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,600
and we can use bayesian graphical

864
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,158
approaches to represent that stephen

865
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
and that inferred state as you mentioned

866
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
it's uh in some ways that's always

867
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
slightly hidden from us like how is that

868
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
what is that mean to be an inferred

869
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,080
state

870
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,720
in terms of is that the cognition

871
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
that's coming out of that in some sort

872
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,799
of deductive

873
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,360
or can it be an effective

874
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,799
sense of how well something's going so

875
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
again it's not

876
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,720
directly asked here

877
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,799
but

878
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,320
accessing that is one of the big

879
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
problems that happens is how do you

880
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
access

881
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,320
what has been inferred

882
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,240
when it's not necessarily something you

883
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,600
can access through

884
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,159
sort of direct reporting from a

885
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
subject matter or from a from

886
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
participant

887
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,000
right like another example of that might

888
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,640
be somebody who has skilled action with

889
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
respect to investing

890
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
but they may not be able to give an

891
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,960
estimate for a number that's a certain

892
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
you know asset is expected to be at

893
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,799
because it's not like they're doing the

894
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,200
asset price prediction and then doing a

895
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,519
strategy the cognitive model may have a

896
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
very different structure

897
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,480
so

898
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
we explored it in the representations

899
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
paper but like there would be ways in

900
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
which therefore that investment decision

901
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,360
is not a representation

902
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,600
of the actual stock market

903
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
because it's not the same variable

904
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,799
but then the aboutness of the investment

905
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,799
decision would be

906
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,279
a representation with respect to what

907
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,880
was happening in the generative process

908
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,120
so those were some of the like

909
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,399
side avenues that we've looked at

910
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
previously but they're all in play at

911
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,279
once

912
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,039
and so the question is just how to

913
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
linearly structure

914
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,360
to respect the specific contributions

915
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
that are made here

916
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
and the insight that can be gleaned

917
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
without um

918
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
every single time

919
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,559
pulling back to some of these questions

920
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,840
but it's great that we have like

921
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,039
specific papers and memes and core terms

922
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,320
that we can

923
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,000
refer to

924
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,120
and then

925
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
carry on with what they actually

926
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,960
contribute

927
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,519
okay any thoughts on one or two before

928
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,399
we get into the

929
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
structure of the um

930
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,960
aloe stat

931
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,399
or the homeostat first i guess

932
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,240
let's go

933
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,679
okay again so

934
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,679
we're going to go from this black and

935
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,200
white you know

936
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
dorothy still in kansas

937
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,440
mode

938
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,399
to

939
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,600
some predictive motifs of ancestral

940
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
brains

941
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,320
and the three motifs the red green and

942
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,679
blue

943
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,480
are

944
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
homeostasis

945
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,679
so returning to a set point allostasis

946
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
anticipating or approaching a set point

947
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,079
in the future which could be a fixed or

948
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,280
changing one

949
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,320
and then implementing behavioral control

950
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,399
not just

951
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,040
scalar homeostasis or allostasis on an

952
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,000
enteroceptive variable

953
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,679
okay

954
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
citation 20 in the paper chance at all

955
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,760
from the future march 22

956
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,599
is where to look for more details on the

957
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,918
homeostatic formulation that they're

958
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,280
using here

959
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
but we can see it in terms of their

960
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,040
figure three

961
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
okay so the left side just for reference

962
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
there's figure two

963
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,199
so that we can remember the structure of

964
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,680
perception cognition action impact that

965
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
the authors are working with here

966
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
and we're gonna connect this black and

967
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,280
white figure 2

968
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,320
to

969
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
figure 3a

970
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,040
this is a graphical model

971
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,200
graphical in both senses meaning visual

972
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
like we're perceiving it through

973
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
computer graphics and graphical meaning

974
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,400
like a network so nodes and edges

975
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
because there's computer graphics that

976
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
aren't

977
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,960
network topologies

978
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,640
but this happens to be a computer

979
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
graphic that we're perceiving visually

980
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,960
that also is reflecting a graph in terms

981
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
of nodes and connected edges

982
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,760
it's a generative model

983
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,280
for

984
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,440
the regulation of a single interceptive

985
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,359
variable so here's a and b with the

986
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,960
homeostat and c we split out to talk

987
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,160
about later but first a and b

988
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
this generative model includes an

989
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,760
enteroceptive thermoreceptor

990
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,040
and a belief about body temperature

991
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
the prior over x

992
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,599
which is body temperature is kept fixed

993
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,760
and hence it acts as a cybernetic set

994
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
point

995
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,359
any discrepancy between the predictive

996
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,280
thermoreceptor activity given beliefs

997
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
about x so y conditioned on x

998
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
and the measured y is registered as a

999
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,480
prediction error that is canceled out by

1000
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,280
an autonomic response u for example a

1001
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,000
thermoregulatory response so

1002
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
hidden state

1003
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
on temperature beliefs about temperature

1004
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,040
y

1005
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,800
the thermometer

1006
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
perception

1007
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,359
and then

1008
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,480
there's the selection of action so some

1009
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,119
sort of like vasodilation or

1010
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,560
thermoregulatory response

1011
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,839
and then that's going to change the

1012
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,680
underlying unobserved true temperature

1013
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
but that's not um

1014
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,599
needing to be shown so any comments on

1015
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,119
that first part we're looking just at

1016
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
the top half of 3a

1017
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,040
and connecting x y

1018
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,560
to um

1019
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,440
you action

1020
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,880
can you still hear me because i yeah

1021
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
can you take can you take the cursor now

1022
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
and just reinforce

1023
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,119
the feedback and the feed forward part

1024
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,720
of this because the authors spent a bit

1025
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,320
i don't want it sort of

1026
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,400
unpacked like they have at the at the

1027
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,839
figure three unpacking that we have in

1028
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,440
the bottom of the slide can you just run

1029
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,839
the cursor over all the examples of

1030
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
feedback and feed forward

1031
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,839
going on concurrently because i think

1032
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,680
that's that's

1033
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
really important to see

1034
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,599
that it's happening in both directions

1035
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,359
at once

1036
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,640
let's label

1037
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,079
everything

1038
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
and then definitely can do that

1039
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,839
perfect thank you

1040
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,599
okay so

1041
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,280
light blue

1042
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
is action

1043
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,520
these are subtracted so red circles

1044
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
represent expected

1045
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,839
values

1046
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
of x

1047
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,520
the red circles

1048
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,680
are used to make predictions about y

1049
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,480
these are subtracted to form a

1050
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,440
prediction error

1051
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,560
because those lines with the arrows on

1052
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,240
the end of them are just dependencies

1053
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
they don't really show

1054
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,359
both the feedback and the feed forward

1055
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,280
yes agreed like having some

1056
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,880
rounded

1057
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
edges and other

1058
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,839
um directed edges

1059
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,280
let's see whether it's

1060
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
whether they're like kind or not

1061
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,598
um

1062
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
let's start with action

1063
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
action

1064
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,320
influences the state of the world

1065
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,560
which

1066
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,520
an edge can be drawn

1067
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,320
to how that changes the state of the

1068
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
thermoreceptor

1069
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,440
i thought why here was the observation

1070
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,640
yeah

1071
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
that's the state of the thermoreceptor

1072
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,880
is the observation okay yeah so action

1073
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
changes the observation the state of the

1074
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,880
thermoreceptor

1075
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,839
um

1076
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,520
which is

1077
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
being contrasted

1078
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,720
with the belief about temperature

1079
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
yes from there

1080
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,720
a prediction error

1081
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,000
is generated

1082
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,599
it could be zero if there's no

1083
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,520
difference or it could be higher

1084
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,200
that can you can you just show with a

1085
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,079
green

1086
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,560
some colored line that has an arrow on

1087
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,240
each end

1088
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,880
a connection that demonstrates within

1089
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,599
that diagram the feedback and the feed

1090
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,920
forward at once

1091
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,599
is that possible using this diagram

1092
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,760
let's see it's this representation so a

1093
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,720
single arrow that a single line that has

1094
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
an arrow at both ends is a different

1095
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
color so we've superimposed it over this

1096
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,119
but that it shows that there's a

1097
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
feedback feed forward loop going off

1098
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,640
at the same time

1099
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,160
okay so here's the temperature

1100
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,119
information measurement flowing in to

1101
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,599
contrast with the beliefs

1102
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,520
and this is it is in general really

1103
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,440
important to label the edges not just

1104
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,839
use color

1105
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,440
coding we'll let it roll for now the

1106
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,880
information's flowing from the

1107
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,920
measurement

1108
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,680
to the belief

1109
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,079
and then that

1110
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,280
gives us

1111
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,240
the prediction error

1112
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
the prediction error

1113
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,800
is used

1114
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,839
in the selection of action

1115
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
which then influences

1116
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,440
future observations

1117
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,960
now the red circles represent expected

1118
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,920
values of x

1119
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,119
i'm actually not sure what exactly the

1120
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,160
red

1121
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,160
bottom larger circle is meaning

1122
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
because the prediction error

1123
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,160
well there has to be some way of

1124
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,880
representing that discrepancy right

1125
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,000
so they needed they needed the second

1126
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
ball on the bottom to show difference

1127
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
like between prediction error and

1128
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,400
expectation i think that's all that's

1129
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
trying to show

1130
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,040
yeah or another

1131
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,520
possibility might be that the prior

1132
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,440
is staying fixed

1133
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,760
that's actually music

1134
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,200
yeah priors can also

1135
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,640
they can be

1136
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,480
flexible but in this case it's a fixed

1137
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,839
prior

1138
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,040
that's because we're talking about

1139
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,200
homeostasis

1140
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,280
then

1141
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,119
the observations

1142
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,359
are diverging from

1143
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,359
the prior

1144
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,520
and the posterior

1145
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,200
is kind of like the realized perception

1146
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,280
which is a compromise between the

1147
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
sensory data coming in

1148
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
and the prior

1149
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,079
and so yes there's a lot of degrees of

1150
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,839
freedom depending on how parameters are

1151
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,440
weighted this green line might

1152
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,839
approximate the red a lot more sharply

1153
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,480
we'd call that a weaker prior because

1154
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
sensory data updates the posterior to be

1155
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,200
more like it

1156
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,079
or

1157
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
it could be the case that

1158
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,839
having a lot of observations different

1159
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,359
from your prior don't change it that's a

1160
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,400
strong prior where sensory data do not

1161
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
change it as much but then here

1162
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,119
is the prediction error

1163
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,160
in

1164
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,920
relationship to

1165
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
x i i don't know we can look at the

1166
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,839
paper but is mu

1167
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,319
shown in an equation i don't have it

1168
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,920
copied out if it is

1169
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,680
let me look here while you're doing that

1170
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,640
yeah

1171
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,400
but that is the

1172
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
perhaps here okay

1173
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,240
um stephen anything

1174
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,319
yeah i'm just noting how

1175
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,640
the effectively the belief on

1176
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,880
temperature

1177
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,280
it's it flows through

1178
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,680
the thermosector

1179
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,200
down into the

1180
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,280
to get the expectation and prediction

1181
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
error so it's

1182
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,359
you know it's it's it's like you've

1183
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,359
shown there there is a

1184
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,880
a

1185
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
dynamic going down from

1186
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,280
the belief through to prediction error

1187
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,560
being mediated it's like the

1188
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,400
thermoceptor is kind of like a mediator

1189
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,920
between belief

1190
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,830
and

1191
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,480
[Music]

1192
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
prediction error on what to do for

1193
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,480
action

1194
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,839
and another point i

1195
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,480
the reason why you can't find the mu is

1196
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,960
because it's not actually

1197
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
pointed to in the description

1198
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,200
yeah and i remember reading and looking

1199
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
at looking and looking and not being

1200
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,920
able to find it and then looping back up

1201
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,359
up paper

1202
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,599
to go okay so

1203
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,359
how about feedback feed forward

1204
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,400
now there are cases where vue is used to

1205
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,760
describe internal states

1206
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,960
that may be implicitly how it's being

1207
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,760
used but it's super important that all

1208
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,079
variables are defined in a paper i wish

1209
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,640
they all had a table for every single

1210
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,960
variable and expression that were used

1211
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
yeah it would make the dot zeros easier

1212
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,280
but also it would reduce uncertainty

1213
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
um

1214
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,520
for example is um

1215
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,599
is this epsilon even described okay

1216
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,880
steven

1217
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,119
i mean i suppose in a thermostat in some

1218
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,480
ways the

1219
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,040
the internal states um

1220
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,359
of the bioelectric strip

1221
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,560
and in some ways it's kind of um

1222
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,359
it holds the kind of

1223
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,119
the the way that

1224
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,720
um

1225
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,560
the expectations of action can happen

1226
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,880
because in some ways it dictates the way

1227
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,760
that

1228
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,119
um

1229
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,280
the thermostat will behave

1230
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,599
it's uh in some sort of ways even if

1231
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,000
it's kind of a

1232
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,839
an

1233
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,200
analog uh process so i'm i'm thinking

1234
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
like where where would the kind of in a

1235
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,280
thermostat where would um i know this is

1236
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,200
a homeostat so it's a bit more

1237
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,760
sophisticated now but extrapolating that

1238
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,319
out you've you've kind of got a belief

1239
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,280
and

1240
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,680
there's a belief of what something is

1241
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,920
and then there's an expectation of what

1242
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,599
you can do about it

1243
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,680
um for instance i my beliefs can go

1244
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,800
bigger than what i can do in my actions

1245
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
i could have beliefs about

1246
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,359
temperature which exceeds where

1247
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,480
i could even exist or where i am able to

1248
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,079
change it you know it depends on the

1249
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,760
scenario so

1250
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,839
there's it's sort of held in in both

1251
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,440
scenarios in in both the body

1252
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
and the context and the kind of

1253
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,960
the the the probabilities available

1254
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,720
okay so for a

1255
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,680
non-living thermostat

1256
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
it doesn't have a cognitive belief on

1257
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
temperature but there could be something

1258
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
that's computationally like that

1259
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,040
reflected by like just a digital prior

1260
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,480
on temperature

1261
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,319
and again these aren't cognitive

1262
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,920
personal affective experienced beliefs

1263
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
bayesian belief this is just saying

1264
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,640
random variable reflecting

1265
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,640
in a model variable on temperature so

1266
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,040
even a sincerely held incorrect

1267
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,200
psychological belief

1268
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
is not the bayesian belief they might

1269
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
coincide at times if it were a parameter

1270
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,440
but um

1271
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,680
the belief here being

1272
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,919
uh

1273
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,160
the prior

1274
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
it must be adaptive that's the

1275
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,400
evolutionary twist that actually helps

1276
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,160
resolve a lot of this because otherwise

1277
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,319
right the design space of all edges by

1278
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,680
all nodes

1279
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,359
and then any variable i mean it's just

1280
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,480
like saying

1281
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,160
here's all the words in the dictionary

1282
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,400
and so evolution helps restrict the

1283
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,520
discussion

1284
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,400
to

1285
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,880
cases that actually do manage to achieve

1286
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
adaptive control dean

1287
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
and this is where that translation from

1288
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,559
the silhouette of the head

1289
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,880
to a statistical density

1290
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,960
is assumed that we're the the person

1291
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,480
who's following along with this just

1292
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,720
sees that but it's but you can also see

1293
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,040
how easy it is to slip

1294
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,280
into the idea that

1295
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,640
oh wait a second we've gone from the

1296
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,440
physical space and we just held onto the

1297
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,119
physical space when really now we're

1298
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,880
talking about a statistical density

1299
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,240
space

1300
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,920
and again if you're not if you're not

1301
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,000
really really careful you can see how

1302
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,319
people can carry forward something but

1303
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
the actual thing that they're talking

1304
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,079
about has changed

1305
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,920
that's why the word discrepancy was such

1306
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
a big deal to me because i normally

1307
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,599
gloss over things but this time it

1308
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,040
actually

1309
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,559
i went oh okay so there's going to be

1310
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,240
some there's going to be some moments

1311
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,839
here where we're actually talking about

1312
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,440
different things even though in the

1313
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,119
continuum

1314
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,040
we we kind of think that they're talking

1315
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,480
about the same thing no we're not

1316
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,800
yep it's um

1317
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,480
the travails of realism and

1318
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
instrumentalism for biological active

1319
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,079
inference

1320
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
episode 55

1321
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,440
because

1322
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,800
are these terms are they an example

1323
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,079
or is this

1324
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,319
an example of a model being used to

1325
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,359
discuss

1326
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,559
a real system but

1327
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,520
this suffice to say is the architecture

1328
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
of the homeostat

1329
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,920
it undertakes action

1330
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
to reduce discrepancy

1331
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,880
relative to a prior held belief fixed in

1332
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,920
this case

1333
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,079
about what temperatures are

1334
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,079
expected slash preferred

1335
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,960
the dialectic of the first two p's from

1336
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,880
live stream number 37.

1337
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,760
this is

1338
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,680
an expectation

1339
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,520
and a preference

1340
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,920
because expectations having to do with

1341
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,119
survival

1342
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,760
are as good as preferences for survival

1343
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
over evolutionary time

1344
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,200
okay

1345
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,599
this is going to be contrasted with

1346
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,839
figure

1347
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,760
3 b

1348
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,079
which is the allostat

1349
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,839
and so we see the same

1350
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,599
stack

1351
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,839
of x 1 y 1 light blue dark blue red

1352
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,319
except there's now a second column next

1353
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,599
to it and there's some cross

1354
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,720
connectivity so again the x's are going

1355
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,680
to be beliefs about so priors on

1356
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,839
and then these are

1357
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,240
observations and so they're saying

1358
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,599
this generative model extends the

1359
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,680
homeostat by including a second set of

1360
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,319
exteroceptive variables that correspond

1361
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,160
to light intensity

1362
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,599
y2

1363
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,599
observations of light

1364
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,160
and beliefs about sunrise so like

1365
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,200
beliefs about the generative process

1366
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
so generative model of the generative

1367
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,598
process

1368
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,520
furthermore the model includes a

1369
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
predictive relationship between sunrise

1370
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
x2

1371
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,319
and body temperature y

1372
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,200
so

1373
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,280
again i wish we could label every edge

1374
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,160
because

1375
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,079
the edges are meaning different things

1376
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,400
even at different times

1377
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,280
like

1378
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,920
this is a predictive relationship

1379
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,160
so it's an anticipatory one

1380
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,800
but then the one about light intensity

1381
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,319
and the belief about sunrise there would

1382
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,240
be ways to make that an anticipatory or

1383
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,839
an anticip or an instantaneous

1384
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,800
relationship

1385
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
but the result of this sketched

1386
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,240
architecture

1387
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,440
is that inferring a sunrise

1388
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,119
which will only happen with high

1389
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,440
posterior confidence if the visual

1390
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,240
observations are consistent so low

1391
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,319
prediction error

1392
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,559
inferring a sunrise not

1393
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,040
quote seeing a sunrise

1394
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,480
that is not

1395
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,079
what is happening in the model inferring

1396
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,400
a sunrise and finding that visual

1397
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,480
observations are compatible with it

1398
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,400
can trigger the autonomic response the

1399
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,319
behavior you

1400
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,040
of thermoregulation in an anticipatory

1401
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,440
manner that is before sunlight actually

1402
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,359
increases body temperature well how

1403
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,280
would the parameter be set that way

1404
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,440
because if that were adaptive

1405
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,920
then other parameter combinations have

1406
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,559
been weeded out already by evolution

1407
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,839
so that is where we tuck the thread back

1408
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,240
into the ball of yarn which is the

1409
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,920
parameter combinations that are

1410
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,000
non-adaptive die

1411
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,680
they dissipate they fail to exist

1412
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,800
they're not going to be measured as

1413
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,440
things in the future empirically

1414
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,000
however you want to take it so like the

1415
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,240
quote like how does it work

1416
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,480
it's the same as it was 50 years ago

1417
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,359
which is it has to do with survival of

1418
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,640
the persistent stephen

1419
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,280
and these um

1420
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,040
these graphs what they're used for as

1421
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,200
well is they they do show

1422
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,000
beliefs tied to

1423
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the observation space that the space

1424
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,520
available

1425
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,240
um around the observation

1426
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,680
uh

1427
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,319
the you know whatever the sensorium

1428
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,480
that is available

1429
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,760
that's what gives the beliefs its scope

1430
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,440
and then

1431
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,240
the

1432
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,200
expectations

1433
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,480
are

1434
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,680
tied in here more clearly to action

1435
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,800
so the errors the errors of the the

1436
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,559
the the

1437
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,240
what's important the the the actual

1438
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,558
um

1439
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,880
dynamic that's driving action to change

1440
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,040
something is is is coming out of the

1441
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,119
prediction area error that's feeding

1442
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,920
into action i think that's quite

1443
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,319
important as because

1444
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,319
you know this is like the proto

1445
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,400
animal you know this is like the proto

1446
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,440
kind of

1447
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
piece here that ties into

1448
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,160
a lot of how

1449
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,960
we think about knowledge and meaning and

1450
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,720
i'm not saying that i'm just i'm just

1451
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,800
extrapolating a lot but i think it does

1452
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,240
show how

1453
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,880
beliefs are tied to

1454
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,319
the type of sensorim

1455
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,400
that is being used to shape the

1456
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,319
observation space i think that's quite

1457
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,839
useful

1458
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,520
yeah and these are just yeah dean first

1459
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,880
got

1460
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,480
i just want to get your gut both you

1461
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,520
guys opinions about that orange barbell

1462
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,079
at the bottom of the diagram because

1463
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,599
talking identity

1464
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,599
but we're also still talking about

1465
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,000
dependency we're talking about

1466
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,359
duplication

1467
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,559
we're talking about anticipation so

1468
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,720
that's a lot of stuff packed in one

1469
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,640
orange barbell what do you think

1470
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,200
yeah i'm going back to the full

1471
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,200
caption

1472
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,559
the red circles represent the expected

1473
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,280
values of x

1474
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,040
so if we're interpreting these as the

1475
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,760
posteriors on x because the expectations

1476
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,480
the priors are the top blue ones

1477
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,920
so

1478
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,040
it wouldn't have to be the red circles

1479
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,480
and they don't mention the word orange

1480
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,799
no

1481
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,599
it's there and it's identity

1482
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,839
note the lateral modulatory connections

1483
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,319
in the allostatic network c24 for

1484
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,960
details and 24 is

1485
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,040
the graphical brain with first and par

1486
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,160
and device

1487
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,000
um

1488
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
so yeah again this is just a sketch

1489
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,520
model they're not using it to fit any

1490
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,720
data

1491
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,520
or even simulate any data

1492
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,280
and it does relate to what stephen said

1493
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,480
about the

1494
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,799
the inter sensory or the intermodal

1495
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,200
inference which is one could imagine a

1496
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,319
cognitive model where if sunrise

1497
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,839
if there's noises that are associated

1498
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,280
with sunrise

1499
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,599
then beliefs about sunrise

1500
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,680
can be a variable with edges coming from

1501
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,520
different sensory modalities

1502
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,160
so it gives us a separation of

1503
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,280
the um organs of sense

1504
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,559
and internal cognitive modeling stephen

1505
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,520
yeah it gives a gives a sense of when

1506
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,480
would something be important to act upon

1507
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,240
so there's many many things that i could

1508
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,280
believe i'm seeing or being perceived in

1509
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,200
terms of this is

1510
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
sunrise or this is

1511
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,920
um

1512
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,799
you know

1513
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,720
this is the type of light coming in this

1514
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,200
is the nature of the light this is where

1515
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,720
the the light's coming from there's all

1516
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,119
sorts of stuff the stuff that's really

1517
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,599
filtering down

1518
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,640
is what is

1519
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,799
important

1520
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,079
and this is where the affordance is

1521
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,680
coming what affords me to make some

1522
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,839
action

1523
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,839
you know if it was expanding out so

1524
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,599
there can be lots of things i noticed

1525
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,000
like i might notice that

1526
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,520
that there's a line there and i may

1527
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,000
notice and believe it's orange but i may

1528
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,839
not act upon it until i take my

1529
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,000
attention to it and think it's useful as

1530
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,680
there's many things going on on the page

1531
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,680
you know so when we're

1532
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,240
we have beliefs but then there's what's

1533
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,839
being acted upon out of all of that

1534
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,319
to then create

1535
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,960
some sort of change so i think that

1536
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,160
is also quite useful in this

1537
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,799
architecture

1538
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,000
cool

1539
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,240
i want to can i add to this because i

1540
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,480
think it's really important

1541
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,640
um so we're talking about in the in the

1542
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,920
context of a

1543
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,760
of a sun coming up

1544
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,960
but

1545
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,680
let's let's see whether it still is true

1546
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,079
and i think it is just to prove a point

1547
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,119
whether that orange orange barbell

1548
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,160
still makes sense if we're talking about

1549
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,119
daniel anticipating 61 year old daniel

1550
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,280
and stephen anticipating 61 year old

1551
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,480
stephen and dean anticipating 61 year

1552
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,599
old dean

1553
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,839
now i'm much closer to 61 than the two

1554
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,480
of you but do i need the mark do i need

1555
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,440
the monte carlo do i need the play out

1556
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,000
to be able to make that anticipation as

1557
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,240
long as i have the identity and the

1558
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,720
parallelism and the backwards and

1559
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,960
forwards looking dependency that we see

1560
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,640
between x1 and x2 and y1 and y2

1561
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,160
that's what i think is makes this a very

1562
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
interesting

1563
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,559
way of being able to sort of build on

1564
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,040
the previous homeostatic

1565
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,200
example

1566
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
thanks steven

1567
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,520
yeah i think also this

1568
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,720
speaks to traditionally

1569
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,240
we think about the meaning what does

1570
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,599
this mean what's all the meaning out

1571
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,000
there as you mentioned all the data the

1572
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,480
stuff that it could mean to relate all

1573
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,280
these variables but ultimately

1574
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,880
um

1575
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,520
and the bit that is actually what

1576
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,119
active inference gives us is that

1577
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,119
barbell is where the meaning comes in

1578
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,000
it's like the way to know

1579
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,880
how

1580
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,559
being 61 is for you dean is for you

1581
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,400
to imagine

1582
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,319
what it would be like

1583
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,480
to make choices and to act in the world

1584
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,760
as a 61 year old dean not necessarily to

1585
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,040
go out and look at all the

1586
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,760
the data so to speak all the beliefs and

1587
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,040
the things we think about the world but

1588
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,960
to actually bring that in and

1589
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,319
and of course you've got a better chance

1590
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,799
to do that because you're closer to

1591
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,000
being

1592
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,760
that kind of dean

1593
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,440
um so i think that's quite interesting

1594
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,680
that barbell at the bottom in terms of

1595
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,799
um

1596
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,720
pairing together

1597
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,280
the kind of beliefs about what actions

1598
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,760
and prediction areas are available

1599
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,079
and it's more into that meaningful

1600
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,400
action meaningfulness

1601
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,480
realm rather than what does it mean

1602
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,880
what's the data tell us so

1603
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,680
yeah

1604
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,440
we might we might get there and i'm not

1605
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,640
pushing back on what you're saying

1606
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,440
stephen we might get there but i think

1607
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,280
for now

1608
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,040
what we're saying what we're saying is

1609
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,920
is that in order to get there we have to

1610
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,520
have more than

1611
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,319
more than a

1612
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,319
a single

1613
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,440
stack

1614
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,359
of dependencies

1615
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,119
we have to have

1616
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,559
a double stack

1617
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,960
in order to be able to

1618
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,160
extend the homeostatic

1619
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,280
nature

1620
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,880
of how we've evolved to where we are

1621
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,640
i don't know again i'm not pushing back

1622
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,319
on you i'm just saying i don't want to

1623
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,000
jump that i don't want to jump that

1624
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,720
firing pistol just yet because i think

1625
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,559
that orange barbell is going to turn

1626
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,559
into a green arrow and then all hail is

1627
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,480
going to break loose anyway so

1628
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,720
we should carry on i don't want to take

1629
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,400
steven's stuff away

1630
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,480
but i want i think i want to park it

1631
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,680
because we're going to go somewhere in a

1632
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,839
minute

1633
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,359
i'm hesitant to ascribe too much specif

1634
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,680
specificity to something that wasn't

1635
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,280
labeled in the caption doesn't have a

1636
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,079
clear labeling in the figure either but

1637
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,520
i think it

1638
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,839
is already demonstrated that

1639
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,760
using graphical frameworks and

1640
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,440
partitionings like we have an active

1641
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,160
inference we can start to approach some

1642
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,799
of these questions like how would

1643
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,839
different kinds of variables be

1644
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:58,720
connected how does that relate to future

1645
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,599
inference on action counterfactuals etc

1646
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,280
okay so

1647
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,720
these sections

1648
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,280
um four five six seven

1649
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
were just laying out the relationship

1650
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,799
between

1651
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,720
an evolutionary or physiological

1652
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,839
function

1653
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,160
like homeostasis allostasis or simple

1654
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,280
behavioral control models of things that

1655
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,440
are core evolutionary features and

1656
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,359
functions

1657
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,799
connecting them

1658
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,160
to the kinds of graphical

1659
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,599
representations

1660
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,440
which are like a little bit of a hybrid

1661
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,520
of a bayesian graph

1662
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,200
and

1663
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,799
a factor graph

1664
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,000
because there's some kind of

1665
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,200
computations being implied here

1666
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,280
whereas in a bayesian graph the edges

1667
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,680
only reflect statistical dependencies

1668
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,440
whereas we're bringing in a little bit

1669
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,920
more of like a nuanced type relationship

1670
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,240
that one could imagine

1671
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,119
could be unpacked a bit more

1672
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,680
were to be specified but it's just to

1673
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,280
show

1674
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,079
how

1675
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,599
different

1676
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,240
graphical models

1677
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,520
relate to

1678
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
different functions

1679
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,119
architectural

1680
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,799
underpinnings

1681
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,319
whether you think this is the actual

1682
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,599
architecture

1683
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:12,400
or

1684
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,000
whether it's just an instrumental

1685
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,640
architecture like a model structure on a

1686
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,280
given phenomena

1687
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,000
how do model architectures relate to

1688
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,960
evolutionary functions

1689
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,079
where is

1690
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,880
evolutionary time in this model we

1691
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,960
started out by asking like how do

1692
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,680
cognitive phenotypes arise

1693
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,760
specifically over evolutionary but also

1694
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,680
over developmental time

1695
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,960
and that's where we get to one of the

1696
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,319
main

1697
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,640
pieces and contributions of the paper

1698
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,559
which is

1699
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,720
figure four

1700
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,799
the five main dimensions of elaboration

1701
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,880
of generative models introduced in this

1702
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,920
paper

1703
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,280
so

1704
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,000
there's other kinds of

1705
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,520
changes and ways that this structure

1706
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,880
could evolve but they're going to focus

1707
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,839
on these five

1708
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,760
there's starting with the homeostat

1709
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,440
does that have to be our starting point

1710
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,799
maybe not

1711
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,799
but starting with the homeostat

1712
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,400
there's the i

1713
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,319
operation which is identity unchanged

1714
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,799
there's i plus i which is just a

1715
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,839
parallel isolated duplication

1716
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,160
that's like from one photoreceptor to

1717
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,039
going to two photoreceptors so to speak

1718
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,960
there's the allostat

1719
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
which is a duplication as well as a

1720
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,640
cross linking

1721
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,079
so these are just

1722
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,000
sketches one could also probably write

1723
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,440
that one as like

1724
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,440
a duplication followed by a linking and

1725
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,280
there's no like change in linking for

1726
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,000
example here so this is like

1727
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,520
a few of a taxonomy of operations

1728
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,400
there's

1729
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,799
increases in temporal depth within a

1730
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,839
level of the hierarchy so looking

1731
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,359
one more unit further in time

1732
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,599
at a given time scale

1733
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,760
and then there's hierarchical nesting

1734
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,359
with an h

1735
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,720
and the figure is shown like this

1736
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,720
because these are like the things that

1737
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,359
can happen to the homeostat

1738
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,400
and then

1739
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,400
they can have a second round and so on

1740
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
and so on

1741
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,680
there's so many other ones that could

1742
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,280
happen like where is

1743
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,160
reduction where's loss

1744
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,400
where's deduplication where's the

1745
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,640
uncoupling of the allostat reduction of

1746
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,839
temporal depth reduction of hierarchy so

1747
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,520
there's a broad space

1748
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,280
but one of the main contributions of

1749
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,480
this paper

1750
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,960
is to connect

1751
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,920
functionally oriented graphical models

1752
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,839
of homeostatic and physiological

1753
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,440
function to

1754
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,200
the operations

1755
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,280
that result in the elaboration of

1756
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,359
simpler model architectures

1757
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,240
into

1758
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,640
different architectures steen

1759
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,799
this is an interesting part i know

1760
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,799
steven wants to have to say something

1761
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,359
too but really quickly there's no plus

1762
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,760
minus multiply and divide

1763
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,480
there's an operation but there there's

1764
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,680
no

1765
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,119
symbolism for that and again

1766
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,280
that's that keeps it safe on a

1767
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,359
statistical level

1768
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,359
i think that's that's a that's a nice

1769
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,160
tell there i want to again for somebody

1770
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,079
who's just sort of looking at this for

1771
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,559
the first time pointing that out it's

1772
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,520
not there and because it's not present

1773
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,839
that tells us something to your point

1774
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,920
about maybe how do we get

1775
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,039
d duplication

1776
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,039
yes it's um

1777
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,599
well i plus i it is like

1778
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,599
it's it's a

1779
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,720
suggestive use of the addition operator

1780
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
but we're not adding these just like

1781
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,960
integers so yes

1782
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,520
they're kind of like categorical

1783
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,599
operations

1784
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,599
that constitute this evolutionary

1785
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,039
algebra

1786
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,000
okay stephen anything on figure four

1787
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,240
yeah i was just saying that

1788
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,480
i was saying they've set up they've set

1789
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,359
a

1790
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,400
a kind of a paradigm from the homeostat

1791
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,720
and they've taken that through and

1792
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,240
they've shown that plausibly can

1793
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,400
carry through to cognition

1794
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,920
and then like you say there can be other

1795
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,599
ways but what they've now given is

1796
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:16,880
they've given

1797
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,359
some legs another way to think of the

1798
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,359
legs that can be attached to that

1799
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,280
paradigm because this modeling approach

1800
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,400
while they could have chosen a lot

1801
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,480
others by taking it

1802
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,160
there are certain things that your heart

1803
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,640
baked into that early stage

1804
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,960
choice making which then

1805
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,200
makes other paradigms wouldn't fit with

1806
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,839
it right you know you certain certain

1807
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,480
even when you go instrumental or realist

1808
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,160
you know your instrumental models your

1809
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,839
realist models don't make sense unless

1810
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,720
you

1811
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,960
with this unless you take in some of the

1812
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,200
paradigms that this structuring

1813
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,680
creates

1814
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,119
yeah

1815
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,760
agreed thanks so just maybe think like

1816
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,960
is this

1817
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,760
functional model realism

1818
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,920
like the function of the model

1819
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
is what is being tracked

1820
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,520
through time

1821
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
and so that

1822
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,440
there's many other

1823
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,480
alterations that could occur and then

1824
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,000
there's

1825
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,559
the even more granular like parametric

1826
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,559
changes or changes in connectivity or

1827
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,079
edge types

1828
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,520
and then i think

1829
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,839
uh

1830
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,599
as you said dean when all hell breaks

1831
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,440
loose

1832
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
what's interesting here let's look at

1833
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,280
the allostat

1834
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,359
in a little bit closer detail

1835
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,520
okay so previously we looked at the

1836
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,280
allostat and we were like

1837
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,000
okay there's an orange bar

1838
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,319
now

1839
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,920
the allostat

1840
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,839
has a green bar

1841
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:50,960
it's a green arrow and it's a

1842
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,520
unidirectional one well this one

1843
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,520
independence

1844
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,680
the allostat

1845
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,280
has the green bar oh it's okay well

1846
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,280
those are my bad eyes because i saw i

1847
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,000
saw the little arrow from the blue

1848
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,920
actually turning i didn't actually see

1849
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,359
that there was two circles thank you

1850
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,399
there's my 60 year old eyes for you yeah

1851
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,080
um

1852
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,040
okay

1853
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,479
cool um

1854
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,439
and so

1855
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,000
each of these are in quite a different

1856
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,960
domain

1857
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,520
um or at least like a different

1858
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,679
aspect of cognition

1859
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,920
and these are the transitions that it

1860
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,439
can engage in

1861
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,399
so like

1862
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,960
duplication retains the exact same

1863
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,359
function but it's a very important step

1864
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,198
and that's a little bit what i explored

1865
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,719
in the dot zero with genetic

1866
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,880
duplications like on the left side here

1867
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,040
at the screen

1868
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,399
having a

1869
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,679
region of the genome duplicate

1870
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,238
yes one of the duplicate copies can just

1871
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,759
degenerate

1872
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,719
that may be like opening up space or

1873
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,279
creating motifs for other kinds of later

1874
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,040
evolutionary steps so even this is not

1875
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,679
like a failure it's just a change

1876
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,679
there's neo-functionalization

1877
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,520
where then those two models can start to

1878
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,439
sub-specify like if you only have one

1879
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,520
photoreceptor it has to be doing what

1880
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,319
it's doing but duplicating it

1881
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,359
then allows one to focus on a different

1882
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,080
wavelength than the other for example

1883
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,679
and then there's um sub

1884
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,520
functionalization which is where

1885
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,279
initially a composite function a b

1886
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,120
becomes

1887
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,238
two like enzymes start to sub-specialize

1888
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,560
on one of the two functions of the

1889
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,158
ancestral so this is kind of like a role

1890
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:41,439
duplication

1891
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,399
um okay so duplication is an important

1892
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,000
event

1893
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,640
then there's the allostat and

1894
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,799
multiple things happen with a

1895
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,960
but we're seeing it as there is a

1896
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,560
duplication occurring and there's also

1897
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,400
cross-linking occurring

1898
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,280
between beliefs in one modality or

1899
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,280
beliefs about one type of thing

1900
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,840
influencing observations

1901
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,000
um or in about another kind of thing

1902
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,120
as well as this lateral modulatory

1903
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,840
uh green

1904
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,080
orange bar

1905
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,679
um

1906
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,920
we have and then we have two kinds of

1907
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,640
expansions into temporal depth

1908
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,440
a sort of local expansion

1909
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,440
with the t operation

1910
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,320
just pushing the model one step deeper

1911
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,560
and then the h hierarchical nesting

1912
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,080
operation

1913
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,480
which brings it to another time scale of

1914
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,000
analysis dean

1915
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,080
and this is where i really struggled and

1916
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,120
that is in when they were at allostat

1917
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,040
it wasn't just comparative i felt like

1918
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,280
you had to build in time

1919
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,880
especially if you were talking about

1920
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,560
identity

1921
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,400
but then it was like no we're just going

1922
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,239
to leave it comparative and then we're

1923
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,719
going to introduce the oneness of this i

1924
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,719
mean i understand why they're doing that

1925
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,199
to try to make it tractable

1926
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,199
but i don't know how they can

1927
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,840
say it can be comparative

1928
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,800
meaning

1929
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,640
i know the difference between a and b

1930
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,480
right now

1931
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,120
but not not sort of address the fact

1932
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:15,920
that

1933
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,320
in order to differentiate into a and b

1934
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
some some amount of time

1935
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,360
had to

1936
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,960
had to have been applied to that split

1937
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,440
so i had i was i was saying you have to

1938
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,159
go back in time in order to just be able

1939
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,760
to do a comparison

1940
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
so it's temporal only going forward in

1941
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,080
time i don't mean all hell broke loose

1942
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,280
but i mean i i did ask this question

1943
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,000
you're right like here there's um

1944
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,520
there's the triggering in an

1945
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,360
anticipatory manner

1946
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,000
and so in one view it's like but this is

1947
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,920
a single time step model

1948
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,080
so how could that occur

1949
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,960
because it doesn't have a temporal depth

1950
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,480
on the other hand

1951
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
again like kind of that those two senses

1952
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,640
of representation in the structural

1953
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,800
sense if the model's a single time step

1954
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,040
model it can't have a representation

1955
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,040
through deep time ergo it cannot be

1956
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
anticipatory functionally

1957
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,040
right the other side of the coin

1958
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,320
would be

1959
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,679
if it's enough at this time step

1960
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,320
such that beliefs about sunrise trigger

1961
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,159
and a response

1962
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,840
the model can be functionally

1963
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,440
anticipatory

1964
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,239
without a temporal depth representation

1965
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,159
right which is why the representation

1966
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,920
discussion was very important leading up

1967
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,120
to this one

1968
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,159
because

1969
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,960
we're all over those eight quadrants

1970
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,040
here because

1971
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,640
in evolution and this is something that

1972
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,960
like cognitive psych people talk about

1973
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,920
and is like

1974
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,600
are cognition being shaped towards

1975
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,320
effective which is to say productive

1976
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,080
slash reproductive

1977
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,840
success

1978
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,520
not towards like ultimate truth

1979
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,880
discovery

1980
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,159
and so

1981
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,000
should we be too surprised that our

1982
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,080
instrumentation

1983
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,159
which has had a certain objective

1984
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,080
function

1985
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,760
is then susceptible to

1986
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,080
being convinced about things that

1987
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,120
are not

1988
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,800
true

1989
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,640
well i don't i don't socialize with

1990
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,600
those people so i i don't know i just

1991
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,920
knew that when i was looking at it i was

1992
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,480
thinking in real practical terms

1993
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,159
what what what is built into this in

1994
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,840
order for it to still make sense and

1995
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,239
that wasn't necessarily parsed out

1996
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,159
in the diagram you kind of had to fill

1997
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,920
that in

1998
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,440
through your own interpretation of what

1999
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,520
was going on so thus back to discrepancy

2000
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,040
that discrepancy thing is going to come

2001
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,480
up again and again and i'm really glad

2002
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,760
that they inserted it at the beginning

2003
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,159
steven

2004
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,080
i think it's useful here to hear this

2005
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,400
temple depth and hierarchical

2006
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,600
depth

2007
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,960
being sort of

2008
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,360
spelt out so

2009
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,480
because

2010
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,679
i think it sometimes it's a little

2011
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,080
confusing in other papers quite where it

2012
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,960
fits

2013
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,800
so temporal depth and this again might

2014
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,480
be where some of this ontology work can

2015
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,880
be useful just to see if that can be

2016
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,280
kind of consistent but if temporal depth

2017
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,040
is you know you've got

2018
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,600
variables for past present and future

2019
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,560
states

2020
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,120
but they're operating

2021
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,120
maybe

2022
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,640
maybe within the same kind of dynamics

2023
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,840
and then if you've got

2024
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,440
different um

2025
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,880
temple

2026
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,719
rates

2027
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,679
operating simultaneously

2028
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,320
then you get that hierarchical depth

2029
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,239
and i thought in the past i'd sometimes

2030
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,239
thought temporal depth would have

2031
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,960
covered that more hierarchical

2032
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,320
depth

2033
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,440
so

2034
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,360
you know this is interesting to think

2035
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,280
about whether this might be

2036
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,800
actually the way that that

2037
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,080
differentiation is best made

2038
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,920
differentiation is probably best made

2039
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,400
with reference to a specific model and

2040
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,360
this gives us the design language

2041
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,679
and the grammar and the motifs

2042
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,159
so if we want to predict 100 years in

2043
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,760
the future

2044
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,760
should we have

2045
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,360
a decade

2046
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,320
model

2047
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,040
with 10 year models

2048
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,800
that's a times depth of 10 decades

2049
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,040
and then a nested model with a depth of

2050
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,880
10 years

2051
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,840
or

2052
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,719
but we have a one layer model

2053
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,280
with a hundred

2054
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,960
they're very different

2055
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,080
and it's not to say that one is like

2056
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,480
more accurate or less and depending on

2057
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,640
how the exact situation is set up maybe

2058
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,960
the computational requirements of one or

2059
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,719
higher are different than the other

2060
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:45,440
but

2061
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,760
that's the discussion to have do we want

2062
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,120
to have a b

2063
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,280
transition matrix

2064
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,360
let's look at a nested model with

2065
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,040
temporal depth

2066
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,519
so here

2067
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,040
we have on the top level of the model

2068
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,600
s state 2

2069
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,719
this is

2070
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,400
temporal depth

2071
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,080
happening at the upper level of the

2072
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,960
model three discrete time points in an

2073
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,600
upper level

2074
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,719
that is temporal depth

2075
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,960
there's also nesting

2076
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,880
within each

2077
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,840
um

2078
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,360
time step

2079
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,000
there's a cognitive rollout on three

2080
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,159
time steps this is one type of nested

2081
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,920
model but there's other nestings that

2082
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,120
can exist

2083
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,640
so here we see

2084
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,360
a depth of two

2085
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,440
and then at each

2086
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,560
level

2087
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,040
of the nesting there's three

2088
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,840
temporal depth

2089
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,239
but they're totally different in

2090
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,480
architecture and in function so it is

2091
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,480
the interesting discussion like

2092
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,400
especially when we have to do

2093
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,640
multi-scale prediction like fermi

2094
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,840
estimation

2095
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,000
so if the prediction is within one time

2096
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,520
scale

2097
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,800
there isn't necessarily a need to nest

2098
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,840
but

2099
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,000
once we get into larger time scales or

2100
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,080
where there's recurrence over multiple

2101
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,440
time scales

2102
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,960
it makes sense to have a nesting model

2103
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,480
like if we wanted to predict someone's

2104
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,520
activity over the next seven days

2105
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,320
it might make sense to have a day

2106
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,600
model with a nested model inside of that

2107
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,480
because then within each day there could

2108
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,159
be parameter setting

2109
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,159
versus just trying to fit one time

2110
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,960
series and find the parameters

2111
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,760
that make that one time series oscillate

2112
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,440
in a circadian way

2113
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,480
instead we just need a day model with a

2114
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,400
very specific kind of simple transition

2115
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,679
and then a transition at a nested level

2116
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,440
with a depth that's measured at the

2117
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,360
hourly or the minute time scale rather

2118
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,560
than the days

2119
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,080
and that becomes especially important

2120
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,360
when doing

2121
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,280
family based model fitting like

2122
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,960
variational inference

2123
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,400
so we're not just like getting all the

2124
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,000
data points and fitting a spline through

2125
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,719
them

2126
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,159
but we actually

2127
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,199
need to have appropriate model structure

2128
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,600
otherwise free energy minimization

2129
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,679
will drive right off the cliff

2130
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,080
just like we talked about with axel's

2131
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,440
bacterium

2132
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,679
so if we want to do free energy

2133
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,880
minimization and model selection

2134
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,080
on

2135
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,080
model structures

2136
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,080
we can find the best model relatively

2137
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,000
easily given the families that we've

2138
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,719
specified but there's no guarantees once

2139
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,360
we step outside of that spotlight

2140
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,600
that we're even in the right category

2141
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,320
structurally and so that's why

2142
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,360
humans

2143
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,840
having these design motifs in mind and

2144
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,920
many many many more

2145
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,280
helps us not get into what seems to be a

2146
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,600
global optimization

2147
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,280
based upon free energy minimization but

2148
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,440
actually is a very relatively local

2149
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,400
optimization based upon unimaginative

2150
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,239
model structured learning stephen

2151
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,560
yeah thanks that's really helpful and

2152
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,719
and it also ties into something i've

2153
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,960
been really thinking about in terms of

2154
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,960
the modeling itself is

2155
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,120
these these these scales these steps you

2156
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,640
know you're talking about the multi-year

2157
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,000
decades

2158
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,480
when we're modeling it's like what do we

2159
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,080
have access to

2160
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,640
so we tend to ascribe that in terms of

2161
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,679
what can we externalize what can we use

2162
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:22,880
to

2163
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,719
put something into a model if it's

2164
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,080
instrumental and then of course there's

2165
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,640
a question of well what is the realist

2166
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,880
perspective on that and what is there

2167
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,159
that's within

2168
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,480
our conscious awareness of being in the

2169
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,800
world something that can be reported as

2170
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,719
an event a story

2171
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,600
and

2172
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,480
what time scales are present there when

2173
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,640
you get into 100 years it's beyond that

2174
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,080
so then you're saying okay what are you

2175
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,239
going to extrapolate what sort of

2176
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,600
temple structure but on the other scale

2177
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,080
if i'm asking what do i think

2178
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,199
i expect you to do next or to dean to do

2179
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,320
next

2180
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,719
and that might seem intuitive i can have

2181
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,840
a whole series of

2182
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,400
temple and nested scales going on which

2183
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,600
is not even available to me

2184
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,239
in a in a cognitive conscious way

2185
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,639
i might have a sense i have a feel for

2186
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,600
what i think is going on but a lot of my

2187
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,840
um predictive processing

2188
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,560
will be happening at rates

2189
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,120
unavailable to my conscious awareness

2190
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,440
so that's that also ties in i suppose

2191
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,199
i'm not saying it's an art sort of adds

2192
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,120
to the challenge i suppose but it is the

2193
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,560
challenge of

2194
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
you know how much ends up being what we

2195
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
can get a measure on to put into our

2196
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,080
model

2197
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,239
as much as what it is and that's the

2198
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,159
same challenge in a way that comes even

2199
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,600
from the realist perspective at some

2200
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,520
level as an organism what is it that i

2201
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,320
even can access

2202
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,080
in some realistic way not saying we can

2203
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,600
model it or no

2204
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,280
that could be put into something like

2205
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,520
this sorry you're going to say something

2206
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,520
well all i was going to add is that i

2207
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,600
mean so the paper's talking about how do

2208
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,400
we how do we use

2209
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,840
certain math

2210
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,520
to be able to understand maybe the

2211
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,159
evolution of of cognition

2212
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,320
right that's essentially what the paper

2213
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,400
is trying to give you know point us in

2214
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,320
that direction so

2215
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,320
again in order to make this accessible

2216
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,080
in order to sort of lower the barrier

2217
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,400
for people who actually want to have

2218
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,600
this make sense because they don't

2219
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,760
necessarily spend

2220
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,760
sums and sums of hours on on trying to

2221
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,199
figure this stuff out like the authors

2222
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,600
or maybe even us

2223
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,719
i'm going to i want to point out

2224
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,560
something that i think is obvious to us

2225
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,480
but maybe not so obvious to people who

2226
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,159
are looking at this and going

2227
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,639
i have no idea what they're saying

2228
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,080
i think first of all is that there's a

2229
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,560
chrono a chronolog chronology which we

2230
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,719
keep going back to not just at the

2231
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,560
temporal depth level

2232
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,960
but so that's relativity math there's an

2233
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,280
evolutionary aspect to this so that's

2234
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,920
algebraic math and there's a dependency

2235
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,840
so there's a statistical math

2236
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,480
do we have to be poly math in order to

2237
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,280
be able to feel our way through this

2238
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,800
and i'm going to go back to what i said

2239
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,719
at the end of the 37

2240
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,560
first carl firsten said you're not gonna

2241
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,120
be a polymath but you better be

2242
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,280
at least somewhat comfortable feeling

2243
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,480
comfortable

2244
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,400
with the math because there's no one

2245
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,600
math

2246
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,120
that's going to get you here it's a

2247
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,880
blending of all of them

2248
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,880
and then it's how it how you feel about

2249
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,920
that

2250
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,360
that's probably going to be the thing

2251
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,080
that lowers

2252
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,360
the the impediment to really being able

2253
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,320
to use this now in real practical terms

2254
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,080
going forward so what's the next

2255
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,719
evolutionary step right it's how you're

2256
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,280
able to turn this into something

2257
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,960
so i think that's

2258
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,040
i think that's one of the great gifts of

2259
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,280
this paper if

2260
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,120
you're not afraid of being

2261
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,560
if you don't consider if you don't want

2262
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,239
to identify now where you don't

2263
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,679
duplicate now

2264
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,440
or you don't allostat now as a polymath

2265
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,080
maybe maybe that's something

2266
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:02,880
we

2267
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,560
we owe people

2268
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,840
that want to get into this

2269
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,760
maybe the british

2270
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,480
pronunciation of maths

2271
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,760
helps

2272
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,440
reflect that there's already a plurality

2273
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,960
of maths

2274
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,199
and kirby erner coming more from the

2275
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,520
synergetic side talks a lot about this

2276
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,040
actually like how

2277
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,120
the discourse around math as universal

2278
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,400
language

2279
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,360
makes it sound like math is a singular

2280
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,719
language

2281
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,080
when actually math is a pluriverse and

2282
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,639
so maths reflects that a little better

2283
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,080
better

2284
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,520
it's not like

2285
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,719
these are um

2286
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,239
just sort of

2287
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,960
slopes on one mountain and that's mount

2288
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,120
math and it's so high and only a few

2289
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,520
people get to the top and scale every

2290
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,480
side

2291
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,159
this is just like

2292
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,800
we're using maths

2293
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
yes of all different kinds steven

2294
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,159
and often that you see a lot of this in

2295
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,440
the papers that are published around

2296
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,120
active inference there's often a team of

2297
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,120
people a group of people where maybe one

2298
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,639
member has that

2299
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,000
higher level

2300
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,080
understanding the math but the other

2301
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,120
question is is to understand

2302
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,840
what would it mean to make an

2303
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,960
observation now that could be a very the

2304
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,120
mathematician may not be the one what

2305
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,800
like some of the work with ryan smith's

2306
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,320
work on the gut

2307
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,400
you know it was like well

2308
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,000
they're going to do gut inference well

2309
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,600
how do you get

2310
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,600
some tractable

2311
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,120
source

2312
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,679
on what's the gut doing so they created

2313
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,199
some electrode i'm not quite sure how

2314
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,480
they did it but they had some way of

2315
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,840
getting

2316
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,560
sensory information effectively sensory

2317
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,560
information or effectively some sort of

2318
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,560
information to put into their model

2319
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,440
and

2320
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,920
so knowing how

2321
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,040
action

2322
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,280
and observations

2323
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,719
can flow in and the implications of that

2324
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,080
i think is also kind of a

2325
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,520
a big part of

2326
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,239
of this right and

2327
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,639
in some cases it may be

2328
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,159
the trivial part because it's fairly

2329
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,120
obvious in other parts that may be the

2330
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,320
biggest

2331
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,360
barrier

2332
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,719
to and then that may be the biggest

2333
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,040
barrier as well often in in organisms

2334
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,000
right how do you how do you even access

2335
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,280
plausibly

2336
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,280
the approximation science which isn't so

2337
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,920
approximate approximate it's just chaos

2338
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,639
that is tractable

2339
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,639
yeah the rate limiting step

2340
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:29,920
or

2341
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,159
impact and improvement

2342
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,000
in the real world

2343
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,080
is unlikely to be any single

2344
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,679
individual's

2345
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,560
conceptualization of math

2346
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,400
on a team

2347
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,560
if it's structured appropriately

2348
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,520
and

2349
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,520
for those pushing the frontiers of math

2350
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,600
their understanding of math is quite

2351
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,960
literally

2352
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,520
a rate limiting step for them

2353
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,800
or maybe it might be something very

2354
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,239
mundane like

2355
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,480
time availability but when it comes to

2356
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,920
thinking about

2357
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,080
real model based science and

2358
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,000
translational applications of active

2359
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,400
inference

2360
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,440
i think that we're working towards new

2361
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,560
ways of

2362
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,920
combining skills

2363
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,080
and having shared knowledge resources

2364
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,320
that help make that make sense

2365
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,000
and using

2366
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,159
shared language and

2367
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,159
ontologies narratives formal documents

2368
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,000
tools on ft

2369
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,520
because we're doing it on teams and

2370
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,360
we're online

2371
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,440
let's just in the last

2372
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,360
20 30 minutes

2373
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,760
go through the final pieces of the paper

2374
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,920
so that this dot one will have been like

2375
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,159
a first sweep

2376
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,800
initial pheromone deposition and then we

2377
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,400
can return and take some cul-de-sacs etc

2378
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,760
so

2379
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,920
section nine

2380
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,600
explores a little bit how the

2381
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,960
duplication

2382
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,520
operation

2383
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,679
allows for multiple behaviors to arise

2384
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,600
and that's sort of by analogy to the um

2385
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,520
the genomic duplications and

2386
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,280
specializations and all those different

2387
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,159
routes that can occur

2388
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,480
here they connected duplication

2389
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,840
a little bit more directly

2390
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,520
to the factor graph models

2391
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,800
in the sense that duplicated

2392
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,120
motifs have dynamics that are conserved

2393
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,679
over different sensory motor domains

2394
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,600
so let's just say that we just had a

2395
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,560
visual model with the column of visual

2396
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,400
and then we duplicated it so now we have

2397
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,520
two photoreceptors with parallel columns

2398
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,480
and now

2399
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,120
the photoreceptor in the second one

2400
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,760
changes into a chemoreceptor because

2401
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,560
instead of expressing rhodopsin protein

2402
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,960
it's expressing an olfactory receptor

2403
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,360
protein

2404
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,280
there can be a conservation of the

2405
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,639
dynamics

2406
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,400
of inference

2407
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,840
even when the observation has changed

2408
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,320
but it was a slot for observation

2409
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,600
and so we went from having like

2410
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,120
monocular vision

2411
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,360
to binocular vision

2412
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,480
to

2413
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,639
monocular vision and

2414
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,040
olfactory perception but you can't get

2415
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,600
there in one jump to just like duplicate

2416
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,679
and transpose

2417
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,120
it's not likely to happen in an

2418
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,719
evolutionary context

2419
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:25,520
and

2420
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,560
we can see the structure

2421
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,000
of these graphical models

2422
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,080
as equivalent to being factorized

2423
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,480
probability distributions

2424
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,760
which is to say that the sparse

2425
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,719
connectivity of variables

2426
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,639
means that we can make parts of the

2427
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:43,600
model

2428
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,360
that can be like fine-tuned

2429
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,199
independently in a way that can be fit

2430
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,639
very attractively

2431
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,400
that's the factor graph that's

2432
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,400
factorized bayesian inference and we've

2433
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,239
talked about that in other places but

2434
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,719
just to here all we need to say is

2435
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,000
duplication

2436
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,520
enables

2437
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,040
like a control c

2438
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,520
control v copy paste and then let's edit

2439
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,199
the other version

2440
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,600
but that can now happen with

2441
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,320
evolutionary features and functions dean

2442
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,480
real quick your hand gestures in this

2443
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,480
section point to the orthogonal

2444
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,239
orthogonal mesh beginning

2445
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,320
okay and then point two i'd like to pull

2446
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,239
that apart a little bit but let's carry

2447
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,400
on but that's that's what i've took away

2448
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,679
from this the men the mesh began

2449
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,800
and in the beginning there was a mesh

2450
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,840
begins

2451
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,400
we'll return to that for um

2452
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,679
dot two

2453
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,440
yeah okay

2454
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,600
section 10

2455
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,520
talks about

2456
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,199
temporal depth it's about time

2457
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,040
and about the endowing of generative

2458
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,199
models with temporal depth and the way

2459
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,280
that that supports prospective inference

2460
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,120
anticipation

2461
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,840
or retrospective inference

2462
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,960
which is like memory

2463
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,560
so here's what the operator looks like

2464
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,560
we have x sub tau

2465
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,040
x at a time point and then now there's x

2466
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,159
tau plus one the next time point

2467
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,000
or t plus one

2468
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,960
could be now and then t

2469
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,320
could be

2470
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,840
the last moment

2471
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,120
so

2472
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,080
um

2473
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,880
memory

2474
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,520
i still see figure four

2475
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,760
um

2476
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,040
slide 29

2477
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,840
okay

2478
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:37,280
yeah so the structure of anticipation

2479
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,760
and of memory are very similar it just

2480
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,560
depends whether one has the um

2481
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,040
stream of observations happening

2482
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,400
on the left side

2483
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,480
and a prospection or the stream of

2484
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,920
observations are on the right side and

2485
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,280
in which case it's retrospection stephen

2486
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,800
yeah i mean sort of ties in they talk

2487
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,639
about what the police do it's very hard

2488
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,800
for someone to lie backwards so you

2489
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,239
always get them to tell their story

2490
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,199
backwards because it's a it's very hard

2491
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:05,280
for them to to do that because

2492
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,800
you say if we're

2493
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,719
creating things

2494
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,960
retrospectively but

2495
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,199
playing them forward so to speak it

2496
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:17,080
would kind of time without

2497
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,159
i want to emancipate that

2498
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,199
i looked up police in the paper i see

2499
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,759
policies

2500
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,520
is that policies

2501
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,760
um

2502
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,400
it's a great opportunity for my favorite

2503
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,120
joke but i won't

2504
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,040
um

2505
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,520
this section talks about temporal depth

2506
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,840
okay

2507
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,360
from whence temporal depth

2508
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,199
various researchers have speculated that

2509
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:52,639
a major driving force for the

2510
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,800
development of deep temporal models was

2511
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,320
foraging

2512
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,560
and there's a lot of interesting

2513
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,719
empirical and conceptual reasons to

2514
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:01,760
think about

2515
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,600
foraging in terms of temporal and

2516
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,639
spatial depth of model

2517
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:09,280
and that's true in the vertebrates

2518
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,400
where they're

2519
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,480
discussing mainly like hippocampus and

2520
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,480
entorinal system

2521
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,440
and in the invertebrates that don't have

2522
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,760
a hippocampus enterorinal system but

2523
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,440
it's one reason why comparative

2524
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,520
neuroscience is so important

2525
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,199
because it prevents us from getting

2526
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:27,679
fixed on specific anatomical

2527
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,120
realizations

2528
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,120
of given functional attributes of

2529
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,360
evolutionary systems like

2530
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,239
if the story of memory is just about

2531
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:39,600
some brain region in humans

2532
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,920
it may be a useful model it's not even

2533
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,920
to say that it's inaccurate it's not

2534
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,760
even to say that it's a partial model it

2535
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,920
just is a model of that whereas if we

2536
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,520
want to understand

2537
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,600
a given cognitive function in a broader

2538
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,120
context

2539
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,120
we have to pull back somewhere a little

2540
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,560
bit

2541
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,000
beyond or

2542
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,800
in complement to the anatomy because we

2543
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
need the empirical anatomy

2544
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,560
to have anything specific to be talking

2545
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,760
about

2546
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,719
but

2547
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,320
it isn't just the case that vertebrae

2548
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,400
anatomy is the way to do active

2549
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,719
inference uh stephen

2550
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,080
yeah i think this is really helpful

2551
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,040
because

2552
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,520
it it shows that you know the traps you

2553
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,960
were just mentioning there that people

2554
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,800
we fall into is like

2555
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,360
humans have you know the the frontal

2556
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,840
cortex it's all about this new then

2557
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,520
what's the new parts of the brain that

2558
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,840
are there but we don't say that with a

2559
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,520
formula one car we say well it's just

2560
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,920
got a primitive engine thing in there

2561
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,920
and the rest of it's evolved it's like

2562
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,400
well that's itself different like this

2563
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,239
and the same with the mark someone's

2564
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,000
conversation you know

2565
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,239
the the the evolution of the break

2566
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,960
what's often dismissed as the primitive

2567
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,199
parts of the brain

2568
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,239
they they themselves can have been

2569
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,600
more sophisticated although they're

2570
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,480
doing more things but that they

2571
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,440
they they they may be helped to be doing

2572
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,400
more

2573
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,320
than they were as opposed to there's

2574
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,960
something else um

2575
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,960
that is doing all the heavy lifting

2576
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,840
which i think is certainly common

2577
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,760
a common misconception i think in

2578
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,239
psychology anyway

2579
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,040
dean

2580
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,920
can i read quickly from the paper sure

2581
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,159
okay the evolution of temporally deep

2582
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,320
models from simpler models could been

2583
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,400
realized during evolution via the

2584
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,159
progressive keyword here partialization

2585
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,239
of an initially undifferentiated model

2586
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:34,320
so a relative sense of an invariance

2587
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,320
i.e a model that does not distinguish

2588
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,159
present from past future

2589
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:39,600
into a model that features separate

2590
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,600
latent states for the past present and

2591
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,880
future

2592
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,960
this is the part i loved a key drive for

2593
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,960
this factorization

2594
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,920
or parcelation parcellation may have

2595
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,880
been the observation and progressive

2596
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,239
internalization of the sensory motor

2597
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,960
sequences sequence sequentially

2598
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,719
that the animal creates and experiences

2599
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,800
while acting

2600
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,719
while acting in other words the

2601
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,560
self-modeling of one's own sequential

2602
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,880
behavior patterns c53 for a

2603
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,199
computational example i didn't open up

2604
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,840
53 but again if we want to talk about

2605
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,080
the polymath piece of this and the fact

2606
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,239
that our hex cells

2607
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,400
have to do some partialization it's

2608
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,679
right there

2609
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,000
in terms of sort of the the

2610
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,760
the next layer

2611
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,000
on top of this as we move up through

2612
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,719
that evolutionary cycle

2613
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,280
yeah 53 is

2614
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,560
stoin of

2615
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,639
at all the hippocampal formation as a

2616
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,639
hierarchical generative model supporting

2617
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,239
generative replay and continual learning

2618
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:41,440
there's a ton

2619
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,800
that could be said about that from like

2620
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,520
a computational and a neuro anatomical

2621
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,840
perspective

2622
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,080
the internalization of the sensory motor

2623
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,280
sequences

2624
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,480
relates to the sensory motor detachment

2625
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,239
that we talked about in the

2626
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,920
representation paper

2627
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,560
so if um some motor region in the brain

2628
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,480
if it's like a marionette and the

2629
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,760
fingers and then the motor um plant

2630
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,600
so that motor region is

2631
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,840
has to be coupled to the activity of

2632
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,320
that motor region like either in a one

2633
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,920
directional way or maybe even in a

2634
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,159
bi-directional way let's just say so

2635
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,600
that system

2636
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,400
like

2637
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,719
as it thinks so it does

2638
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,480
and vice versa

2639
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,960
it cannot engage in counter factuals

2640
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,119
because any

2641
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:31,760
direction that the neural system turns

2642
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,679
the motor system is just simply doing

2643
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:34,800
that

2644
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,679
so it is not able to engage over

2645
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,560
evolutionary time in bowel adaptive

2646
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,760
action

2647
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,600
the ones that do no longer persist

2648
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,719
it's just it's always what ties it back

2649
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,360
to reality into like the finite amount

2650
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,760
of entities on the finite spaceship

2651
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,920
earth like darwin's famous calculation

2652
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,760
like if the number of elephants slowly

2653
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,159
reproducing like they'll cover the earth

2654
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,600
unless

2655
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,119
their population levels are kept in

2656
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,080
check

2657
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,199
and so

2658
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:08,800
um once there's sensory motor detachment

2659
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,360
so there's some brain region either a

2660
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,960
motor region or some supplemental area

2661
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,800
some ancillary area

2662
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,280
that's able to intervene in that process

2663
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,840
or somehow play a role that's detached

2664
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,000
from the motor activity

2665
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,719
now there can be like a motor planning

2666
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,000
occurring

2667
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,400
that opens up the affordance of temporal

2668
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,040
depth or of counter factuals all these

2669
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,119
other cognitive functions

2670
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,119
arising

2671
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,760
via the sensory motor detachment

2672
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,199
and so

2673
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,280
um

2674
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,000
foraging is an awesome place to look at

2675
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,360
that

2676
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,000
for a lot of reasons

2677
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,440
in different

2678
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,000
life forms and computational forging and

2679
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,360
so like just a few of the notes were

2680
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,320
like

2681
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,000
what are the real cognitive demands of

2682
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,520
foraging

2683
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,360
for different creatures and

2684
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,520
what about internal foraging like mental

2685
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,719
foraging

2686
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:07,119
and these papers are very good

2687
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,960
foraging in mind and foraging in

2688
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,960
semantic fields

2689
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,159
both very

2690
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,440
useful

2691
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,119
because they have to do with the way

2692
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,639
that um

2693
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,119
they have some nice maths too but they

2694
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,920
have to do with

2695
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,040
how

2696
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,360
actions that are spatial

2697
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,560
can have conserved dynamics structurally

2698
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,480
just like we explored here

2699
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,960
to mental actions and then we see them

2700
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,040
come together like with a memory palace

2701
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,800
or something like that

2702
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,760
um

2703
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,360
so foraging is cool it's good to study

2704
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,119
eleven endowing generative models with

2705
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,360
hierarchical depth of four's multi-scale

2706
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,119
inference we kind of addressed that

2707
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,760
earlier with like the decades and years

2708
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,159
nested temporal modeling is not the same

2709
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,839
as just deep temporal modeling

2710
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,760
and then um and another way to look at

2711
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,760
that is like how many operations you

2712
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,880
would need to get to a hundred years

2713
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,960
well if you're gonna do only temporal

2714
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,040
depth it's gonna take plus a hundred or

2715
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,719
ninety nine time steps versus if it's

2716
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,239
one nesting and then 10 on the higher

2717
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,320
order than 10 on the lower order it was

2718
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,400
21 operations

2719
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,080
and so then

2720
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,400
there's shorter

2721
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,199
sequence of events to achieve a higher

2722
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:28,880
performance model assuming that they're

2723
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,320
appropriate

2724
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,400
um

2725
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,760
section 12

2726
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,520
uh yeah go ahead

2727
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,920
just one thing just on on that modeling

2728
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,440
it's also interesting think about how we

2729
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,320
think of time because like indigenous

2730
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,719
approaches tends to be well as a

2731
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,960
cyclical time right so

2732
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,280
things in the future will be a repeat of

2733
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,560
the cycle

2734
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,239
so

2735
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:55,119
the times of uh i thought of in in the

2736
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,679
cyclic motion of the sort of passing of

2737
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,520
the day passing of the

2738
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,440
um and of course we have this

2739
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,239
we we have this assumption of time

2740
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,000
stretching out you know

2741
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,600
so is it that we will uh you know over

2742
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,520
time is it

2743
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,440
well what will things be like in four

2744
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,440
generations

2745
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,480
and

2746
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,920
um and if my world or my ecology

2747
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,000
follows certain cyclical patterns and

2748
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,760
it's very stable maybe that's quite a

2749
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,679
good way to think about

2750
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,159
um you know it's like say plant plant

2751
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:30,400
the tree now to help the people in 150

2752
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,760
years you know

2753
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,000
so um

2754
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,679
it sort of comes back to

2755
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:38,719
there's different ways to construct

2756
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,080
how we

2757
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,980
think about time

2758
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,719
[Music]

2759
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,560
cool

2760
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,840
so 12 looks into

2761
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,360
phylogenetic tree of the evolution of

2762
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,719
generative model so

2763
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,960
what is a phylogenetic tree

2764
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,560
and what's the relationship between

2765
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,600
active inference slash fep and evolution

2766
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,960
well

2767
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,560
we'll have more to share

2768
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,800
in the coming papers as always but how

2769
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,679
do they address it specifically here in

2770
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,320
figure five

2771
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:16,239
they um map on will root the tree so

2772
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,639
technically as shown right here it's an

2773
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,480
unrooted tree there is an implicit

2774
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,760
rooting here

2775
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,920
but it's a very interesting feature of

2776
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,080
phylogenetics that few outside of the

2777
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,800
field know about that computationally

2778
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,119
the tree is often inferred in an

2779
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,239
unrooted fashion like by

2780
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,600
clustering the ones that are close and

2781
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,920
finding the relationships etc

2782
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,679
however

2783
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,800
that is leaving an ambiguity

2784
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,400
as to where the root of the tree is so

2785
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,320
like for example if this is the overall

2786
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,119
connectivity of the um

2787
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,800
based upon the phylogenetic inference

2788
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,400
this is what the tree topology has been

2789
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,159
inferred to look like

2790
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,520
and somebody might say well it looks

2791
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,119
like this one the red one and then the

2792
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,719
green one below it

2793
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,239
they are um

2794
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:04,719
they're clearly very closely related

2795
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,480
but actually if the root

2796
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,280
comes in here

2797
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,159
then

2798
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,400
that's not necessarily the case

2799
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,360
so the rooting of a phylogenetic tree is

2800
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,239
very important and a tree that's rooted

2801
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,159
inappropriately or has an inappropriate

2802
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,760
out group selection

2803
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,000
is just

2804
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,840
it's worse than illegible because it's

2805
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,600
highly legible and it can have a high

2806
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,679
statistical confidence but it can have

2807
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,400
an absolutely non-biological topology

2808
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,159
but assuming that they meant the tree to

2809
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,960
be rooted here

2810
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,360
here the branches

2811
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,520
are where there's going to be different

2812
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,159
operators occurring including the i

2813
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,639
identity unchanging one

2814
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:47,920
and then

2815
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,840
the edges

2816
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,560
reflect like bifurcations expeciation

2817
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,520
events

2818
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,719
so here there's an ancestral homeostat

2819
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,560
and then the lineage leading to orange

2820
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,920
did not go

2821
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,679
undergo any changes that were

2822
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,440
non-conservative

2823
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,840
on the branch leading to these sister

2824
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,880
species

2825
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,639
there was a duplication

2826
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,400
and then it stayed the same and stayed

2827
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,400
the same and then the purple node is

2828
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,360
going to have

2829
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:16,000
two duplicated homeostats and so they're

2830
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,440
just overlying

2831
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,760
evolutionary algebra the steps that they

2832
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,040
gave

2833
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,119
on to the topology of speciation and so

2834
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:25,920
that

2835
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,520
um as they discuss

2836
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,840
opens up a way to think from this sort

2837
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,239
of graphical functional perspective

2838
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:36,639
which is compatible with active

2839
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:39,440
to think about how for example

2840
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,440
from the species today

2841
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,080
we could infer some of the schema of the

2842
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,080
early vertebrate brain or the early

2843
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,440
prime vein

2844
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,360
or push it back further what about the

2845
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,880
common ancestors of the vertebrates and

2846
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,639
the invertebrates

2847
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:54,000
and all these other questions but that's

2848
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,239
kind of what they lay out here

2849
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,880
and so these are familiar models to

2850
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,960
evolutionary biologists

2851
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,000
like

2852
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,840
uh phylogenetic

2853
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,679
ancestral state reconstructions of

2854
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:07,440
phenotype

2855
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,360
which are often even done in a bayesian

2856
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,159
way

2857
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,159
like there's an algorithm beast

2858
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,280
bayesian

2859
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,480
estimation of ancestral states

2860
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,880
this is also a bayesian

2861
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,800
model that allows us to do

2862
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,400
reconstruction of ancestral states but

2863
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,480
it's in a very very different way

2864
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,840
than it's been approached outside of the

2865
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,280
active world

2866
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,679
but that's figure 5

2867
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:30,639
and

2868
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,719
that's where we see the evolutionary

2869
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,040
algebra the design patterns or the

2870
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,800
pattern language

2871
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,520
for

2872
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,719
structural changes in generative model

2873
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,560
superimposed on

2874
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,320
species relatedness and a phylogenetic

2875
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,320
tree

2876
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,480
any thoughts on five

2877
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,560
i tried to convert this and reapply it

2878
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,560
to my

2879
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,880
picking of teams in the march madness

2880
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,040
table and i wasn't able to take

2881
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,880
philosophic

2882
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,119
trees and and convert them into winning

2883
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,199
thousands of dollars on betting on

2884
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:13,920
college basketball so despite my best

2885
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,880
efforts

2886
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,000
it's it's kind of contained and for what

2887
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,560
what it represents

2888
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,400
i mean not to foreshadow too hard but i

2889
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,119
think

2890
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,679
live stream number 39 and 40

2891
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,280
might constitute march madness

2892
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,639
and then also here's another um you know

2893
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,880
for those who watch

2894
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,280
okay here now we have a little bit of a

2895
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,040
march madness bracket going don't we

2896
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,679
here's bracketology

2897
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:43,679
that is so fantastic

2898
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,040
so here we go

2899
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:48,480
yep so now we have um now here the root

2900
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,800
could have been here

2901
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,880
and then here's like two big species

2902
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,320
clades like two like this is like

2903
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,920
vertebrates and invertebrates and then

2904
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,320
there's some rooted clade

2905
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,400
so that's like why it's important to

2906
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,480
root the tree because here it looks like

2907
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,480
all of these are sister to each other at

2908
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,880
the exclusion of this one but then if we

2909
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,600
were to have rooted that tree like

2910
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,360
here

2911
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,000
then actually this is a small sister out

2912
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,159
group to all of these

2913
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:16,960
right

2914
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,560
and so it the rooting and the

2915
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,400
contextualizing

2916
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,400
is really important it's just like it's

2917
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,719
super interesting because it seems like

2918
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,320
you put in so much data into these

2919
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,239
phylogenetic models and it seems like

2920
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:30,320
literally how could this not converge on

2921
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,119
a super obvious answer i mean

2922
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,520
isn't it clear how these ants are

2923
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,159
related to each other phylogenetically

2924
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:39,520
but then there's a little bit of nuance

2925
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,800
that enters the picture stephen

2926
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,239
yeah it's curious that the allostatic

2927
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:47,679
can

2928
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:50,719
recombine with the homeostatic

2929
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,840
to give a base level temporal

2930
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,440
it's um

2931
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,679
like that doesn't it doesn't deflate

2932
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,119
back to

2933
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:01,760
just staying

2934
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,440
anaesthetic i suppose there would be

2935
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,199
they just don't show that

2936
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:06,560
it could

2937
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,119
um you could have

2938
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,239
if it did that i suppose you just

2939
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,400
wouldn't talk about it

2940
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,679
you know it's got a

2941
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,040
the when it goes a then it goes a i

2942
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,960
goes to ht

2943
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,280
sorry yeah it's a th yeah so we have a

2944
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,719
homeostat

2945
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:25,199
here we have two homeostats

2946
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:27,360
two homeostats and now here we have one

2947
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,239
homeostat and one allostat in this blue

2948
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,199
node

2949
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:34,000
and so that um

2950
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,760
but they're just kind of giving general

2951
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,280
examples like it would have been cool to

2952
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,480
see

2953
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:44,080
um this is where we're talking about

2954
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:44,880
um

2955
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,080
mammals

2956
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,480
and here's non-mammal vertebrates like

2957
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,440
here is a specific brain region and also

2958
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,400
that is

2959
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,679
in this um

2960
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,920
chakraborty and jarvis 2015 paper

2961
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,480
this paper um

2962
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,080
gets more into the nuances of

2963
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,199
neuroanatomy and neurogenetics

2964
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,360
and how like duplication

2965
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,599
in

2966
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,800
brain regions can be underpinned by

2967
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,679
developmental neurogenetic changes

2968
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,520
and they do link that a little bit more

2969
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,800
closely like to studying the bird brain

2970
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,520
and the song and motor

2971
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,679
system in parrots

2972
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:27,679
which is also cool because birdsong has

2973
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,520
been studied with active so like there

2974
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,360
could be a nice

2975
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,520
building upon this

2976
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,400
work and connecting it to some of the um

2977
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,679
structure

2978
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,920
fitting in figure five so it could

2979
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,199
almost be like you've got yeah you've

2980
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,880
got parts of the brain

2981
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,880
which are more

2982
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,280
allostatic orientated or homostatic

2983
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,199
orientated and

2984
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,960
that so in a way by

2985
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,440
the structuring of that

2986
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,320
gives

2987
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
some sort of differentiation in terms of

2988
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,440
how information and control will be

2989
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,880
carried out

2990
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,679
yeah totally and like um extending

2991
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,000
temporal depth within a model

2992
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,119
it's like a brain region getting a

2993
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,280
little bigger let's just say not that

2994
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,880
size is correlated with function in that

2995
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,199
specific way but then duplicating brain

2996
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:17,679
regions is like duplicating

2997
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:19,920
laterally or nesting of brain regions

2998
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,440
it's hierarchical

2999
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,239
think about how the eyes developed the

3000
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,080
insect eye

3001
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,960
it has a relatively simple

3002
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,159
module

3003
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:32,639
but then insect eyes can change in size

3004
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,199
over evolutionary time very radically

3005
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:36,880
from like taking up you know half of the

3006
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,840
head

3007
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
to being just one photoreceptor or even

3008
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
being lost

3009
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,679
because they're existing in more of a um

3010
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,000
duplicable motif

3011
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,840
whereas

3012
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,000
the binocular eye system that mammals

3013
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,119
have

3014
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,880
it's not as amenable to like just

3015
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,040
doubling into four eyes

3016
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,239
or

3017
01:49:58,239 --> 01:49:59,440
you know splitting into two in the

3018
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,960
middles or something like that whereas

3019
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,800
the insect compound eye has like some of

3020
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,960
those evolutionary affordances

3021
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,000
um

3022
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,040
so then

3023
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,960
understanding like parameter change

3024
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,480
within a model

3025
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,960
and then structure learning

3026
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,800
on populations of models and what are

3027
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,080
the mutational adjacencies

3028
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,719
there's so many awesome areas and it's

3029
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,719
like truly just beginning for

3030
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:25,840
evolutionary bio inactive stephen

3031
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,520
yeah it was really helpful like having

3032
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,119
someone like yourself who's got that

3033
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,440
background to go through that's quite

3034
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,199
helpful because it's a

3035
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:34,560
it's a little

3036
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,280
it's a little bit intimidating actually

3037
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,560
at first sight seeing this um for me but

3038
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,560
i and i see the logic what you're saying

3039
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,239
it's uh it's quite exciting actually

3040
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,000
seeing that and again one of the things

3041
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,920
this paper does is it's

3042
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,320
it's tying threads together

3043
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,639
so um which

3044
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,560
seem very distant in in or almost

3045
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,119
in traditional terms like

3046
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:00,159
well i don't like using the word

3047
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:03,199
kamikaze but it's a little bit like um

3048
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:06,159
yeah it's a bit bit overwhelming often

3049
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:07,760
so i think uh

3050
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,679
it's but but of course that's the beauty

3051
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,080
of um active is it has that unifying

3052
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,199
potential

3053
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,119
um so thanks

3054
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,199
cool yeah thank you i agree like there's

3055
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,119
some labeling

3056
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:21,440
this is rarely included unless it's a

3057
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,560
time calibrated phylogenetic tree but

3058
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,239
like we're looking at the passage of

3059
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:27,679
time

3060
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:30,719
but that's not even always shown and so

3061
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:31,840
um

3062
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,320
yes dean we'll have our final thoughts

3063
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,080
can you just go back to that because i i

3064
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,840
really i didn't prompt you to put that

3065
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,400
up there but i really like that because

3066
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,239
this at some point we're going to have

3067
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,960
to and point to talk about

3068
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,679
that sort of basal gating part of this

3069
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:50,159
and most things that are are

3070
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,040
are

3071
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,360
organized as if then cause allergy but

3072
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,320
you just said it it's then if

3073
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:00,159
go or don't go is very dependent on then

3074
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:01,520
before

3075
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,920
we choose to go or don't go right go or

3076
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,440
don't go is still

3077
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,920
held open until one of the others

3078
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,560
decided so

3079
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,639
another thank you for that because that

3080
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:15,360
again that in the point two

3081
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,880
we should maybe talk a little bit about

3082
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,040
that

3083
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,239
cool yeah there's so many ways to think

3084
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,560
about like this garden of forking paths

3085
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,280
branching paths

3086
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,440
how that relates to parameter updating

3087
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,119
bayesian belief updating and structure

3088
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:34,400
learning

3089
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,080
what about when the structure of a model

3090
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,960
is a parameter in a nested model

3091
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,280
so then that sort of blurs the line from

3092
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,880
the bottom looking up it looks like

3093
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,040
structure learning but then from the top

3094
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,719
looking down it looks like parameter

3095
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:47,599
fitting

3096
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:48,880
right

3097
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,880
and if only we had like some mathematics

3098
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,599
to describe that

3099
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,760
okay any

3100
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,719
final

3101
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:00,159
thoughts or what are we excited about

3102
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:03,040
for the dot two next week

3103
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,320
um well my last thought um is uh yeah

3104
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:07,840
i'm excited to keep this going because i

3105
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,360
think this has got a lot of legs to it

3106
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,159
um

3107
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,000
i think one thing that comes to mind as

3108
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,440
well with all this

3109
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,040
progressively

3110
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,920
um increased temporal and hierarchical

3111
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:18,800
depth

3112
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,520
is is maybe where some of the more basic

3113
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,679
uh elements still have a really useful

3114
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:26,239
part to play is is what mark mike levine

3115
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:28,880
said about when do we stop like so we've

3116
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,560
got all these ways where we can start to

3117
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,080
okay so we've got all these ways that we

3118
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,239
can think how do we know when to stop

3119
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,360
and to

3120
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,560
sit down i mean it may be in the

3121
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,480
ultimate ways between our tummy maybe

3122
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,719
that's where the gut is so useful like

3123
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,239
at the end of the day the brain can go

3124
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:43,840
running off and maybe the gut and the

3125
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,280
heart need to say

3126
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,119
okay

3127
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:48,239
sit down

3128
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,960
get some food so which i might well i'm

3129
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,639
gonna get a drink of honey now but uh

3130
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,560
i'll bid you for well thank you for a

3131
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,040
great dark time but i'll i'll i'll hear

3132
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,080
your last thoughts as well

3133
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,360
dean

3134
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,159
uh

3135
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,320
i hate having the last word so you won't

3136
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,800
have it don't worry you'll have it and i

3137
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,480
just appreciate what steven just said

3138
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,440
because i

3139
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,440
i think that that's a big part in this

3140
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,520
ability to go from word

3141
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,199
back into the phenomenological space and

3142
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,360
i think there are other other brains

3143
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,040
that we know of now

3144
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,040
that play a significant role in that not

3145
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,800
just the one that

3146
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,159
turns everything into symbols

3147
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,199
great

3148
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:32,719
my last thought is

3149
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,719
there's no better drink after a foraging

3150
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:37,840
trip than honey

3151
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,199
all right

3152
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:43,520
thank you and talk to you later

3153
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,320
bye

3154
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:47,320
bye
