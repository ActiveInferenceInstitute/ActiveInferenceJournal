00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,600
hello and welcome

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,720
to the active inference live stream my

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,800
name is daniel friedman and this is

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,760
going to be a

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
solo discussion if you're a new listener

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,440
or not

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,400
welcome to team com we are an experiment

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
in online team communication and

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,880
learning

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,199
related to active inference you can find

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,320
us on twitter

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,279
at inferenceactive at activeinference

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
gmail.com

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,199
on key base via our public team or our

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,800
youtube channel

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
this is a recorded and archived live

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,160
stream

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
so please provide us with feedback so

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
that we can improve our work

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
all backgrounds and perspectives are

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
welcome here

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
and also as far as video etiquette goes

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
remember to mute if there's noise in the

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,480
background

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
raise your hand if you have a question

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
and so on

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
here we are in act imp stream number 5.0

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
we're kind of exploring with the

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
numbering system so give us any

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
feedback as far as what kinds of numbers

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
or what kinds of shows might be helpful

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,120
for

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
your learning but the goal for this

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,040
discussion is to set the context for

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,760
active in

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
stream 5.1 in 5.1

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
we're going to discuss the paper

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,720
multi-scale integration

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,520
beyond internalism and externalism by

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,799
ramstead at all 2019.

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
the goal of this video is really to

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,119
contextualize some of the ideas

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
the historical threads and the

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,119
vocabulary that will help you either

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,240
read or work with the ramstead paper uh

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,439
in terms of other

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,880
fields that you might be more familiar

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,040
with or just to sort of connect ideas

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,360
and thus ground your understanding and

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,320
your practice

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
so i come from a different background

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
from the author so i have a slightly

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,759
different perspective on

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
perhaps even the implications of the

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
paper so the goal here is really just to

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
explore that

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,759
so that whether you listen to this by

58
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,560
itself

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
and you're looking to sort of see where

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
active inference is trying to relate

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,799
itself to other philosophical ideas

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,960
or whether you're coming from the active

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
inference side and you want to

64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
understand some of the broader

65
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,360
philosophical questions

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
that are being addressed potentially by

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
active inference in both those cases i

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,239
hope this is an interesting

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
video for you so here are a few of the

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
topics that we'll be

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
exploring here the first one is top-down

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,360
and bottom-up causation and that's going

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,680
to be an introduction to multi-level

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
systems as well as thinking about

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,959
causal modeling also

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
next we'll talk about and raise some

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,000
questions

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
related to partitioning between internal

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,239
and external cognition

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
which is certainly the wedge or the main

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,840
issue

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
that the ramps that at all paper is

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
going to be focused on

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
and then we'll talk about a few

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
different perspectives on systems

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,560
modeling

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
and action that's sort of action and

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,760
inference

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
if you will but there's also been a lot

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
of philosophical thought

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
on systems modeling as well as action so

92
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
we can kind of see how those two fields

93
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,159
might come together

94
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,200
in the field called active inference and

95
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,400
next time in number 5.1

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
we will all come together everybody who

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
wants to can always get in touch with us

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,239
we will all come together

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
and discuss the paper to whatever extent

100
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,599
we've read it

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,200
whatever we thought about it any

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
questions that we wanted to address

103
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
any of our background knowledge uh any

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
of our perspectives that we bring to the

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,879
paper those are all cool things

106
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,080
to come about in 5.1 and if you're

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,640
listening to this after 5.1 has happened

108
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
you can either listen to 5.1 or you

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
could get in touch with us to be on a

110
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,239
future

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
discussion so next time in

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,400
5.1 we're going to be talking about the

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
figures to abstract etc

114
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
in this paper by ramstead at all called

115
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,760
multi-scale

116
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
integration beyond internalism and

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
externalism and that's in the journal

118
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
synthes in 2019

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
so the goal of that paper and the only

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,239
quotes from the paper

121
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
that are going to be in this video are

122
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
just from the introduction

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
and abstract just so that we can ground

124
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,879
the

125
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,280
ideas more specifically in what ramps

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
that at all

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
frame their work asp so the goal of the

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
paper in the author's

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
words was we focus on making

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
explicit a description of the boundaries

131
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
of cognitive systems

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
that we think follows from taking

133
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
seriously the inactive

134
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
embodied and extended nature of

135
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
cognition

136
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
this is the idea that the boundaries of

137
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,919
cognitive systems

138
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
are nested and multiple and that with

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
respect to its study

140
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,840
cognition has no fixed or essential

141
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
boundaries

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
cool i think that that is really

143
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
exciting and also

144
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
it doesn't necessarily bring the free

145
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
energy principle or active inference

146
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
on too heavily it just helps understand

147
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
what is the broader

148
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
goal of the paper well the question

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,360
that really excited me today was this

150
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
taking it seriously aspect on

151
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
multi-scale integration

152
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
it's the first two words of the paper's

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
title

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
so maybe they're trying to signal with

155
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
that the story that we want to be

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,919
working towards is multi-scale

157
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
integration so

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
linking things that are different

159
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
spatial and temporal scales

160
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,680
at once multi-scale how are we going to

161
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,000
do

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
that multi-scale integration well what

163
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,520
they're

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
provocatively stating in the title is

165
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
that we must move beyond

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
this debate of internalism versus

167
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
externalism which i'll contextualize

168
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,960
soon

169
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
and the way that they're going to take

170
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
it seriously is using a mathematical

171
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,360
framework

172
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
called free energy principle and it's

173
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
related process theory

174
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
active inference so that's what taking

175
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
it seriously looks like for them

176
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
especially drawing on their background

177
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
as cognitive science

178
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,120
experts they're really framing this as

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
about multi-scale cognition

180
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,160
and i came from a not a cognitive

181
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,199
sciences background

182
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
more of an evolutionary biology

183
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,400
background and so

184
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,880
multi-scale integration in the ant

185
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
colony or in the insect brain or in the

186
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
cell

187
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
there's a different set of philosophical

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
baggage that comes along with it

189
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,919
sometimes if i could characterize it so

190
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
clearly would be the focus on humans

191
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
tends to focus on the experience

192
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
and the internal view since we are human

193
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
so at the very least it's one of the

194
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
ways that we can study

195
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
emergencies by ourself as an emergent

196
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
process whereas in

197
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
computers ant colonies the cell there's

198
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,120
often

199
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
a tendency following let's just say

200
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,720
dennit

201
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
and others to imagine it as an automata

202
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
or just sort of a robot

203
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,280
and therefore devoid of experience or

204
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
specularity

205
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
sorry speculatively having experience

206
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
but sort of on the sci-fi fringe and

207
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,039
anyways when you deal with the system

208
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,319
you have to be in that intentional

209
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,199
stance

210
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
so those types of systems tend to have

211
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,919
perspectives that are devoid of agency

212
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
whereas human systems the debate is just

213
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,199
about that

214
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
is about our own agency but we're all

215
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
part of the same multi-skill integrated

216
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
framework and so we want to have a story

217
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
that works for cells that are in our gut

218
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
that are in the uh in our gut lumen in

219
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
the microbiome why should it matter why

220
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,919
should we have a different theory of

221
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,319
biology for one side of that over the

222
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
other especially when we know that

223
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,319
there's

224
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,000
important transfer between them for

225
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
example so

226
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
the authors took it seriously and they

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
wrote this 2019 paper as well as other

228
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,039
papers

229
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
i'm gonna try to take this seriously

230
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,080
from

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
the work in biology that i have learned

232
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,919
about

233
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
over the years and that's what taking it

234
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
seriously and contextualizing looks like

235
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,919
to me so i just thought i could start

236
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
with that

237
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,039
here's a paper from 2012 by dennis noble

238
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
who's a great systems biologist

239
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
called a theory of biological relativity

240
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,319
no privileged level of causation so you

241
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,199
can kind of see

242
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
where he's going which is taking the

243
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,879
idea of relativity

244
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
whether that's gravitational relativity

245
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
something related to quantum mechanics

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,919
for example

247
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
or just uh inter-subjective relativity

248
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
like focusing on the relations that

249
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
define something or the interactions

250
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,759
that define a person

251
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,560
rather than an essentialist take so

252
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
noble is sort of taking

253
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
a broad understanding of relativity and

254
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
saying well if we really look at

255
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
multi-scale systems and spatial and

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,479
temporal cause

257
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
then there's going to be this relativity

258
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
principle maybe that could apply to

259
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,520
biology

260
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,639
and what i like about his figure one

261
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
and i've added two wrongs at the top is

262
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,320
that it really clearly phrases what he's

263
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,839
arguing against

264
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,719
and also makes it clear um how some of

265
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,120
these

266
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
logical errors become deployed in real

267
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
systems in real analyses

268
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,360
so figure one is a

269
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
model of causation for what's called

270
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
upward causation

271
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
and the way to read this figure is it

272
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
starts at the bottom

273
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
with the smallest thing which are genes

274
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,760
which here

275
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
is just i believe being meant as a

276
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
string of dna but that's a whole other

277
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
discussion

278
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,680
let's just say that genes uh are able to

279
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
cause proteins in rna which are another

280
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
scale of organization bigger moving up

281
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
towards protein and rna networks

282
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
up through cells tissues organs

283
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,880
organisms

284
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
social interactions ecological

285
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
technological

286
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
governance informational systems and so

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
on so this is a

288
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,839
sort of multi-scale systems perspective

289
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,120
and the

290
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
version of events that we often

291
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
get is implicitly one of what noble

292
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
is characterizing accurately as upward

293
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
causation

294
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
one could change the spatial metaphor it

295
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,959
could be moving downwards it could be

296
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
moving inwards or outwards

297
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
but suffice to say that this is what we

298
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,040
mean when we say upward causation is

299
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,680
really

300
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
from small things to big things because

301
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
the top down things are often seen as

302
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,240
big

303
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
and the things that are just on the

304
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
fabric level of reality are often seen

305
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,399
as small

306
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
rightly or wrongly um and

307
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,959
the the story when you have this type of

308
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,680
a

309
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
upward causation model again that

310
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
smaller things cause bigger things

311
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
is the the genes are upstream of the

312
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
behavior or

313
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,440
um the uh the cell damage is upstream of

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,079
the

315
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
organs so it makes sense and there's

316
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
also a related idea called supervenience

317
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
that is that

318
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,959
is there a relationship between changing

319
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
the smaller thing and the bigger thing

320
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,519
changing

321
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,040
so these are the kinds of questions that

322
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
come up and this is one

323
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
direction of causation however what

324
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,279
noble

325
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
ends up framing in this uh no

326
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
privileged level of causation model is

327
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
that yes there is

328
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
influence or flow from so-called the

329
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
upward direction so that's the genes

330
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
and uh going all the way up in

331
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,279
influencing things that are at larger

332
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,160
scale

333
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
but also in a very real and causal sense

334
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
there are top-down causation

335
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
that can be equally important for

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
regulating the system so even if in the

337
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,079
short time scale

338
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,120
the in uh influence of the bottom up is

339
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
extremely strong if there's no top-down

340
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
force sometimes

341
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,480
any amount of bottom-up power can just

342
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
cause the system to dissipate and

343
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
therefore not exist

344
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
so in that sense all systems that we

345
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
observe continuing to dissipate energy

346
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
for example like active inference

347
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,360
foragers informational foragers

348
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
humans living creatures we can

349
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,800
really start to see that there has to be

350
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
some sort of a top-down organizing force

351
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
otherwise it would be like a land uh

352
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
slide or a lightning strike it would

353
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
just dissipate away

354
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
so he says look because the top-down

355
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
forces are so important

356
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
and over evolutionary time end up

357
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,279
shaping the parameters and the set of

358
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
what is possible or functional at the

359
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,079
lower level

360
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,160
it really needs to have an equal hand

361
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
causally so

362
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,240
we also need to look at this from a

363
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,399
top-down bottom-up perspective

364
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
lots of people have thought about these

365
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
types of issues in systems theories

366
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
and in other areas but the three areas

367
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
that um i just want to emphasize here

368
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
before bridging to active inference

369
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,360
are that there's a continuum of larger

370
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
and smaller things

371
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,000
that has to basically be true because

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
you can't have something bigger inside

373
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,760
of something smaller

374
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,839
and in the context of this debate that

375
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,800
we're framing

376
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,279
uh to get set up for which is between

377
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
internalism and externalism

378
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
you can think about things that are

379
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
bigger as being more external and things

380
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
that are smaller as being more internal

381
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,720
so like the story about the smaller

382
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
things is going into the organ into the

383
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,200
cells

384
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
into our cells but the story going out

385
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
is about the ecosystem or the

386
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
the constructed niche and these are

387
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
things that are external

388
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
and so that's gonna come back later in

389
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
the paper

390
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
and then also um as a consequence of

391
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
that there's this nestedness

392
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
or this embeddedness to these different

393
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,839
levels of analysis

394
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
and there's again many vocabularies for

395
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,720
this type of recursive or embedded

396
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
system and hopefully we'll address some

397
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,959
but also

398
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,040
feel free to provide feedback these are

399
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,959
just some of the general aspects of

400
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,480
multi-scale systems

401
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
and some of the questions about

402
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
multi-scale systems that the paper is

403
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,839
going to address eventually

404
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,760
and the field of research but also

405
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
there's some philosophical work from

406
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
areas other than the inactive cognitive

407
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
area all right so the

408
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
next topic is going to be about

409
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
partitioning between internal and

410
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,560
external cognition which is another way

411
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,120
of

412
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
saying what is the internalism versus

413
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
externalism debate about how are we

414
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
going to move beyond that

415
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,720
how might the free energy principle be

416
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
involved in that

417
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,680
and in a sense the question that this is

418
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240
asking

419
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
is how do we do causal modeling of

420
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
situations

421
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
where internal and external states

422
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,079
interact for example

423
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,760
through sense and action so let's think

424
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
about how sense and action are

425
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
interacting even at one level of

426
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,720
analysis what the ant

427
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
perceives for example in its actions

428
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
what you perceive and its actions

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
and then immediately one of the

430
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
questions that many people

431
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,399
have asked is okay so how do we make

432
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,360
that story

433
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
multi-level because the ant we could

434
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,399
simulate

435
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
it as just a robot with inputs and

436
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
outputs and sort of black box inside but

437
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,279
it

438
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
is also composed of the tissues and the

439
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
cells and it seems a little bit

440
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
ridiculous if we would have to simulate

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,560
from the cell

442
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,160
up to the ecosystem level so we have to

443
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
be able to

444
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
separate that model somewhere even if

445
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,040
only

446
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,600
for computational tractability or

447
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,120
comprehensibility so we got to make this

448
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
trade-off between

449
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
making causal models of systems that are

450
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,199
at one level of analysis

451
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,120
but including things that are at a

452
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
smaller level of analysis

453
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
that can have consequences that bubble

454
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
up for example a

455
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
drug binding to a receptor can bubble up

456
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,440
to behavior

457
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
that's like a story about upward

458
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
causation or someone's choice or

459
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,639
someone's context

460
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
could dictate their physiology through

461
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
any number of mechanisms which food or

462
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
molecules are available

463
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,760
so there is going to be times where that

464
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
cross-level interaction

465
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
is really important for the stories that

466
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
we tell for the narratives that how we

467
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,000
understand

468
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
the world um how we communicate about

469
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,360
those things so

470
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
how does the multi-level perspective

471
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
relate to causal modeling

472
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
if your story is about two people who

473
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
are fighting is the story only going to

474
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,199
be at that level or are you going to

475
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
bring in society are you going to bring

476
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
in the molecular

477
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,839
stuff how how much upper and lower

478
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
context do you provide for causal

479
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,880
modeling at a given

480
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
level of analysis

481
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,079
how is causal modeling related to the

482
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
possible actions of a system

483
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
also known as the adjacent possible

484
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,000
for example what else could be and this

485
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,519
just kind of reminds me of how when

486
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,560
someone describes

487
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
a near-miss or a situation that could

488
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
have been another way

489
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
they're not saying it could have been

490
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
any any other way

491
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
this thought experiment has been carried

492
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
out by gould

493
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
and others in the sense that yeah

494
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,759
something

495
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
happened a certain way which means it

496
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,440
was permitted by reality

497
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
and then you're envisioning a slightly

498
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
different scenario for example

499
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
the ball hits the other side of the roof

500
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
and it ends up rolling down a different

501
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,600
direction

502
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
doing some other outcome and the ball

503
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
still has the same physics and you're

504
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
still the same person so it's not any

505
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
alternate reality

506
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
it's a very tightly constrained causal

507
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,959
reality and what kinds of

508
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
alternate realities do people propose or

509
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,000
speculate

510
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,560
about ones that are within the causal

511
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
latent model of the world

512
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
where all stories where you cross the

513
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
freeway are dangerous for example

514
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
so that's the causal model that

515
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
underlies what we

516
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,040
genuinely generally are talking about

517
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
when we're talking about

518
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
what could happen we're not saying

519
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
anything could happen we're seeing a

520
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,160
pretty tight model

521
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
given about how we think about cause and

522
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,279
effect in the system

523
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,480
why is causal modeling so important to

524
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,839
active inference and there's two

525
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
roads into this i would say one

526
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,439
perspective

527
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,160
is why is causal modeling important from

528
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,520
the point of view the organism and

529
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,000
another

530
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
would be of the scientist or the

531
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,039
observer so

532
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,599
first from the point of the organism

533
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,119
there's a lot of ways to

534
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,079
frame exactly what it is an animal does

535
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,959
and a really

536
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,360
common area that people study this

537
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,840
without the

538
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,799
psycho baggage is in animal foraging

539
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,640
so whether it's a rodent or an ant

540
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
people or a bird people are really

541
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,919
interested

542
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,960
in the bioenergetics of and the

543
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,000
decision-making

544
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,039
that underlies how the animal uh goes

545
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
about searching for food

546
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
and how does that depend on the dynamics

547
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,720
of the ecosystem

548
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
and so one popular framework

549
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,039
in studying foraging is optimal foraging

550
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,520
theory

551
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,600
which you can just by the name of it

552
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
imagine is kind of like optimal

553
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
investing

554
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
strategy and there's a lot of variations

555
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
on it but it's just saying

556
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
what the ant is trying to do or what the

557
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
bird is trying to do

558
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
is given the costs and the benefits or

559
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
as estimated by the bird the predicted

560
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,200
costs and benefits

561
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
of the environment and the processing

562
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
time it's going to do this

563
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,559
reward maximization and

564
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,600
the good news about that approach is it

565
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
often works a lot of times animals are

566
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
near their predicted efficiency uh

567
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,559
however other times

568
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,200
it can be quite far off and it's not

569
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,120
exactly apparent why that might be

570
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
perhaps some constraint exists that was

571
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,919
not modeled

572
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
and so the reward maximization idea

573
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,360
often

574
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
succeeds or it captures a story or an

575
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
important variable about a foraging

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,640
system

577
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
as you might expect but it doesn't

578
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,559
really go the full way

579
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,120
in explaining how the model is embodied

580
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,880
or carried out by the animal

581
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
because it doesn't necessarily have the

582
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,919
kind of

583
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,720
computational processing that a human

584
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,919
simulation might

585
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
not to compare the brain or the niche to

586
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
a computer

587
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,720
but just to say that that even as a

588
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
physical computer imagined

589
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,600
is still something that's quite

590
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
different than the models that are being

591
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
used to study

592
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
the error divergence by which ultimately

593
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
people are going to be asking whether

594
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
the

595
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
strategy was optimal in terms of its

596
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
reward or not

597
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,240
what active inference does is it says

598
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
right the overall reward model is

599
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,679
intractable it

600
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
contains variables that are inaccessible

601
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
or just not realistic

602
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
for the nematode to be calculating for

603
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
example in any way

604
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
directly but what the animal can be

605
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
doing is

606
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
engaging in this cycle between action

607
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
and perception and so it

608
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,679
is making these sensory hypotheses about

609
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,799
the world

610
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
embodied through action so for example

611
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
the eyes are circading around very

612
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
rapidly

613
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
where are they moving they're moving to

614
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,840
where your brain predict predicts that

615
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
you need to resolve your uncertainty

616
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,520
about your visual field

617
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
most so that's why even though your

618
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
actual visual resolution

619
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
on your retina or the density of the

620
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
cells the ability to perceive

621
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,799
the fine granularity of vision is quite

622
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,720
different across the back of your eye

623
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,559
yet the whole visual field unless you

624
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,200
have some sort of visual alteration

625
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
is uniformly clear and doesn't have a

626
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
blind spot so that's

627
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,880
evidence that at least visually we're in

628
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,159
a generative model

629
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,559
of what's happening and it shouldn't be

630
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,280
too far

631
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
away to say that that's what other

632
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
animals are also having at least

633
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
visually with a total secondary question

634
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
of whether it's experiential or not but

635
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
just visually

636
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,520
so active inference is a process theory

637
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,000
that

638
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
we can go into more another time that

639
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
has to do with

640
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
how organisms actually act in their

641
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
ecological niche

642
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,039
to resolve their uncertainty about the

643
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,400
kinds of problems they actually need to

644
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
resolve

645
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
therefore framing things like foraging

646
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
as a reward

647
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,159
obtaining but a precision maximization

648
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
behavior sequence and that framing turns

649
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,080
out to have

650
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,880
big implications so just wanted to frame

651
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,520
it that way

652
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,440
as far as the scientist's active

653
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
inference

654
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
the scientist also from an informational

655
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,039
perspective

656
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,840
has to think about which hypotheses

657
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,320
they're

658
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
experimenting or modeling with to reduce

659
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,840
their uncertainty

660
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,120
about what and just

661
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
as in active inference where the

662
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,799
generative model of the internal

663
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,880
state the organism in this example the

664
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,840
scientist

665
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
the internal model includes a generative

666
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,039
model of the latent causes in the world

667
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,200
and understanding the latent causes

668
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
better is what facilitates

669
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,039
uh better action and also better

670
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,480
experiments and

671
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
hopefully clearer transmission as well

672
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
how does the markov blanket idea come

673
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,159
into play

674
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,880
what pierces the blanket so here any

675
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,240
figure that you look at

676
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,720
of the markov blanket is going to have

677
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
uh basically the active inference

678
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
cycle with a markov blanket superimposed

679
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
down the middle

680
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
there's internal and external states and

681
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
then external states influence

682
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
sensory states sensory states influence

683
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,559
internal states

684
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,840
internal states have their own

685
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,960
autonomous or self-influencing dynamics

686
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,159
and through policy selection end up

687
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
implementing action states for example

688
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
the movement of an arm

689
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,919
action states influence the external

690
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
states the world states for example

691
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
which are also of course involved in

692
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
their own dynamics

693
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
the markov blanket is pierced on one

694
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,039
side by sense coming

695
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
in and by action on the other side going

696
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,320
out

697
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
and then the whole multi-scale question

698
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
is going to be about applying that

699
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
markov blanket all the way down idea

700
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
taking that seriously as far as

701
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,280
cognition one other area

702
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
that i thought could be kind of

703
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
interesting to relate this to would be

704
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
like other partitioning problems and

705
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
another partitioning problem that comes

706
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,280
up in

707
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,679
biological philosophy realms is this

708
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,000
question of nature versus nurture

709
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
and here i would point people towards

710
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
two

711
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
pretty recent and excellent books on the

712
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
left is beyond versus the struggle to

713
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,320
understand the interaction of nature and

714
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,039
nurture

715
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,280
by james tabary and then on the right

716
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,600
the mirage of a space between

717
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,400
nature and nurture by evelyn fox keller

718
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,799
and

719
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,600
they both have a different perspective

720
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,880
on the same question but

721
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
in in both cases there's this idea of

722
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,559
moving beyond

723
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,120
the binary partitioning of nature and

724
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,000
nurture and

725
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,320
so here in the ramstead 2019 paper

726
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,400
the framing of internalism and

727
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
externalism where they're sort of

728
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,080
entering into this stack is at the level

729
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
of cognition it's about cognitive

730
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,880
entities

731
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
whereas here's a partitioning problem in

732
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
the area of genetics

733
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
and in environmental and developmental

734
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,279
studies for example

735
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
and here's an example of where similar

736
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
internalism

737
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
internals the genes right smaller things

738
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,000
or externalism

739
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
outside bigger things the ecosystem is

740
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,919
seen as bigger than the person

741
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
with this implicit focused level of

742
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
analysis on the individual

743
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,360
and so um just to draw on evelyn fox

744
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
keller's book

745
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
she uses a metaphor of different kinds

746
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
of tasks and how

747
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,120
even if you just had two people so the

748
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,039
same type of agent

749
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,919
if you had two people building a brick

750
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,520
wall together you could at the end of

751
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,000
the day

752
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
say well this person added so and so

753
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
many bricks and this person added the

754
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
rest of the bricks

755
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
and so maybe you could say well 40 of

756
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
the work on this wall was performed by

757
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
that person

758
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
however imagine a situation where two

759
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
people are needed to hold

760
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,640
a hose to fill up a bucket for example

761
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
even if one of the rules requires a

762
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,679
specialty

763
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,279
or more training or some other attribute

764
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
even in that case that person can't do

765
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
it alone

766
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
so no matter how much water comes

767
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,080
through that hose and it's all water

768
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
coming through the hose

769
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,120
you're never going to be able to say

770
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
well 80 of the water was due to person a

771
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,480
and 20 percent was due to person b

772
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,600
so she uses that really clear metaphor

773
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
to describe the relationship between

774
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,799
nature and nurture

775
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
how they're obviously related there is

776
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,320
no such thing as a

777
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,919
uh niche free organism especially when

778
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,960
you think about this from an

779
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
evolutionary

780
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
ecology or ultimately active inference

781
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
perspective

782
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,480
organisms and their niche are what

783
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,440
fitness is about

784
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
that is what is being fit to what is the

785
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,039
organism to their niche

786
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,120
and you don't see things that aren't fit

787
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,960
so it's unsurprising that we're

788
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
finally attuned to things in our niche

789
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
also there was a one interesting section

790
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,440
in mirage of a space between where she

791
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
traces the linguistic origins of the

792
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,320
framing

793
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
nature versus nurture because everyone

794
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
has heard the phrase nature versus

795
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
nurture is it nature or is it nurture

796
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,279
or it's in our dna it's in our nature

797
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,039
how did things come to be in this verses

798
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
sense that's also alluded to in the

799
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,240
title

800
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,919
of tabari's book and what fox

801
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
keller writes is recently a fashion has

802
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
arisen for tracing

803
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
the phrase nature and nurture and the

804
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,159
debate with which that phrase is

805
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,039
associated

806
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,880
back to shakespeare or at least to

807
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,679
prospero in the tempest

808
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:35,840
1623 who writes off caliban as

809
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
uneducable

810
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
quoting shakespeare a born devil on

811
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,799
whose nature

812
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,080
slash nurture will never stick

813
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
back to fox killer some have traced it

814
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,440
further

815
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
back to a monograph on children's

816
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
education written by an elizabethan

817
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,320
pedagogue

818
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,440
richard mulcaster mulcaster's words were

819
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,240
nature makes boy towered nurture sees

820
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
him forward

821
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,120
maybe it rhymes in another pronunciation

822
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,559
it's from 1581 and then

823
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,440
she concludes but in fact although both

824
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
molecaster

825
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
and shakespeare juxtapose the workings

826
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,919
of nature and nurture

827
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
neither invokes the term as an explicit

828
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,320
conjunction so not an or

829
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,880
they do not write of nature and nurture

830
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,000
as such

831
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,679
so they don't separate them and they

832
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,080
don't um make them

833
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,159
contra distincted versus each other

834
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,399
indeed when we look more closely at what

835
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,240
they do right we can see that their use

836
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,080
of the two terms does not invite

837
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
such a conjunction for there is no

838
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
presumption of an a priori disjunction

839
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,559
so what she's getting at there is

840
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,679
there really is no need to do an

841
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,840
argument against the concept of nature

842
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
and nurture

843
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
it's kind of like writing a hit article

844
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
on somebody who you disagree with

845
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
people who understand that there has to

846
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,039
be a move beyond

847
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,080
verses beyond an oppositional framing

848
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,279
of nature and nurture those people

849
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,399
should be and are making their positive

850
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,120
arguments

851
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,679
for why it should be framed a different

852
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,480
way

853
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
where the nature and the nurture are

854
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
things that are pulled out

855
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
or controlled for specifically and

856
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,440
transparently

857
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
in specific systems so that's an example

858
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
about how the philosophy of science

859
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
for example how we think about the

860
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,760
partition between internal and external

861
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,480
states

862
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,120
of phenotype relates to how we think

863
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,039
about multi-scale systems overall

864
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,200
because i think okay it reminds me so

865
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,440
much of this internalism and externalism

866
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,960
in cognitive sciences debate

867
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
reminds me a lot of this historical

868
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,240
debate in

869
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,880
genetics all right

870
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,320
next section perspectives on systems

871
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
modeling

872
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,240
and action and here the motivating

873
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,960
question

874
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
is about how do we carve nature at the

875
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,279
joints which is

876
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,600
a quote attributed to plato in the

877
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,799
phaedrus

878
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,480
allegedly and the quote alludes to

879
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,679
this idea that nature whether

880
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
one thinks that systems can be defined

881
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,600
tightly and they're just on their own

882
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,000
billiard

883
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,799
ball trajectory or whether one has a

884
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
relational perspective where there's

885
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
just these

886
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,640
multi-level networks of relations and

887
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
being and becoming

888
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,360
whatever it is at some point we want to

889
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,799
carve it at the joints

890
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
because otherwise we're going to get

891
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
swept up in the storm

892
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
and people will often hold that that's

893
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
not their position

894
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
or that they don't want to carve systems

895
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,279
at the joints but i think

896
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,640
if you're listening to this i hope you

897
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,480
can see that

898
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
at some point at least in action you

899
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,679
have to be

900
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
dealing with nature at the joints so to

901
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,600
speak are they the right ones or not

902
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,760
isn't that the whole question so

903
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,679
one thing that is a connection is

904
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,240
we can ask how is the fep the free

905
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
energy principle

906
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
or active inference going to help us

907
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,600
frame this problem of carving

908
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,240
nature at the joints this is kind of one

909
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
of the big

910
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
ideas from a philosophical perspective

911
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
is about classification and about

912
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,320
distinguishing

913
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,279
things whether it's objects or types of

914
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,320
processes

915
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,520
or um ideas distinguishing

916
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,720
things and those are part of nature is

917
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
part of philosophy and so coming back to

918
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,320
this

919
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
essential question of carving nature of

920
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,919
the joint and then

921
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,480
asking well how can we use things like

922
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,200
fep

923
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,000
active inference to frame the problem

924
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,039
structurally

925
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,520
to give us in ontology and in fact in

926
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
the paper they'll talk about an ontology

927
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,840
and

928
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,559
subsequent work also um worked on

929
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,480
ontologies

930
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,399
so that's sort of the big motivation

931
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,600
it's why

932
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,279
this quote is being brought up in the

933
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,720
context of this paper we're about to

934
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,279
discuss

935
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,600
because the whole point is about us

936
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,039
carving nature at the joints

937
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,360
so let's go a little bit deeper into

938
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
systems modeling and carving nature at

939
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
the joints

940
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,640
and the question is how are descriptive

941
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
we'll just call that type 1

942
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,720
and action oriented type 2 models

943
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,840
related or different

944
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,559
and so just to explain what those 1 and

945
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,559
2 are

946
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,519
by descriptive model i mean a system

947
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,440
description only and so two

948
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
examples just to sort of pin down the

949
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
qualitative to quantitative

950
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,399
spectrum the first mention here is to

951
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,760
bruno latour's

952
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,039
actor network theory or ant and

953
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,080
it's an awesome piece of maybe

954
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,399
meta sociology not sure exactly what the

955
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,760
torah would call it

956
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
that just says the way to approach the

957
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
system is by

958
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
showing up finding out what are the

959
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
traces and

960
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,519
being open with respect to which actors

961
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,360
are involved in which processes through

962
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,840
which

963
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,320
networks of influence so it's a very

964
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,200
unbiased

965
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
description or moving towards unbiased

966
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
not to step into that sort of uh

967
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
trap i guess and then um

968
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
it's very qualitative it's relational

969
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,840
it's also about

970
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,640
the observers knowing and relationship

971
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,519
with the system

972
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,039
not just the way that aspects of the

973
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,600
system are associated with each other so

974
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,559
often those things are left out in

975
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,880
quantitative or in some scientific

976
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
world use and on the other end of the

977
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
system's description

978
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,880
only spectrum i've pointed to

979
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
a package of complex systems

980
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
design tools called cadcad now cad cad

981
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,600
goes beyond

982
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
systems description it turns out to also

983
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,880
be able to do things like

984
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,399
simulation and and other

985
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,960
more dynamical approaches like signal

986
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,840
processing

987
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,320
but what i mean by putting cad cad here

988
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,679
is that it can be used

989
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,200
purely depictively to specify a complex

990
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,679
system

991
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,159
especially one that's computational so

992
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:54,880
there might be

993
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,399
a question when you're actually trying

994
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,200
to model a organic ecosystem

995
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,640
of how do you measure some every single

996
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,799
uh you know piece of the ecosystem and

997
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,360
how many variables is enough to describe

998
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
the fineness of the temperature gradient

999
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
or something like that

1000
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
but when the simulation is about a

1001
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
digital system

1002
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,080
it can be more deterministically and

1003
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,120
controllably

1004
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,000
simulated if one can imagine so there's

1005
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
one type of world modeling related to

1006
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,960
system description

1007
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
but that obviously enables simulation

1008
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,039
and inference as well

1009
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,120
the second kind of models are

1010
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
action-oriented models

1011
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,039
so action-oriented models are those

1012
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,600
where

1013
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
ultimately we're just we're assigning

1014
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
meaning to states

1015
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,559
voting with your fee voting with your

1016
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,159
dollars it's

1017
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,279
when we want to have effective action or

1018
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,080
at least

1019
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
the system acts like it wants to

1020
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,519
something like maybe what dennett would

1021
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,360
call the intentional stance

1022
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,159
so the descriptive modeling might be a

1023
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,080
question that you're asking the computer

1024
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,200
like given this scatter of points which

1025
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,279
axes capture the most statistical

1026
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,559
variants

1027
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,559
and that would be just it running some

1028
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
sort of algorithm to find the maximum

1029
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,600
variance explained

1030
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,239
whereas a another type of algorithm like

1031
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,280
more of a type 2

1032
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,839
action-oriented algorithm might be learn

1033
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,440
the relationship between

1034
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,839
this input and the optimal performing

1035
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,639
behavior

1036
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,320
in the output so that's what

1037
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,839
action-oriented models are about

1038
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,480
next question how does the multi-level

1039
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,280
perspective influence our answers above

1040
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,599
so if we're going to have a story where

1041
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,440
there's nature's being carved at its

1042
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
joints maybe around the markov blankets

1043
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
maybe with scents coming in and action

1044
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,239
coming out

1045
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
even if we have that at one level so we

1046
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
have an asian-based model of the ants

1047
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
that are bumping into each other and at

1048
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
one level

1049
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,918
the sense of one is the action of

1050
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,839
another and so we have a sort of

1051
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,119
bumper car model um where does the

1052
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,399
multi-level perspective

1053
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,879
come into play and that's kind of

1054
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,399
thinking about the bumper car one it's

1055
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,359
where you would model

1056
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,119
first the cars bumping into each other

1057
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,119
and then you could go into the engine

1058
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,280
or you could go out to the power grid

1059
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,720
and to the people who are

1060
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,400
riding on the bumper cars or something

1061
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
like that so

1062
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
how are we going to deal with the

1063
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,760
complexity of causal stories

1064
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,560
relationships

1065
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,960
some of what might which uh be really

1066
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,920
important

1067
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,800
and like the example of a molecule that

1068
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
binds to a receptor

1069
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
others which might be spurious and the

1070
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
reality is that because of the

1071
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,839
combinatorics

1072
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,400
most of the options across levels will

1073
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,760
be spurious

1074
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
so most of the ecological relationships

1075
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,000
can't be for example

1076
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,839
one-to-one because there's so many that

1077
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,280
are just bumping into each other all the

1078
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,079
time

1079
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,240
just to give one example from ecology so

1080
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,760
how are we going to carve nature at its

1081
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,400
joints

1082
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
do it cleanly are we trying to represent

1083
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,560
stuff like one are we trying to act like

1084
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,359
two

1085
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,280
do one and two fall out as a function of

1086
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
doing one do we get

1087
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,680
one and two as a function of following

1088
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,160
out just two

1089
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
how does emergence and emergent

1090
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
properties fit into all of this

1091
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,000
so by emergence or emergent properties

1092
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,280
people often mean

1093
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
a sort of system outcome where there's

1094
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,560
some property or characteristic

1095
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,160
or attribute that is arising at a higher

1096
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,640
level

1097
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,960
again bigger broader spatial and

1098
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
temporal scales

1099
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,880
based upon interactions or some sort of

1100
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
interfacing

1101
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,520
of the smaller level so sometimes these

1102
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
emergent properties

1103
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,359
using the classification here of badao

1104
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,000
are

1105
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
in the weak category and in the strong

1106
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,599
category it's not the only way to break

1107
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,000
down

1108
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,079
immersions not to only take here but i

1109
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,160
find this one pretty helpful

1110
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
first strong emergence badao equates

1111
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,680
with basically magic

1112
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,560
you can read the papers more if you want

1113
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,960
to

1114
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
explore more nuance but the strong

1115
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,560
emergence is from

1116
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,400
something that's totally disjoint to

1117
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
something that's

1118
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,119
has a total integrity like language or

1119
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,599
awareness for example and then weak

1120
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,000
emergence is contrasted and that's most

1121
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,400
of the

1122
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
physical systems where even if the

1123
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
relationships between subunits are

1124
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,040
really nuanced

1125
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
or the computational uh capacity

1126
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,359
required to simulate the system would be

1127
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,880
extreme

1128
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
those systems are still weakly emerging

1129
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
in that it still just is ants bumping

1130
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,200
into each other

1131
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,560
now they're developing and that's sort

1132
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,640
of crazy and evolution shapes that and

1133
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,119
everything

1134
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
but still we're talking about a physical

1135
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,560
system not in the

1136
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,920
genre for example of um awareness

1137
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,520
arising spontaneously so how is that

1138
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,119
going to play into

1139
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,000
uh the discussion with active inference

1140
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,119
showing up on the scene

1141
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,280
where will this relate to immersions

1142
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
these are things

1143
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,920
anyone's welcome to chime in on

1144
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,200
also we can tie the idea of emergence

1145
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,320
and the multi-scale systems approach

1146
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,599
to this debate that we often hear about

1147
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
reductionism versus holism so

1148
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,800
reductionism

1149
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
is simply a method of explanation

1150
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,520
where bigger things are made sense of by

1151
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
appeals to the properties of their

1152
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,000
smaller things

1153
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,280
like the bigger wall is um orange

1154
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
because each of the smaller

1155
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,720
pixels is orange or something like that

1156
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,160
there's a variety of reductionist

1157
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,119
explanations

1158
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,520
and it's just one of our hands it's one

1159
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
of our approaches or our wings

1160
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,280
holism is kind of flipping that

1161
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,680
uh schema of reductionism saying

1162
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,960
actually smaller things

1163
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,800
are made sensitive in terms of the

1164
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,079
bigger thing

1165
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
and that um is kind of the opposite

1166
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,000
edge viewpoint and so we have some

1167
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,800
sliding to

1168
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
toward a holistic understanding some

1169
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,240
sliding towards a reductionist

1170
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,839
understanding a lot of

1171
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,119
philosophical work in this area and the

1172
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
thing that we would just want to note

1173
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
here would just be

1174
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
first ask continually how is the free

1175
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
energy principle or active inference

1176
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,359
relating to

1177
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,079
reductionism versus holism because

1178
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,000
sometimes

1179
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it may feel like there is a sort of a

1180
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,040
philosophy of

1181
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
science shift associated with taking on

1182
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,079
the active inference framework

1183
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,760
and so what are the implications of

1184
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,599
taking that seriously where does that

1185
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
put this reductionism versus holism

1186
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,520
is it going to be put into a similar bin

1187
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,280
as nature versus nurture

1188
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,440
as kind of a turn of phrase or a false

1189
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,400
dichotomy

1190
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,599
that was just eventually seen through or

1191
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,960
will there be people who still think

1192
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,640
that that sort of binary phrasing

1193
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,440
whichever side they find themselves on

1194
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
is going to be appropriate and again

1195
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,359
this is where dennis noble's

1196
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,280
work on the bottom up and top down is

1197
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,640
related

1198
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,440
the other work here is girdle escherbach

1199
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
which is the 1979 book

1200
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,800
by douglas hofstetter and here's one of

1201
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,640
the figures from the book where it says

1202
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,760
uh mu mu i don't know how you'd say it

1203
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,000
which is a allegorically at least

1204
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,119
a sort of innovative response or a

1205
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,480
canonical response

1206
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
depending on who you ask of zen koan

1207
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,160
and zen is a topic that's brought up in

1208
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,040
the book

1209
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,400
and the m is written

1210
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,040
of letters that are containing smaller

1211
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,800
letters that say reductionism

1212
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,440
and then the u is made up of letters

1213
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,920
that

1214
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
spell out the other words so it's kind

1215
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
of this multi-scale um

1216
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,960
thought loop really captures the spirit

1217
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,920
of the book well

1218
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
and also it captures at least informally

1219
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,680
through art as often is the case what it

1220
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,240
looks like

1221
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,880
to go beyond the reductionism versus

1222
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,520
holism debate so first if only in a text

1223
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
illustration but then eventually

1224
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,640
how does that relate to a computer

1225
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
screen how about a person interacting

1226
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,760
with a computer screen

1227
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
how about two people interacting with

1228
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
their computer screens

1229
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
all right few more perspectives on

1230
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
systems modeling and action

1231
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,040
how is world modeling related to

1232
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,200
pragmatics and action

1233
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,599
so the questions to ask here is really

1234
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,800
is there a best map

1235
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,720
of the territory uh short answer no

1236
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,760
and this is true for geospatial maps as

1237
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,319
well as

1238
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,319
fields of affordances which we talked

1239
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,880
about in the previous active streams

1240
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
which also often demand to be mapped

1241
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,839
for example skill set mappings or

1242
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,280
concept mappings

1243
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,520
so there's a lot to say about map and

1244
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,800
territory of course

1245
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,119
but for here it's suffices to say that

1246
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,240
the best map

1247
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,200
is defined by the mission by the context

1248
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
by the degree of certainty by all these

1249
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,960
other features and factors related to

1250
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,760
the user

1251
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,319
and the situation so we're talking about

1252
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,520
making maps

1253
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,160
uh of meaning maps for the world we're

1254
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
talking about doing world modeling for

1255
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,160
effective inference and action as we

1256
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,920
were talking about previously

1257
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,800
so here's just one quote from the paper

1258
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,599
to

1259
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,280
motivate you towards the things that you

1260
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,880
might be able to hear them

1261
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,920
expand more on they write the

1262
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
multi-scale free energy principle model

1263
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
allows us to cast the boundaries of

1264
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
cognition as assembled and maintained in

1265
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,160
an informational dynamics

1266
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
across multiple spatial and temporal

1267
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,680
scales

1268
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,760
crucially we shall show that this

1269
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
multi-scale application

1270
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,000
of the fep free energy principle implies

1271
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,280
both ontological

1272
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,640
and methodological pluralism so a few

1273
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,720
thought questions whether this is before

1274
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,640
or after reading the paper

1275
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,200
you could ask is the free energy

1276
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,920
principle

1277
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,480
pluralistic with respect to non free

1278
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,839
energy principle theories

1279
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,960
or frameworks or principles which

1280
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,160
levels or types of theory is the fep

1281
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,640
consistent or discordant with and one

1282
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,160
starting point there would be

1283
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,720
searching for carl fristen's interview

1284
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
in the 2018

1285
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
alias bulletin and it's an interesting

1286
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,640
question to ask about any theory is okay

1287
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,480
well who is this

1288
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
changing the mind of or what is the

1289
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,920
opposite of this theory and

1290
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,560
is it true or does anyone hold the true

1291
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,280
opposite

1292
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
of this theory does anyone hold a 50

1293
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,599
opposite is it 50 by outcome

1294
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,000
or is it fifty percent by axiom in that

1295
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,040
they diverge

1296
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,280
so you can always ask that and i found

1297
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,240
that that was a

1298
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
very um interesting route to go down as

1299
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,440
far as the fep

1300
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,319
another quote from the paper is just

1301
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,119
because it's such a

1302
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,040
direct claim our claim is that

1303
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
which among these which are the situated

1304
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,319
barriers of

1305
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
talking of systems which among these are

1306
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,920
the most relevant will depend on the

1307
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,599
phenomena being studied and the

1308
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,400
explanatory interests of researchers

1309
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,599
and so there's a few notions like

1310
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,280
markov blanket which we talked about

1311
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,960
earlier is that sense in action

1312
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,359
piercing that's related to ecological

1313
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,800
psychological concepts as well

1314
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,920
the markov blankets

1315
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,560
are defined in a few different ways

1316
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,599
they're defined

1317
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,800
by statistical covariations but

1318
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,319
one type of those is going to be causal

1319
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,040
and also another type of those could be

1320
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,400
like a measurement

1321
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,160
and so the kinds of measurements that we

1322
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
make the types of causal relationships

1323
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,680
that are important and then which models

1324
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,640
we apply to them

1325
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,599
is going to depend on uh what is enacted

1326
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,040
by the researchers because they're also

1327
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,160
part of embodied and cultured cognition

1328
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,880
so briefly what are mythological and

1329
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
ontological pluralism so

1330
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,000
methodological pluralism means using a

1331
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,680
variety of methods or ways of doing

1332
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,800
ontological pluralism means having a

1333
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,680
variety

1334
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,720
of ontologies or ways of knowing

1335
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,359
and pluralism is referring to there

1336
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,640
being multiple

1337
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,680
now there are other schools of thought

1338
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,359
that are sort of higher order than

1339
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,800
pluralism as to

1340
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,760
how do you cut through that is it just

1341
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,440
theory anarchy like um

1342
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,040
fair bend suggested where the pluralism

1343
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,200
can just be taken to this extreme

1344
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,440
uh equivalent to almost a novelty search

1345
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,599
in theory space

1346
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,160
or is there going to be some way to cut

1347
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,440
through that and determine

1348
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,400
which of the pluralistic options or

1349
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
possibilities or actualities

1350
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,319
is preferable because ultimately we do

1351
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,079
have to act that's that type 2 type of

1352
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,079
model

1353
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,920
so ask yourself for direct action

1354
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,160
or for more philosophical topics what is

1355
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,440
utilitarianism or pragmatism

1356
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,119
how do such ideas relate to pluralism so

1357
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
it's one thing to say we're scientists

1358
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
and whichever level of analysis

1359
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,720
is most relevant well that's going to

1360
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,319
depend on what we're studying

1361
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,640
and what we're interested in explaining

1362
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,359
but

1363
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,920
should it is that really the best way to

1364
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
approach these systems

1365
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,560
should we really um knowing that we can

1366
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,960
never

1367
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,000
remove for example individual bias

1368
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,839
but still wanting to model systems so

1369
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,359
that we can act effectively

1370
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,040
how are we going to balance just this

1371
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,359
sort of ruthless utilitarianism

1372
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,079
pragmatism whatever ends justify the

1373
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:54,720
means

1374
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,960
um whatever preconceived worldview

1375
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,560
whatever your bayesian prior is just

1376
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,720
stick with that no matter what happens

1377
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,280
how how is that related to cutting

1378
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:03,760
through

1379
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,599
the noise of pluralism

1380
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,960
these are again just questions to raise

1381
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,319
in active inference

1382
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,880
how are ideas related to action and what

1383
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,000
kind of ideas or mental states are there

1384
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
there's a few kind of interesting

1385
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,000
categories that we perceive at least

1386
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,720
experientially various schools of

1387
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,119
thought

1388
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,680
on that but where are we going to fit

1389
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,680
these into the active inference

1390
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
framework are those just different loops

1391
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
in our generative model things like

1392
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,520
emotion

1393
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,960
or desires or dreams or secrets

1394
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,200
where are those going to fit into this

1395
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,079
active inference

1396
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,680
framework how integrated is that going

1397
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,599
to be across

1398
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,480
types of ideas

1399
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,200
and how are our conserved or novel ideas

1400
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,599
respectively meaning orthodoxy or

1401
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,800
heterodoxy

1402
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,960
associated with the expression of

1403
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,800
conserved or novel actions

1404
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
so that is ortho practice or

1405
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,240
heteropraxis

1406
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
and linking that to active inference

1407
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,839
which is kind of

1408
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,160
just framing this two-stroke engine or

1409
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,000
this continual ooda

1410
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
loop a lot of ways to think about it

1411
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,920
it's just framing this continual flow

1412
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,480
between

1413
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,319
action and inference so how are those

1414
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,839
two linked here's another way of asking

1415
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:18,720
it

1416
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,000
and just to conclude with two

1417
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,559
books to study how this has been studied

1418
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,960
from a philosophy of science perspective

1419
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,599
on the right is scientific pluralism uh

1420
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,119
edited by keller longino

1421
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,720
and waters and then on the left is a

1422
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,359
book called studying human behavior

1423
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,200
how scientists investigate aggression

1424
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
and sexuality by helen longneau

1425
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,200
and these books talk about the

1426
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,280
question of pluralism in science and

1427
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,359
different ways that people have

1428
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,240
sort of cut through the massive theories

1429
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,800
or not

1430
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,640
or contributed to it i guess in some

1431
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
cases and there's just a really

1432
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,359
interesting

1433
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,079
body of thought and so it's uh useful to

1434
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:58,720
think

1435
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,119
for people who are in the free energy

1436
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,079
space

1437
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,079
as well as from the outside what are the

1438
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,680
bridges that link

1439
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,440
what's happening with the free energy

1440
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,200
principle and active inference

1441
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,440
to more classical philosophy of science

1442
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,240
questions

1443
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,359
and so hopefully in the first in

1444
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,400
alias paper from 2018 and

1445
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,720
also some other excellent work from the

1446
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,480
last few years

1447
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,000
we'll come to a better understanding of

1448
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,400
that so

1449
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,079
thanks for participating which i guess

1450
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,559
was me and you as the listener

1451
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,280
we will provide a follow-up form to live

1452
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,040
participants

1453
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,839
and we would welcome any feedback

1454
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,720
suggestions

1455
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,240
questions you have and yeah

1456
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,359
stay in communication with us so

1457
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,400
thanks again for listening and

1458
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,839
we hope to either see you at 5.1 or

1459
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,799
a future discussion
