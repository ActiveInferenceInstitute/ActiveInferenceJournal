about

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
everyone's individual experience and

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,039
also as far as video etiquette goes

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,199
please mute if it's noisy in your

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,079
background

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
and remember to raise your hand it's

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
awesome that we have so many

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
participants today

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
and so to hear from everybody let's just

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
make sure to raise hand and all

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
keep um a cue of people who have raised

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,040
their hand

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
so today in act m stream 5.1

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
the roadmap for our discussion over the

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
next hour and a half will be as follows

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
first we'll have a warm-up section where

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
we give a quick intro and check-in

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
then we'll be discussing the paper we'll

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
talk about the goal of the paper

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
we'll talk about the road map or the

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
section headers

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
go through the abstract and then go

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
through all the figures

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
we'll also be able to touch on some

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
background concepts if we have time

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
and address some excellent questions

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
submitted by sasha

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
and other participants and next week on

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
5.2

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
we're going to have further discussion

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
on this same paper

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
so please remember to save and submit

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
any questions

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
that you might have that don't get

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,719
addressed in this first discussion

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
awesome so here we go into the

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,240
introduction

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
section please introduce yourself and

62
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
your location and just say hello to

63
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
everyone in a short introduction

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
and then pass to somebody who you

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
haven't heard introduced themselves yet

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800

i'm i'm a full-time associate professor

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
in cognitive and behavioral sciences at

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
the school of psychology

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
at the unam and also i'm an active

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,040
member of the community robotics lab

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
at the wyom mexico also and well

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
my research focuses on perceptual

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
optimization processes

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
such as sensory acceleration and sensory

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,800
enhancement

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
and also the computational modeling of

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,040
perception

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
cognition and i'm like

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
uh hooked with the predictive processing

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,879
active inference

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
quality coding and energy principles

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,159
since long time ago uh it's like um

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
my passion um and i'm

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
like giving a full time some

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,159
some of my days to the breathing and

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
trying to understand

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,720
um this this particular free energy

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,760
principle

99
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,239
so yeah that's me

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
let's pass to alex

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
hello everybody yeah my name is alex i'm

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,879
from

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,480
moscow russia i'm a researcher in

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
system management school and trying to

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,519
find a way

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
how to join concepts from system

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
engineering

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
and active inference frameworks

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,959
so let's say for sasha

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
hi thank you my name is sasha i'm a

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
neuroscience graduate student at davis

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
and my background in

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
a free energy principle is just reading

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
and

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
enthusiasm for figuring out how to apply

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,000
this to

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
my own work with developmental

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,520
neuroscience

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
and just looking forward to the

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
conversation

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,759
i'm going to pass it to mel

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
hello yep can you hear me awesome

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,639
perfect hi i'm mel andrews i'm

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
in cincinnati ohio right now um

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
i have a background in cognitive science

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
and i've always been fascinated by

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
issues in theoretical biology

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
and switched to philosophy for my phd to

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,759
really focus

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
on um sort of what are called um

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
life-mind continuity theories and in

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
particular i'm focusing on

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,639
the free energy principle as a formal

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,680
articulation of

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
a like-minded movie

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
oh i'm gonna pass this on to

137
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,479
richard thanks uh so my name is

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
richard niemeyer i'm an assistant

139
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
professor of sociology in denver

140
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,720
colorado

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,039
in the united states um my interest is

142
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,560
mainly in understanding how we can

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
integrate

144
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
neuroscience cognitive psychology and

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
sociology into more integrated framework

146
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,240
um most of psychological or sorry

147
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
sociological and criminal chronological

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
theories drawing on a lot of behaviorism

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
from the 70s and 80s

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
it's kind of its theory of mind and how

151
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
the mind society

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
relates to one another so i'm trying to

153
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
figure out more up-to-date ways to

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
integrate mind-body and society

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
most of the mathematics that i'm

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
familiar with in terms of kind of how to

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
do that is a lot of fractal geometry

158
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
graph theory dynamical systems theory

159
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
which is really fascinating but i've

160
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
been really interested in kind of the

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
free energy principle

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
it seems to do a much more kind of

163
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
intuitive

164
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
fluid dynamic way of integrating

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
different levels of analysis

166
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
and integrating specifically cognitive

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
emotion action things like that which

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
are really critical when you get into

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,199
kind of that social level of reality so

170
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
i've tried my best to work my way

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,280
through a lot of papers by myself and

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
it's been a struggle so

173
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
to find a community who's kind of doing

174
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
this together and can kind of listen to

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
other people talk about these ideas

176
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
is is really really helpful so i really

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
appreciate the opportunity to be here

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
i'm gonna pass it on to muddy

179
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
oh classic it was on me hi guys my name

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
is muddy

181
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,919
so i was a i was a phd student with carl

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,960
briston

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
graduating back in 2016 but i also was a

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
medical student on the md phd pathway

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
so my interest was in applying

186
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,960
free energy principle to study

187
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
stroke dynamics non-invasively using

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,240
neuro imaging

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
i since left the the medical world i

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,319
practiced medicine about

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
a week and then uh went into the tech

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,599
world i worked for

193
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
google deep mind and started the medical

194
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,520
tech company which was

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
acquired by the company i currently work

196
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
for now versus where i'm i'm the

197
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
director of ai and we're really

198
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
interested in spatial web technologies

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,960
spatial web protocols and building

200
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,599
provenance

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
ais that are not only explainable but

202
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
action-based and adaptable so that's

203
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
kind of like

204
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,879
that and um i will pass it on to

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
professor cliffinger who is quietly set

206
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
there

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
thank you honey uh hi everybody my name

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
is john clevenger

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,479
um i am now well i'm in northern new

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,039
hampshire

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
jefferson new hampshire farm but

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
actually i'm generally out of cambridge

213
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
mass

214
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
and um with the mit media lab the city

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
science group and i've been at mit in

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
the human dynamics group for a number of

217
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
years

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,559
um my interest actually uh i'm

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,200
a full convert recent convert to pristin

220
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,000
la

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,839
the the first and cult as they were but

222
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
uh

223
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
continued reading the papers that are

224
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
coming out the productivity of this

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
and working uh with maxwell and casper

226
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
about how to apply this to

227
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
uh modeling um modeling new concept of

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,240
firm new

229
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
concept the market new concept of

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
community um

231
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
so we have some projects that we're

232
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,399
focusing on that and actually

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,440
collaborating with

234
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
muddy on that as well

235
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
cool let's go to shannon

236
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
hi i'm shannon crooks i'm in south

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
dakota currently but i'm usually based

238
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
at the university of california in

239
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,880
merced

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
um and i'm in a sensory motor

241
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
neuroscience lab

242
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
i investigate the neural dynamics of

243
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
music cognition

244
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,360
and specifically how we process rhythm

245
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
and then interested in how

246
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
predictive processing approaches can

247
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
help us understand

248
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
how we perceive rhythm and music i'm

249
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
also interested in

250
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,120
how groups of people interact when

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
they're experiencing music when they're

252
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
playing it

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,880
or listening to it and in larger

254
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
dynamics of crowds

255
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,040
i'm excited for today's discussion um

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
specifically

257
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
for how you know a crowd could have a

258
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
different markov blanket

259
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
based on its interactions throughout

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
maybe a musical performance or a

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
sporting event

262
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
cool i think we have maxwell

263
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
muted maxwell sorry about that

264
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
hey i'm maxwell ramstead i'm a

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,839
postdoctoral fellow

266
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
at mcgill university and i'm one of the

267
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
main architects of the multiscale active

268
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,440
inference formulation

269
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
that we'll be discussing today and the

270
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
first author on this paper

271
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
multi-scale integration beyond

272
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
externalism and

273
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
beyond internalism and externalism and

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,560
i will pass it off to alex kiefer

275
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
uh hi everyone i'm alex um as nestle

276
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
just said um

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
i'm coming from a philosophy and

278
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
cognitive science background um

279
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
i got my phd at the cuny graduate center

280
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:52,959
um

281
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,760
currently um at monash university in

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
melbourne but not actually there because

283
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
of the pandemic so

284
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
i'm in the new york city area um and i'm

285
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
interested in

286
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
uh i'm coming from sort of a traditional

287
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
philosophy of my perspective i

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
increasingly got into like connectionism

289
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
machine learning

290
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
modeling eventually the fep and i'm

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
interested in how this stuff ties into

292
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,920
fairly traditional representationalism

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
on the one hand and sort of physics on

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
the other and how these come together

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
so that's my angle and this and i'm

296
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
really excited to talk about this paper

297
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
cool i think stephen and then if daniela

298
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
jumps back in we'll go to her but

299
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,000
stephen i think you're the last one here

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,560
oh okay hi i'm stephen civit i'm in

301
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,519
toronto

302
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
and i do community development projects

303
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
using theater and immersive

304
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
participatory approaches and

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
ended up developing a process called

306
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
social drama topography

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
in south africa in 2006 and trying to

308
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
scale that process

309
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
in different ways has looked at

310
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
how embodied cognition fits into this

311
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,399
kind of

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
process of engaging communities to make

313
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
embodied maps together around issues and

314
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
that's kind of translated over time into

315
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
other sort of immersive practices and

316
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
i was looking at embodied cognition over

317
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,360
a few years and i kept

318
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
finally seeing this work with carl frist

319
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
and i thought oh my goodness i've

320
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,160
already

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
gone so far down all these avenues and

322
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,399
i've seen this other thing and then

323
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
suddenly i found a page which

324
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
spoke to how many citations he had and i

325
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
thought wait a sec and i suddenly

326
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,720
saw that his work was actually bringing

327
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
all these different threads

328
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
together into this unified framework so

329
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,639
yeah i'm really excited by that awesome

330
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,120
well

331
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
thanks so much everyone for coming out

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
to participate

333
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
um it's really a spread of countries and

334
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
levels of experience and fields of

335
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
expertise so it's about bringing it all

336
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
together and coming together around

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
these topics

338
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
so just as a warm up and to hear from

339
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
everyone who would like to speak by

340
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,200
raising their hand

341
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
let's just start with asking what drew

342
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,240
you

343
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
to this paper or topic today

344
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
so all star and while other people are

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
raising their hand and i described this

346
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
a little bit in the 5.0

347
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
video but i think the idea of

348
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
integrating multi-scale systems

349
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
is really um interesting and there's so

350
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
many ways to go about it

351
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,160
and it's almost undeniable that we're

352
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,519
living in multi-scale systems but the

353
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,079
question is

354
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
what now and so i'm always interested to

355
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,279
hear about

356
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
systems for thinking about what now and

357
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
also for different people's perspective

358
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,279
great muddy and anyone else can raise

359
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
their hands

360
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,920
muted though with a video off it's the

361
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
fine line between

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
muting the background noise and being

363
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
ready so i understand but go ahead muddy

364
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,240
my apologies yeah i think um nested

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
systems are

366
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,720
an incredibly important way to to view

367
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
real dynamical systems that we see all

368
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
the time in the spatial web so

369
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
we constantly have streams of data

370
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
coming from iot

371
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,920
and then we're kind of met with the

372
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
scalability challenge of how do we

373
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
actually model a system

374
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
accurately to represent the dynamics

375
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
that we that we wish without

376
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
getting bogged down in this sort of

377
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
field of complexity so by abstracting

378
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,839
away

379
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,560
these these layers into really really

380
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
meaningful nested

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
heterarchies is is really really key in

382
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
being able to practically

383
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,720
deploy some of these you know novel

384
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
learning paradigms in real world spaces

385
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,480
so i think without this sort of

386
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,240
quote-unquote dimensionality reduction

387
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
i mean that in more of a philosophical

388
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
sense than a mathematical sense

389
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,480
we're going to struggle to apply ai at

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
scale so that's why i'm

391
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,240
i'm particularly interested in the work

392
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
that maxwell and the free energy

393
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
principle group is doing

394
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,160
cool let's hear from maxwell then sasha

395
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
and then i also see other people but

396
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,920
just those two next

397
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
maxwell also muted

398
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
sasha do you want to go first i don't i

399
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
don't have to go next necessarily

400
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
sure i'll uh briefly say a bit

401
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,199
um i was drawn to this paper because

402
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
as a neuroscientist i think a lot about

403
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,560
multi-scale

404
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
um levels and

405
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
to decide at which level a system should

406
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,519
be studied because

407
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
even though um we're studying something

408
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
at a molecular level or even in a

409
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
different species

410
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,800
we ultimately want to make claims about

411
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,839
larger cognitive processes and how to do

412
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
that without abstracting away

413
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,639
really important aspects of the system

414
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,399
at the scale that you're studying it

415
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,680
it's a huge question

416
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,440
so um i really like thinking about these

417
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,320
markov blankets at different levels and

418
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
where to draw the line

419
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
cool maxwell then richard then alex k

420
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
i think my remarks are gonna echo a lot

421
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
of what's been said

422
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
um i got into the free energy principle

423
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
stuff originally

424
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
uh because i was looking for a theory

425
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,279
that could

426
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
address dynamics at and across

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
multiple different uh well the way i

428
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
used to see it is ontological levels

429
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
uh in working with the free energy

430
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,199
principle i've come to reject the

431
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
traditional metaphysics of uh

432
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
of ontological levels uh in favor of

433
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,199
uh you know this view that there are big

434
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,360
things and there are small things

435
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,000
and uh big things are made up by small

436
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
things and big things tend to be slow

437
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
and small things tend to be fast and

438
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
what you actually have is like this

439
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
nested series of systems that are made

440
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
up of increasingly big things

441
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
um and yeah back when i was

442
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
starting up my phd in 2015 uh there

443
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,600
wasn't

444
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,519
any theory that i could see that was

445
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,120
really able to

446
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
not only define dynamics at each of

447
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
these different levels but propose a way

448
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
a mechanism by which they were all

449
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,880
integrated

450
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
and this is what i found uh via the free

451
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,520
energy principle so i

452
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,799
i sort of made it my thing uh from 2016

453
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,280
to

454
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,400
now actually to explore the multi-scale

455
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,119
uh implications of this framework

456
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,679
awesome

457
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
richard then alex k yeah i think um

458
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,079
one thing that i've been really drawn to

459
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
the last couple of years is the

460
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,640
mechanistic

461
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,280
philosophical perspective of of carl

462
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
craver and lindsey darden

463
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,520
they give you this really nice i think

464
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
tool set on how to talk about

465
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
decomposing mechanisms levels of

466
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,039
mechanisms

467
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,320
which is very intuitive and i think

468
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
works well with with sociology

469
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
and biology which has this very clear

470
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
conceptual

471
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
way to move up and down quote unquote

472
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
levels of reality

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
but the thing that's i think always been

474
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
missing is how do i take that conceptual

475
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,919
language

476
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
and match it with an empirical framework

477
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
that allows me to

478
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
um model those levels of reality in a

479
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
way without losing any of the subtleties

480
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,360
and

481
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
any of the the conceptual apparatus that

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,679
is so critical to

483
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,200
talking about those those different

484
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,280
frameworks and the more and more i get

485
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
into the free energy principle it seems

486
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
like it can give you that empirical

487
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,120
language

488
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
that has a very nice natural transition

489
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,280
into that conceptual language i'm so

490
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,160
used to

491
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
that gives you all of the stuff you're

492
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,919
trying to talk about conceptually but

493
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,320
then

494
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
also gives you these empirical tools

495
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
that allows you to go above that and

496
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
talk about the organization of the

497
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
mechanism

498
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
in a very nice precise empirical

499
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
language um that's just impossible to do

500
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
i think with a lot of existing methods

501
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,919
in the fields that i'm used to

502
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,480
cool let's do alex k and steven and then

503
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
i'm gonna go to the second question

504
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
um so i i just recently sort of got

505
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,360
into this whole multi-scale picture um

506
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,640
associated with the fpp

507
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
and um i guess my interest in this is

508
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
um it seems to me like like i'm i'm

509
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
nearly 100 convinced that this is a

510
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,280
really good description of reality at

511
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,480
multiple scales but

512
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,440
i'm not completely convinced that this

513
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
has the radical kind of philosophical

514
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
implications that

515
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
that some people think it does i mean

516
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
this paper actually strikes kind of a

517
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
nice middle ground but

518
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
um i guess to put it briefly like i view

519
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,480
this as

520
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
we've got nested multiple systems each

521
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,080
of which

522
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
possibly has a physical as well as a

523
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
cognitive description and maybe the

524
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,760
bound

525
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,360
the bounds of cognition within that

526
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
hierarchy are maybe

527
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
less strict than may have been thought

528
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
like i'm happy describing cognition

529
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
or ascribing cognition to systems at

530
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
various levels within this hierarchy but

531
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
but i don't see that it's so hard to pin

532
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,160
uh

533
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
the cognitive properties of one

534
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
particular system um

535
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
onto a particular physical system so i'm

536
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
not i'm not sure

537
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
anyway i hope that that gets we can get

538
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
through some of that

539
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,880
also i'm not sure which system i am in

540
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,600
this hierarchy of embedded systems that

541
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
you know my brain involved many systems

542
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
in itself and that's

543
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
self-embedded in larger systems so i'm

544
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
trying to figure out

545
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
which type of system within that

546
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
hierarchy an individual person might

547
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,880
be identified with cool stephen and then

548
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
we're going to go to the next question

549
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
to muddy and mel or anyone else who

550
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,720
raises their hand

551
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,640
yeah i'm very interested in how this

552
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
gives a kind of action orientated

553
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
miso level approach which is really

554
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,559
useful

555
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,000
because when i'm working with say a

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
community trying to understand

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
how to connect to the individual to the

558
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,720
group

559
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
to the team to the organization or maybe

560
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,480
influencing change at the municipality

561
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,280
or

562
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
broader social levels there's this real

563
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
problem with bridging scale

564
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,080
um and it ends up getting caught up in

565
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
all this languaging that

566
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
whichever field has been you know the

567
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,480
psychological perspective or this

568
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
perspective on that perspective

569
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,640
so this gives a kind of seems like a

570
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
very neutral

571
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
clean um way of understanding

572
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
how people make sense of different

573
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
levels

574
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
and that's really valuable i think

575
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,720
that's been missing from

576
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
community psychology is really actually

577
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,400
psychology itself suffering from that

578
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
because it's kind of stuck on this

579
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
level of um perspective or

580
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,919
interpretation so this gives a way to

581
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,679
actually go into the sub-paragraph so

582
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,400
for me

583
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,919
getting into all of this has actually

584
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,520
opened up all this sub personal

585
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,799
neuroscience site

586
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,240
which i actually haven't really got into

587
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
before so it's kind of interesting

588
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
nice thanks for all these responses

589
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
also raised her hand yes so next on the

590
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,960
stack is muddy and then mel and feel

591
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,320
free to answer either

592
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
the first question or the second

593
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
question about what a multi-scale system

594
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,360
you work with is so muddy first

595
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
um great so they actually kind of uh

596
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
fall into each other so one of the

597
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,640
things that i wanted to mention was

598
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
um the practical challenges of

599
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,840
implementing

600
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
um inference in an industry right which

601
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
we kind of do it in a black box but i

602
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
think it was sasha who mentioned that

603
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
or alex who mentioned he had an interest

604
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
in this as well

605
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
um and what we find is that the the

606
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,280
practical correlates uh

607
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
in terms of hardware and chip design

608
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
that we need to to deploy this stuff

609
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
in reality is is difficult

610
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
based on the data sets that we collect

611
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,559
so one of the systems that uh

612
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,840
we're currently modeling right now is

613
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
warehouse pick and pack working for for

614
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,520
amazon

615
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,559
and understanding that

616
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,120
the the systems that drive why people

617
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
pick certain

618
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
boxes from certain shelves for example

619
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
is like a multi-nested

620
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
system of everything from how valuable

621
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,039
an item is to how tired the pick and

622
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,960
pack worker is even down to the function

623
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,520
of

624
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
how tall they are versus how high on the

625
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,520
shelf the particular item on the waiting

626
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,559
list is

627
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,960
so understanding how to pick that apart

628
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,159
and um

629
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,320
deliver value essentially in industry

630
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
eventually so yes we have this wonderful

631
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
way of viewing the world

632
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
but we also have a practical set of

633
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,360
tools which are a wonderful way of

634
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
modeling the world as well

635
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,600
and so having this nested system i think

636
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,799
is really really important

637
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
in terms of biting into the problem of

638
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
practical deployment of these

639
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
these types of models at scale in order

640
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
to deliver value now i don't just mean

641
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
business value i mean

642
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
you know inside value as well so those

643
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
are just a couple of comments that i

644
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
wanted to to introduce into the

645
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
discussion as well

646
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
so thanks for that mel and then anyone

647
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,559
else can raise their hand

648
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,280
hi um i was drawn to this topic because

649
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,559
um i've been trying to

650
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
convince maxwell for a long time that

651
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
the fep

652
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
is just um that basically we should

653
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
we should be taking as instrumental as

654
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
an approach to this

655
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,400
as as we possibly can this is like the

656
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
bare bones uh

657
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
it's it's just a model it doesn't

658
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
constitute knowledge of the world it

659
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,880
doesn't

660
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
constitute falsifiable claims it doesn't

661
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,039
constitute

662
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
uh et cetera et cetera et cetera it's

663
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
just a model and we just

664
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,960
we use it to get at things in the world

665
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
and and and that's it

666
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,559
um and this paper's uh interesting to me

667
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,559
because

668
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,799
in it maxwell is the one pushing the

669
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,559
instrumentalist line that that i don't

670
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,360
want to

671
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,120
bite uh namely that's a

672
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,559
that there's nothing more to

673
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,679
the boundaries of systems

674
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,080
than is it useful to model it that way

675
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,880
right is it

676
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
is it can it can it be usefully modeled

677
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
as the battery is here

678
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,400
for me i'm i'm very um

679
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
i'm very willing to privilege the

680
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,720
organism

681
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,240
as a privileged scale

682
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,159
or level or unit of analysis and i'm

683
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,240
very willing to privilege the brain

684
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
as well so in that order

685
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
interesting fighting words mel um

686
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
shannon and then anyone else can raise

687
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,159
their hand too

688
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
i i feel partial to those those last

689
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,360
words from mel

690
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,200
on privileging the organism or the brain

691
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
um but that could be just because i

692
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,679
i study the brain i want to know the the

693
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,960
neural mechanisms

694
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
that are giving us

695
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
any of our perceptions or engagement

696
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
with the world

697
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,679
um but i think i was drawn to this topic

698
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
because um i was drawn through

699
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
predictive processing literature and

700
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
like um andy clark's work and then

701
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
eventually on here to the free energy

702
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,000
principle

703
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,279
um but a lot of what was written

704
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,679
and like is now has these great

705
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,799
mathematical models

706
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,039
um that we've touched on before like an

707
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,640
ability to translate

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
um maybe some sort of phenomenological

709
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,679
experience

710
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
into a formal model um it meshed really

711
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,200
well

712
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,120
with my studies in music and what

713
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,559
like teachers of music will instill upon

714
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,279
you in that

715
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,640
you're basically

716
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
through your musical experience you're

717
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
modeling something about the human

718
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,720
experience

719
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
um so you're choreographing aspects of

720
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,960
tension

721
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
and release which sounds a little bit

722
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,320
like

723
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,159
balancing um predictions and

724
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
prediction errors um and you're trying

725
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
to maintain a certain boundary within a

726
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,520
musical piece

727
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,159
of the emotion that you are experiencing

728
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,760
or that you want your

729
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
audience to experience and this sounds a

730
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,120
lot like a boundary on a certain

731
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,919
phenotype

732
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
of experience um and just sort of this

733
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
like superficial matching of the

734
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,559
language of musical expression and then

735
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,320
this empirical

736
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,760
um like statistical language is

737
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
sort of what drew me in and i suppose

738
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
that answers the multi-scale system i

739
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
work with um

740
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,919
music and musicians and people cool

741
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
very interesting we'll go to richard and

742
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
then the third question

743
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
yeah kind of building a little bit on on

744
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,760
mel's point

745
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
in terms of the multi-scale system so

746
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,039
obviously as a sociologist i deal with

747
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
groups i deal with society

748
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
and you know i can take an individual

749
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,919
and i can take two individuals now i

750
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,960
have a dyad

751
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
i have another one i have a triad i can

752
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
model that as a network

753
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
i can collapse the network down and

754
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,679
model it as a dynamical system

755
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,679
and now i can talk about organizations i

756
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,360
have multiple dynamical systems talk

757
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
about them interacting

758
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,399
now i have a network of coupled

759
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,240
oscillators i can go in i can use

760
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,760
fractal geometry to talk about how

761
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
properties are scaling up and down

762
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,399
from the dyad the triad all the way up

763
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:40,880
to that

764
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,799
network of coupled oscillators and at

765
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,640
the end of the day i i'm never really

766
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,159
confused about whether or not i'm

767
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
really talking about networks or am i

768
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
really talking about dynamical systems

769
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,919
they're all just models that allow me to

770
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,600
capture the phenomenon that i do believe

771
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
is real i do believe society exists

772
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
if you ever want to get into a very

773
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,720
strange conversation go to a conference

774
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
of sociologists arguing about whether or

775
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
not the united states is real

776
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,679
and my comeback is always don't pay your

777
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,120
taxes on april 15th

778
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
and you'll figure out very quickly if

779
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
the united states is is real or not

780
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
and so i think you know a lot of these

781
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,480
philosophical questions are always

782
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
fascinating

783
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
especially at three o'clock in the

784
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,559
morning in a pub when you've had too

785
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,000
many to drink

786
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
but i think ultimately in the day you

787
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,919
know there is a concrete reality

788
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,919
the question is what empirical model

789
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
just allows you to model it

790
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
as true to the theory or the concepts

791
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
that you're that you're dealing with

792
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,679
um without losing information you know

793
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,440
unnecessarily so i think

794
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
you know again i think any empirical

795
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,880
model that allows me to do that

796
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
is fascinating um but at the end of the

797
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
day i do believe you know the humans

798
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
that i'm ultimately talking about

799
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
are concrete and are are real

800
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,520
nice i'm gonna introduce the third

801
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,200
question we'll go to buddy

802
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
first here and anyone else can raise

803
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
their hand the third question is

804
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,039
why does our philosophy of systems

805
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
matter

806
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
um that is quite bizarrely scary and

807
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,000
psychic because that's what the point i

808
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
was going to make just to just to

809
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,480
piggyback on on richard's comments just

810
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,279
there

811
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,320
which is um i remember these discussions

812
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,919
these really really lively discussions

813
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,880
about you know how

814
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,080
representative is this model of reality

815
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,240
and i remember at some point just

816
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,080
thinking well how useful is this a

817
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
question to ask

818
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
you know at some point is

819
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,720
is the model just a tool a means to an

820
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,679
end and

821
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,320
do we employ bounds on what we expect

822
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,600
from these models in terms of their

823
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,399
utility

824
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,880
and if these models and their outputs

825
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
satisfy these bounds

826
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,760
great you know i i sometimes i

827
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
i see some of the the discourse around

828
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,159
free energy principles and and what it

829
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,000
means philosophically

830
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,279
and we lose what it gives us in terms of

831
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,399
explainability

832
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,440
and an actual measurable dynamics so i

833
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,559
actually

834
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,360
fall probably like very far on the side

835
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,000
of

836
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
i don't think our philosophy of systems

837
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,000
matter at all i think our explainability

838
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,240
of

839
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
empirically measured data is by far the

840
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,399
most important thing

841
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,120
and trying to explain systems where our

842
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,039
data sets are incredibly sparse

843
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,880
so for example the entire hierarchical

844
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,200
organization of the brain from cell to

845
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
effective connectivity

846
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,559
i think is um sometimes missing the

847
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,480
point of just how valuable

848
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
these novel uh schemes can be so that

849
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
that's kind of what i wanted to touch on

850
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
that

851
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,080
nice stephen and then anyone else before

852
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,640
we close out this question

853
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,200
yeah i think that that empirical pieces

854
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
and practicality or

855
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,039
practice application is really a good

856
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,919
point

857
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,760
one thing that has caught me out though

858
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,520
and i've realized is

859
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,559
is that perspectivism is very much

860
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,840
part of systems generally and it's also

861
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
part of psychology like we take a

862
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,279
perspective on stuff

863
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,880
and there's this assumption that

864
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
everything well what's your perspective

865
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,480
that word just gets used all the time

866
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
and it's like but the thing is that the

867
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,600
free energy principle gives you a way

868
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
and then they say okay and now we're

869
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
going to do stuff that's performative or

870
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,399
arts based

871
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,840
and it's a bit like we don't know what

872
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
to do with that so we just call it

873
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,240
another field

874
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
right and then they do that but the the

875
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,679
the the active inference gives you

876
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,880
realize well there's

877
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
there's a way that you can abductively

878
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,919
or from

879
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,840
within be creating meaning

880
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,039
um during experience and it's um

881
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,720
i suppose a bit like that person picking

882
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,440
stuff from the shelves and they're not

883
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
sitting there as they do it having a

884
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,880
perspective like they may

885
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
take a perspective if you give them a

886
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
qualitative survey later which is what

887
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,200
nearly all social science does so you

888
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
take us perspective a first-person

889
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,640
perspective on your experience but the

890
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,080
experience wasn't first-person

891
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,039
perspective the

892
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,320
experience was just the experience

893
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,880
so this gives a way for that to all be

894
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
kind of um

895
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,919
unified in some way cool let's go to

896
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,919
alex and then richard then close out

897
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,640
this check-in

898
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,919
um just really briefly i mean i think i

899
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,440
think it matters philosophy systems

900
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,880
matters because

901
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
i think the philosophy well i guess i'm

902
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,159
sort of a holist

903
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,679
in a way at least in terms of

904
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
explanation so i think it matters

905
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,080
because

906
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,559
um the philosophy of every little bit

907
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,360
matters

908
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,559
uh because it connects to everything

909
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,720
else but also this is sort of a question

910
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,039
that

911
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,200
can be applied at multiple scales so so

912
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,559
it could potentially matter a lot

913
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,679
i guess i mean that doesn't really

914
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,039
answer the question of why philosophy

915
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,919
matters ever

916
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,080
but i think it's because it's part of a

917
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,519
big theoretical framework

918
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,960
i'm sort of acquiring about this stuff

919
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
so these questions about realism

920
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,120
and instrumentalism don't land all that

921
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,159
well with me because

922
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,360
i mean for example i think the fep if it

923
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
ends up being part of our best overall

924
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,799
sort of account of things

925
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,440
then i think it's confirmed or

926
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,559
disconfirmed

927
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
by proxy whenever anything any

928
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,760
observation is

929
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,799
is recorded right so um

930
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,159
unless you want to say that it doesn't

931
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,600
have any inferential connections to

932
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
anything else in which case

933
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
it's really weird i don't know why we're

934
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,480
talking about it um

935
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
anyway that's enough for me perfect

936
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
richard and mel to close out the section

937
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,360
thanks

938
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
yeah i think in many ways and this is

939
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,799
probably just maybe disciplinary

940
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,960
specific but the philosophy of systems

941
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
and the philosophy of

942
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,399
what we do in science i think is

943
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,760
incredibly important in the social

944
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
sciences because

945
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,240
so much so much of our concept so much

946
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,880
of our

947
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,360
our theory that that we deal with now is

948
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,279
is deeply indebted to

949
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,240
dewey and uh conned and you know hegel

950
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
and these these

951
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,960
uh philosophical arguments about the

952
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,240
relationship between mind body and

953
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,200
society

954
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
what is a thing what are the boundaries

955
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,399
of things and

956
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,919
these things have been baked into our

957
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,760
theories and many times we don't

958
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,360
recognize that they're there and they're

959
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
they're deeply affecting concepts and

960
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
how things are operationalized and what

961
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,519
we consider to be a truth value or not

962
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,000
and to go in and unpack those theories

963
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
find those philosophical arguments

964
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,240
and then interrogate them from these

965
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
kind of emerging perspectives and say

966
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,119
you know was whitehead onto something

967
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,719
about kind of you know

968
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
uh the extension of reality as an

969
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,599
ontological category or was he not

970
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
and if he wasn't and this new principle

971
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,760
can deal with a lot of those ideas

972
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,239
in ways that were significantly shaped

973
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,599
uh sociology

974
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,119
then great we have something to kind of

975
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
move on to um so i think that

976
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,879
philosophy is always this thing as much

977
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,719
as i try and get rid of it it's always

978
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,239
coming in the back door some

979
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,399
somehow some way and i think just being

980
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,000
sensitive to it being comfortable

981
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
dealing with it and interrogating it

982
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,918
from these new perspectives

983
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,119
i think is always going to be something

984
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,560
that's very important because it's

985
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
always there in the background

986
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,800
somewhere if you dig deep enough thanks

987
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
well said and then

988
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,480
mel and then we'll let maxwell have a

989
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,199
last stop as well

990
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,359
in my mind philosophy doesn't answer

991
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,359
questions it raises questions

992
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,640
um and the empirical sciences attempt

993
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,760
to answer those questions

994
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,640
but you need philosophy but don't chew

995
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
on the computer jesus christ

996
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,960
you sorry you need philosophy to both

997
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
raise those questions

998
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,960
and then to uh to tell you

999
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,599
how those questions have been

1000
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,440
potentially answered

1001
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,200
by the empirical results so

1002
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
um there is no such

1003
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,520
thing as as kind of science operating in

1004
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,280
a in a vacuum without philosophy of

1005
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
science that's my opinion

1006
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,000
uh that that there's this necessary

1007
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,520
dialectic between the philosophy of

1008
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
science and science itself

1009
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,040
um going on

1010
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
cool agreed maxwell and then professor

1011
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
clippenger if you'd like

1012
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880
um well so i think that there's a

1013
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
there's a methodological component to

1014
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,079
this as well

1015
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,640
i i want to echo what what everyone said

1016
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
earlier

1017
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,320
uh you know if if we're gonna study uh

1018
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,000
multi-scale systems it's good to get our

1019
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
ontology straight

1020
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
and you know the fact that nature seems

1021
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
to have this multi-scale

1022
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
structure suggests that our theoretical

1023
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,320
accounts of nature should also reflect

1024
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,520
its uh multi-scale structure

1025
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,720
but i think from a more pragmatic point

1026
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,760
of view

1027
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
um i i like to think that a lot of the

1028
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,280
uh kind of single discipline uh topics

1029
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,160
have

1030
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,640
uh been covered in in a very significant

1031
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
way

1032
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
but that there isn't there isn't the

1033
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,160
same kind of

1034
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,839
um you know established work

1035
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,839
connecting different methodologies that

1036
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,200
operate uh

1037
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,520
at different scales so i think that you

1038
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
know the

1039
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
getting this systems take right not only

1040
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,839
has

1041
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,320
theoretical implications but also has

1042
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
practical implications

1043
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,599
uh for the way that we conduct uh

1044
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
research namely

1045
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,040
that we should aim to form uh

1046
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,000
multi-disciplinary groups

1047
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,480
that address questions of interest from

1048
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,280
several different

1049
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,320
angles simultaneously so and this is

1050
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
echoed in the paper

1051
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,240
that we'll be discussing today where

1052
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,079
what we're essentially trying to do is

1053
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,720
advance

1054
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,240
uh on the one hand a pluralistic

1055
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,599
ontology a multi-scale uh ontology and

1056
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,480
on the other hand

1057
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,040
uh a a uh methodological pluralism

1058
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
uh where several different uh sets of

1059
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,359
methodologies can come and interact

1060
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,960
together

1061
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,359
nice professor cliffinger or anything

1062
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,720
else there

1063
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
you're muted but yes um okay i have to

1064
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
apologize because i have to leave early

1065
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
but this is a great discussion a great

1066
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
beginning i'd have to

1067
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,720
i just want to throw my hat in this i

1068
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
i'm sort of in in

1069
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
a muddy's camp uh and looking at

1070
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
explanatory power

1071
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,359
um and i think a lot of that is there i

1072
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,400
i'm so sort of

1073
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,119
uh ditto with with what maxwell is

1074
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,200
saying in terms of providing an

1075
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,880
integrated framework

1076
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,000
uh i i of course as a philosophical the

1077
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
philosophy has a place in it but i think

1078
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,520
we're there there were so many

1079
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,079
losses embedded in historical situations

1080
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,920
that are really not

1081
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
that i think we're at another level of

1082
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,839
understanding that

1083
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,680
it's what becomes really important is

1084
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,400
being able to start to test these things

1085
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
and be able to rigorously test them and

1086
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,000
because there are a lot of very

1087
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,880
powerful claims that are being made that

1088
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
if they're true they're quite

1089
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,599
transformative but they

1090
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,880
they need to be tested awesome thank you

1091
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920
everyone for this very exciting check-in

1092
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,359
and i'll just add one

1093
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
comment on why the philosophy of systems

1094
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
matter and it's examples that are

1095
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,440
brought up

1096
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
by um helen longino in her book studying

1097
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,280
human behavior

1098
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
uh which level of analysis which

1099
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,960
discipline we default to

1100
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
molecular neuroscience or environmental

1101
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,560
studies if we

1102
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
default to a higher level of

1103
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,960
organization or lower level to look for

1104
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
our explanations philosophically

1105
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,960
it's going to directly translate to what

1106
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,800
kinds of interventions we think

1107
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
are going to be possible in the system

1108
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,800
and so if the story about

1109
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,640
for example aggression and sexuality

1110
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
which is what professor longinus studies

1111
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
in that book

1112
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,599
if the story is it comes from jeans well

1113
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,880
then you're going to be

1114
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
less likely to undertake affordances

1115
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
related to the environment

1116
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,400
if the story is um about the environment

1117
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,920
you're going to be unlikely to take

1118
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,440
affordances related to molecular

1119
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
interventions

1120
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
so even before we say what it actually

1121
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,480
is and that's of course a complex

1122
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,520
question or what

1123
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,599
is the best thing for the system i i

1124
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,960
would fall on the side

1125
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
that it really does matter in the

1126
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
background and sometimes it's just the

1127
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,760
water we swim in

1128
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,680
how we think about these multi-level

1129
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
systems

1130
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,839
so let's just like for a three second

1131
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,640
aside

1132
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,040
i i will happily admit that i'm a

1133
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,640
staunch empiricist

1134
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,880
somebody who worked in industry

1135
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
basically the moment i could

1136
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,680
and so i you know what i've i'm just

1137
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,119
conceding a little bit that actually

1138
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,400
you're right without the philosophy of

1139
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
science we don't introduce

1140
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
novel ideas that are worth testing in

1141
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
the first place right and

1142
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
that discourse is what leads to the

1143
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
models that allow me to try to issue

1144
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,240
value from that

1145
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,800
quote-unquote value from that so i am

1146
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
backing down just a little bit from my

1147
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
empiricism after this discussion

1148
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,319
so i just wanted to say that yeah nice

1149
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,119
um

1150
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,440
a live conversion story you heard it

1151
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,160
here first

1152
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,440
but even pragmatism is defined within a

1153
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,160
use

1154
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,720
view so it's like all models are wrong

1155
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,000
some are useful and then the

1156
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
second part of that sentence might be

1157
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,280
useful for whom or under

1158
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,880
what conception there's no model that's

1159
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
just useful outside of a

1160
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,000
value set so pragmatics isn't just like

1161
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
let's just do the most useful thing

1162
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
there's not just one useful thing

1163
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,160
so after that extremely interesting

1164
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,800
check-in let's get to what the paper is

1165
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,359
about

1166
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,680
and what the goals of the paper are so

1167
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,400
the paper

1168
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,960
is multi-scale integration beyond

1169
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,720
internalism and externalism

1170
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
by ramstead kirchoff constant and

1171
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,640
fristen from 2019

1172
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,000
and what the paper writes their goal as

1173
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,280
is here we focus on making sorry someone

1174
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,160
needs to mute um

1175
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,960
i'm going to mute that person here we

1176
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,119
focus on making explicit a description

1177
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,119
of the boundaries of cognitive systems

1178
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
that we think follow from taking

1179
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,400
seriously the inactive

1180
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,240
embodied and extended nature of

1181
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
cognition this is the idea

1182
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,319
that the boundaries of cognitive systems

1183
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,079
are nested and multiple

1184
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,920
and that with respect to its study

1185
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
cognition has no fixed or

1186
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
essential boundaries and so it's all

1187
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
about this taking it seriously with a

1188
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,000
multi-scale integration

1189
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
so how are we going to take the

1190
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,520
multi-scale integration

1191
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,760
seriously i'm going to run quickly

1192
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,920
through the section headers and anyone

1193
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,400
can just

1194
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
raise their hand and i'll pause the

1195
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,520
section headers

1196
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,720
just to address the question so first

1197
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,800
there's an introduction of the paper

1198
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,319
which makes sense because there's so

1199
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,079
many areas that are being tied together

1200
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,280
here

1201
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,800
there's the first figure which is about

1202
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,760
markov blankets and active inference

1203
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
in the second section of the paper which

1204
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,920
is called a variational principle for

1205
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,200
living systems

1206
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
first they talk about this variational

1207
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,280
free energy formulation

1208
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,640
for living systems and show a figure of

1209
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,400
how the free energy principle and

1210
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
self-evidencing are related

1211
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,359
to living systems they then talk about

1212
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,920
generative models and action policies

1213
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,359
because when we're talking about

1214
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,079
internal

1215
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,480
models or internal states of an organism

1216
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,160
we're talking about generative models

1217
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,560
and action policies

1218
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
they then talk a little bit more

1219
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,680
specifically in the text

1220
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,000
about markov blankets and the boundaries

1221
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
of cognitive systems

1222
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,040
which recalling their goals they're

1223
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
going to take us to somewhere where

1224
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,839
these boundaries are

1225
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,839
real and they're not equally prescient

1226
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,359
as they say however

1227
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,040
that doesn't imply that there's one

1228
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,760
single correct level of analysis

1229
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,480
this is related as maxwell also brought

1230
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,599
up earlier

1231
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,839
on the formal ontology for the

1232
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,599
boundaries of cognitive systems

1233
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,319
because the modeling approach the

1234
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,400
descriptive or action-oriented modeling

1235
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,599
approach that we take

1236
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
to a system is related to how we think

1237
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,880
about it and so that's the

1238
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
background if your ontology has a

1239
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,240
certain type of scheme

1240
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,560
pre-built pre-installed then your models

1241
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
are downstream of that

1242
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,440
so when we're talking about philosophy

1243
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,200
of science philosophy of multi-scale

1244
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
systems

1245
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,040
complex systems we're talking about what

1246
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
ontology will let us

1247
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
draw the boundaries around these systems

1248
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,680
in a way that's yes

1249
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
useful but also aware about these other

1250
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,119
aspects

1251
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,960
and the fact that we're not the only

1252
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,319
perspective on use

1253
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,920
out there this takes us to section three

1254
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,319
on cognitive boundaries specifically

1255
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,280
this debate

1256
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,760
long-standing between internalism and

1257
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,800
externalism

1258
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,040
it ends with an ism so it's a dogmatic

1259
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,920
belief

1260
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,119
and it um is just what it seems to be

1261
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,880
it's about whether the external

1262
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,960
factors in cognition or whether the

1263
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,720
internal factors in cognition

1264
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,200
play a more relevant role or a primary

1265
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,839
role

1266
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,000
and the internal and the external are

1267
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,079
implicitly at the level of the organism

1268
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:16,560
and so

1269
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,960
one of the i think strongest stances of

1270
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
this multi-scale analysis

1271
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,640
is well isn't there an internal and

1272
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,000
external to the group

1273
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,920
isn't there an internal and an external

1274
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,359
to the enacted

1275
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,599
ecological cognition like a human in a

1276
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,880
building with a computer

1277
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,640
what does internalism and externalism

1278
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,319
mean when we're talking about

1279
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,920
niche construction when we're talking

1280
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,319
about sociological systems

1281
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,720
and so to explore that first they talk

1282
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,599
about

1283
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,400
externalism in the context of radical

1284
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
views of cognition

1285
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,800
so radical means from the root and so

1286
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,720
to take it from the root that

1287
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
externalism is the nature of cognition

1288
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,880
would be to kind of have a causal model

1289
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,480
where the outside things are more

1290
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,200
causative

1291
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,560
going in rather than the other way

1292
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,200
around in figure 3

1293
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
there's a very nice abstract

1294
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,319
representation of

1295
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,560
operational closure which is actually

1296
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,359
related to

1297
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,079
kant and the idea of teleology and

1298
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,200
whether the organism

1299
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
is the fundamental unit of analysis in

1300
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
biology or whether other levels might be

1301
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,960
important too

1302
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,319
and figure four shows from a autopoetic

1303
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,440
um point of view about auto catalytic

1304
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,079
closure

1305
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,680
and so it's relating using a few

1306
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
different metaphors including uh

1307
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,839
autocatalysis like a metabolic loop

1308
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,400
metaphor for closure as well as an

1309
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,839
informational closure that will be

1310
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,560
returned to

1311
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,599
when talking about the markov blanket

1312
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,720
internalism is then given their say and

1313
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,200
it is pushing back against externalism

1314
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,760
and

1315
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
if one can imagine what radical

1316
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,680
externalism looks like you can probably

1317
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,400
imagine

1318
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,680
what radical internalism looks like

1319
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
and then after bringing up in section

1320
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,839
two the variational free energy

1321
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,720
principle and then

1322
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,440
in section three framing this debate

1323
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,720
about internalism

1324
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,280
and externalism in section four we

1325
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,200
combine sections two and three

1326
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
which is to say that we apply the free

1327
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,359
energy principle formalism

1328
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,000
to taking it seriously integrating

1329
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
multi-level systems

1330
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
between internalism and externalism or

1331
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,560
moving beyond it

1332
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,599
and that implies re-analyzing

1333
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,520
generative models what they are and how

1334
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,920
they're used to study cognition

1335
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,960
a section called inactivism 2.0 which is

1336
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,079
a callback to

1337
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,160
earlier uh generations of an activism

1338
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
then there's a section on nestedness or

1339
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,480
how to study cognition beyond the brain

1340
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,440
so okay neuroscience or behavioral neuro

1341
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,720
is about what's happening in the brain

1342
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,319
but that's nested within a body that's

1343
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,760
nested within a social group

1344
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,920
so how does this nestedness change how

1345
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
we study cognition in the brain and

1346
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,640
beyond

1347
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,720
and that's represented in figure 5 with

1348
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
this blanket of blanket ideas

1349
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,160
and in figure 6 with a multi-scale

1350
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,640
self-organization and active inference

1351
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,000
figure and then the paper closes with

1352
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,480
a movement towards multi-disciplinary

1353
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,240
research heuristics for cognitive

1354
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,040
science

1355
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,280
so just as far as today's discussion

1356
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,119
goes in the next 30 minutes

1357
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,440
we're gonna try to run through the

1358
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,359
abstract and the figures and then we'll

1359
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,480
have some closing

1360
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,720
thoughts and then that will hopefully

1361
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,960
get everyone excited and interesting

1362
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,400
thinking about different types of

1363
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,800
questions which we'll be able to address

1364
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
in live session 5.2

1365
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,079
in the service of the half hour we have

1366
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,760
to get through the six figures

1367
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,480
i'm just gonna put the abstract part one

1368
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,440
up here

1369
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,960
what they're doing is presenting a

1370
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,640
multi-scale integration

1371
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,240
interpretation of the boundaries of

1372
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
cognitive systems and they're wanting

1373
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,440
this to be a corrective

1374
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,280
for the debate between internalist and

1375
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,920
externalist positions

1376
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
the second part of the abstract they

1377
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,200
discuss how they first

1378
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,839
survey key principles of this radical

1379
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,920
extended or externalized cognitive

1380
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,040
perspective

1381
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,880
also implicitly in the context of the

1382
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,559
internalist perspective

1383
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,800
and then they develop a multi-scale

1384
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,480
account building on the free energy

1385
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,119
principle

1386
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,960
trying to move beyond this internalism

1387
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
externalism debate

1388
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
and then in the third part of the

1389
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,520
abstract they close up that discussion

1390
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,359
by saying that their approach does not

1391
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,040
privilege any specific given

1392
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,880
boundary of the world but it also

1393
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,400
doesn't argue that all boundaries are

1394
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,000
equally prescient so that's going to be

1395
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,920
something interesting to unpack

1396
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,319
and then they close just by saying that

1397
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,040
they

1398
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,119
are drawing the boundaries of cognitive

1399
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,240
systems

1400
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,319
using this multidisciplinary research

1401
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,400
approach

1402
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,839
so let's get to the figures and this

1403
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
first discussion let's just try to

1404
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,240
understand what are the figures about

1405
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,119
what is being shown in the figure just a

1406
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:47,760
first pass

1407
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,319
level visually what do you see but also

1408
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,000
where does it fit a little bit

1409
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,720
more broadly into the a to z of the

1410
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,680
paper

1411
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,079
or just what did you think about the

1412
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,760
figure what did you see in the figure

1413
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,720
or what were you wondering about so here

1414
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,280
we are

1415
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,559
in figure one would anyone like to

1416
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,440
take a first pass at describing figure

1417
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:09,839
one

1418
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,559
what they see or um what it shows or

1419
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,839
means for the paper

1420
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,240
all right so i'll start describing it

1421
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,680
and someone can okay max well go ahead

1422
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,720
well so this is uh this is a depiction

1423
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,800
of a mark called blanket

1424
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,319
uh and so markov blankets are one of the

1425
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,720
uh kind of building blocks or

1426
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,079
ingredients

1427
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,200
uh that go into uh the free energy

1428
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,800
formalism um and

1429
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,960
essentially a mark called blanket uh

1430
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
well mathematically what it does

1431
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,319
is uh if you have a set of random

1432
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,680
variables

1433
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,359
um and you want to effectively

1434
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,359
uh map uh or individuate is

1435
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,760
a random variable or a set of random

1436
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,440
variables from another

1437
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,240
set of random variables so for instance

1438
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,800
um

1439
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
you know you want to individuate a

1440
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,079
system like the brain

1441
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,119
from all the other uh you know dynamical

1442
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,040
uh systems with which it interacts well

1443
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,119
what you do is that you stipulatively

1444
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,319
define

1445
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,440
uh a third set of states uh between uh

1446
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,480
the the internal states of the system

1447
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,119
that you're

1448
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,680
interested in discussing and the

1449
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,720
external states

1450
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,520
of the embedding environment this third

1451
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,839
set of states is called a markov blanket

1452
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,640
and it's defined by the absence of

1453
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,240
connections

1454
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,599
so effectively uh the

1455
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,000
internal states are influenced by

1456
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,359
sensory states but do not

1457
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,880
influence them and um external states

1458
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,200
are

1459
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
influenced by active states but do not

1460
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,599
influence them so by precluding

1461
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,440
these two uh basically directed edges of

1462
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,359
this kind of connected graph

1463
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,960
what we're doing is uh essentially

1464
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,480
formalizing the kind of

1465
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,599
channel through which any interactions

1466
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,400
between

1467
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,920
uh the environment uh and the uh

1468
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
systemic well the the internal uh states

1469
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,160
of the system

1470
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,240
have to ha it has to go the interactions

1471
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,440
have to go through this channel

1472
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,640
effectively

1473
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,760
um so uh yeah that's what that's what

1474
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,720
the

1475
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,599
formalism does for us it it it allows us

1476
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,720
to individuate

1477
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,559
a system formally in terms of the

1478
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,240
interactions that it has with this

1479
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,119
with with its embedding environment

1480
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,319
great and

1481
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,440
mel go for it

1482
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,280
yeah i think a lot of a lot of people

1483
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,920
publishing on on the fep and the markov

1484
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,079
blanket formalism

1485
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,040
but even more so in kind of the

1486
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,000
discussions you get after a conference

1487
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,520
people really expect of the markov

1488
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
blanket formalism that it's

1489
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,599
that it's picking out not um

1490
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,400
token distinctions but type distinctions

1491
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,040
so

1492
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,599
so people really want the markov blanket

1493
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,800
formalism to

1494
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,480
cut at natural joints that is to to find

1495
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,599
kind of the type boundaries between

1496
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,160
natural kinds sorts of natural systems

1497
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,240
um and it really doesn't do this

1498
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,760
it really really doesn't do this it

1499
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,480
really picks out individual systems

1500
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,440
that's what it does

1501
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,960
is it finds token systems

1502
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,559
um and

1503
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,960
naturally i think a a formal methodology

1504
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,960
that that isn't about um

1505
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,520
it's not about finding privileged scales

1506
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,720
privileged

1507
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,680
uh spatial scales or privileged time

1508
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,640
scales it's

1509
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,960
uh it's about finding particular systems

1510
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,480
and so i think naturally when we employ

1511
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
this formalism it's not going to lend us

1512
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,040
a view

1513
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,599
of um of privileged scales because

1514
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,960
that's not what formalism does

1515
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,640
cool and i think that's kind of against

1516
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,160
goes against what people tend to think

1517
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,760
the markov blanket formalism is for

1518
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,800
awesome muddy um

1519
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,960
i was just gonna say that uh so i would

1520
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,839
say that most people

1521
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,440
on this call are far more intelligent

1522
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,040
than i am

1523
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,319
and i i try to come up with with my own

1524
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:28,720
sort of

1525
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,040
baby interpretations of this which to my

1526
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,079
knowledge nobody has

1527
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,640
been angered by what and i think really

1528
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,520
what this

1529
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,800
tells me is if i have an agent

1530
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,160
that is interacting with an environment

1531
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,720
the only the only channel by which they

1532
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,160
can actually

1533
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,760
update their beliefs in order to change

1534
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,319
their actions say comes through this

1535
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,000
sort of border state these sensory

1536
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,359
states so it's

1537
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,280
it's interesting in that um i don't

1538
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,480
consider this

1539
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,240
well i mean it is a separation obviously

1540
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,680
between two between two

1541
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
um objectively different realities

1542
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,680
should we say but it also

1543
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,720
um it speaks to the the

1544
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,160
force with which uh um

1545
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,800
the the analytical link between the two

1546
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,280
through

1547
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,960
a certain set of sub states which is

1548
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,400
which is really important

1549
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,559
right and this is this border set on on

1550
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,839
all your sensory states

1551
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,760
so your sensory inactive state so that's

1552
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,359
kind of how i've always

1553
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,920
viewed this i have two sets of realities

1554
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,280
that are trying to come together in

1555
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,240
terms of

1556
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,040
what's going on one of them has a belief

1557
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,800
state one of them just is

1558
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,200
and the the belief state is really

1559
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,040
trying to figure out what is

1560
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,440
and the only way it can do that is by

1561
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,359
modifying its sensory state so that's

1562
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:41,920
just

1563
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,000
something which for maybe people who

1564
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,160
aren't actively part of the community

1565
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,760
might make it a little bit more

1566
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,280
reductionist and simple to

1567
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,559
to digest but if anybody disagrees with

1568
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,280
me please

1569
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,480
let me know nice well said um richard

1570
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,839
and then if anyone else wants to raise

1571
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:58,880
their hand

1572
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,319
yeah so i'm sure this is probably a

1573
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,920
naive question but you know when i was

1574
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,599
listening to maxwell talk about it and

1575
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,040
looking at this figure

1576
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,280
do you do markov blankets work in the

1577
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,720
sense of

1578
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,359
i i hypothesize a priori that there's a

1579
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,720
thing called an environment there's a

1580
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,160
thing called an organism

1581
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,760
there's a thing called sensory states

1582
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,680
and then the markov blanket allows me to

1583
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,359
go in and find it statistically and

1584
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,359
determine whether or not these things

1585
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,680
can be isolated you know empirically and

1586
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,599
therefore kind of reinforcing my idea

1587
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,079
that

1588
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,240
these things actually exist in reality

1589
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,880
or can i just feed a markov blanket

1590
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,720
a whole bunch of random data and it's

1591
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,160
gonna find something you know

1592
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,599
kind of that garbage in garbage out

1593
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,280
model so like

1594
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,559
when you're when we're talking about

1595
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,240
barcode blankets and finding these

1596
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,200
boundaries

1597
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,240
um how exactly does that does that work

1598
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,559
let's have maxwell just directly respond

1599
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,000
to that very nice question

1600
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,200
and then we'll continue on the stack

1601
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,119
with stephen and then mel

1602
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
uh sure um to answer that question it

1603
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,119
would be easier

1604
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,079
if you could change figures and go to

1605
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,000
figure

1606
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,319
let me just check on the in the paper

1607
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,559
it's figure five

1608
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,599
sure so this is my favorite figure uh in

1609
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:08,799
any of our papers

1610
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,000
uh and yeah so this

1611
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,119
this basically tells you uh what

1612
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,440
what's basically going on here uh in the

1613
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,400
construction of a markov blanket so

1614
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,599
um in more recent work this has been

1615
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,400
formalized in terms of two operators a

1616
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,920
grouping operator

1617
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,240
and um a uh

1618
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,440
a dimensionality reduction operator and

1619
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,280
effectively what we're doing is well so

1620
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,119
uh to answer the question richard's

1621
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,559
question directly

1622
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,440
uh in principle uh what we've been able

1623
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,119
to do recently

1624
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,480
is uh develop techniques that

1625
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,040
more or less automatically although you

1626
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,880
know we can discuss there are a few

1627
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,559
design decisions that have to be made

1628
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:54,960
and

1629
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,760
these have been discussed in a few of

1630
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,079
our

1631
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,000
discussion channels recently i'm sure

1632
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,240
mel will uh

1633
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,200
i'm sure you'll remind me of this uh but

1634
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,640
basically what happens is

1635
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,720
um what you do is you start with a bunch

1636
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,799
of states right so we're working from uh

1637
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,040
dynamical systems perspective

1638
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,920
and we define whatever states are of

1639
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,079
interest for us

1640
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,599
and essentially the markov blankets are

1641
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,200
constructed

1642
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,119
by looking at the relative rates of

1643
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,799
change of variables

1644
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,280
with respect to each other so

1645
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,720
mathematically what we're doing is

1646
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,440
taking the

1647
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,799
the partial derivatives of each variable

1648
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,920
with respect to each other and

1649
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,599
and then using effectively these

1650
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,400
rates of change uh to construct the mark

1651
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
all blankets automatically so

1652
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
you start with a bunch of states uh here

1653
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,079
i'm at the bottom panel in the figure

1654
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,920
where you have essentially these nine

1655
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,200
circles that represent states

1656
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,720
so i mean these can be anything

1657
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,680
whatsoever uh in a recent paper that was

1658
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,880
pre-printed

1659
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,359
this has been used to analyze fmri data

1660
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,160
so in

1661
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,240
in that paper each of your states is one

1662
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,480
3d voxel

1663
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,240
um and basically what you do is you

1664
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,160
write down an adjacency matrix

1665
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,200
uh so an adjacency matrix is uh

1666
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,400
effectively a a a matrix where you have

1667
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,880
all

1668
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,520
of your states by all of your states and

1669
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,040
the entries in the matrix are

1670
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,720
quantifying the effect

1671
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,760
the influence that one uh state has on

1672
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
another

1673
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,280
and if you take the if you take the

1674
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,599
jacobian of this adjacency matrix you're

1675
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,200
replacing all of these entries with the

1676
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,359
partial derivatives of one

1677
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,559
variable with respect to others and

1678
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,079
uh so having said all that you you can

1679
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,440
construct the markov blankets

1680
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,839
analytically by noting the the absence

1681
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,880
of dependencies in this adjacency matrix

1682
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,079
so zeros in your jacobian mean that

1683
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,240
the partial derivative of one variable

1684
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,160
with respect to that other variable is

1685
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,280
zero

1686
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,440
uh which is another way of saying that

1687
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,680
basically the two variables in question

1688
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,440
are conditionally independent in that

1689
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,119
direction

1690
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,640
um and so i mean there are a few

1691
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,920
modeling decisions

1692
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,880
uh that you need to make effectively uh

1693
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,280
there are most there are two to my

1694
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:21,920
knowledge

1695
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,319
one is basically uh going to be deciding

1696
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,680
which states

1697
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,799
are internal states uh

1698
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,240
effectively so you're going to say okay

1699
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,920
if this one is an internal state then

1700
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,760
its blanket is this and the external

1701
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,839
state's relative to it or that

1702
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,400
uh that arbitrariness isn't all that

1703
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,920
arbitrary in the sense that

1704
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,200
the you know uh the blanket structures

1705
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,720
are gonna be essentially the same it's

1706
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,680
just what

1707
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,200
what is what's going to count as an

1708
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,359
internal state might change

1709
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,359
um and then there are a few design

1710
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,799
decisions uh when you're

1711
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,240
when you're implementing this uh

1712
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,000
basically you have to when you're

1713
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,760
constructing your adjacency matrix you

1714
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,599
have to kind of decide what counts as a

1715
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,000
cutoff

1716
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,880
for interaction so those two things

1717
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,200
might make it less

1718
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,319
objective but in principle if you'll

1719
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,000
allow for these two kind of

1720
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,960
modeling decisions you can feed these

1721
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,040
algorithms

1722
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,040
like a time series data for example and

1723
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,359
it'll chunk out the markov blankets from

1724
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,960
it

1725
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,599
very nice answer maxwell thank you so

1726
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,359
we'll go to stephen and then mel

1727
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,799
then alex k and shannon

1728
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,520
okay just get my head into it but um

1729
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,160
one of the things that i think this also

1730
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,720
is

1731
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,359
maybe not always easy to imagine is that

1732
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,040
is the dynamical

1733
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,720
nature of all of this that it's talking

1734
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,040
about states so it's not you're never

1735
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,240
actually

1736
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,599
being one thing you're always in this

1737
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:52,160
state

1738
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,319
of um unfolding

1739
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,839
and that the markov blanket then

1740
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:03,200
is that kind of statistical kind of

1741
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,720
um you could say record keeping

1742
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,040
at the different scales ultimately i

1743
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,400
would say everything's at the

1744
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,799
cell level to some level because that's

1745
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,240
the kind of engine

1746
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,839
that's enabling everything else to be

1747
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,280
created the only thing i kind of

1748
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,280
feel that is important to maybe

1749
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,799
distinguish when talking because i think

1750
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,200
there's a danger with the word systems

1751
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,880
is that there's like i see these

1752
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,440
blankets as more like a swarming

1753
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,359
of um statistics which

1754
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,240
creates the structures and the networks

1755
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,599
such as the kind of

1756
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,880
leafs or whatever and they and it's that

1757
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,599
kind of structures which actually are

1758
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,000
kind of in the world so to speak and

1759
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,839
those structures have systemic

1760
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,440
properties i.e

1761
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,039
they become the um support mechanism for

1762
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:55,760
a plan

1763
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,799
the leaf does or but the structure has

1764
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,240
come out from the swarming

1765
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,440
of the um actual blankets

1766
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,000
so that's just i think i'm still trying

1767
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,440
to get my head around how to

1768
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,480
pass it nice we can return to that

1769
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,680
mel and then alex k

1770
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,839
yeah i think i think maxwell basically

1771
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,039
said it all but but

1772
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,160
the the short of it is um

1773
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,720
you have some time series basically and

1774
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,960
that could be that could be um

1775
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,079
real data or that could be uh sim

1776
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,319
data that could be simulation right and

1777
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,400
you're pointing the mark off blanket

1778
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,280
formalism

1779
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,520
you're directing it to the internal

1780
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,319
state

1781
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,160
and you're handing it your threshold for

1782
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,760
for how conditionally dependent should

1783
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,240
be conditionally independent enough

1784
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,000
to count um and then

1785
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,440
that does the rest of the work for you

1786
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,200
that that that will partition

1787
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,880
your state so so you give it the

1788
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,720
internal states and you give it

1789
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,160
the kind of threshold for conditional

1790
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,839
independence and that partitions the

1791
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,000
rest into external states

1792
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,960
uh sensory states system active states

1793
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,599
cool

1794
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,799
alex k then shannon and muddy

1795
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,400
yeah just a really brief point i'm just

1796
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,480
wondering if one way of thinking of this

1797
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,119
is that

1798
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,359
the markov might get partitioned insofar

1799
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,559
as its objective

1800
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,880
um together with some data like maybe it

1801
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,000
maybe it cuts nature

1802
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,920
at particular joints but it just doesn't

1803
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,079
cut at types of joints

1804
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,920
in a way um so i don't know maybe we can

1805
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,680
pick that up later

1806
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,200
well yeah that's a good point if i can

1807
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,880
just jump in here i think mel

1808
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,559
is right when they say that uh

1809
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,559
like the so it's it's the the markov

1810
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,160
blankets are always going to pick out

1811
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,599
individuals uh if there's anything like

1812
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,000
a species level regularity that we can

1813
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,119
express

1814
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,680
or like a you know irregularities that

1815
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,760
are specific to members of

1816
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,799
members of the same group uh that'll be

1817
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,799
more in terms of the generative model

1818
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,280
non-equilibrium steady state density

1819
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,920
uh so i mean you know this is also

1820
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,520
discussed in the paper but essentially

1821
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,119
what we're saying is you can imagine a

1822
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,200
joint probability distribution all over

1823
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
all of the variables of the system

1824
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,520
and implicitly also over some fictive

1825
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,039
external states that the system is

1826
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,400
interacting with

1827
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,280
and this entire joint density uh you can

1828
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,280
think of as the phenotype of the system

1829
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,920
uh and it's known as a non-equilibrium

1830
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,680
steady state density

1831
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,200
or a generative model so i think yes

1832
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,680
things that pick out types have more to

1833
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,640
do with this

1834
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,960
uh joint density that tells you like

1835
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,559
about the kind of creature that i

1836
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,599
am whereas uh as mel was just pointing

1837
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,079
out like

1838
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,400
these are uh these these markov

1839
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,599
boundaries are effectively the

1840
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,839
boundaries of individuals

1841
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:45,280
every time so cool shannon

1842
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,079
and then muddy

1843
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,079
i think i might be echoing a lot of what

1844
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,359
was said already

1845
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:56,480
um but on on what

1846
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,920
the markov boundary is is is

1847
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,520
separating um it's always going to

1848
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,280
be a decision on the part of the

1849
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,400
researcher for

1850
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,079
for what correlations seem to matter for

1851
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,200
the explanation

1852
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,480
that you're looking for for the

1853
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,640
particular system's behavior

1854
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,039
so like if there's certain long-range

1855
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,440
correlations that are

1856
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,799
constraining short-range correlations

1857
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,119
whatever your whatever you're wanting to

1858
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,400
answer so if i want to answer

1859
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,039
how um a

1860
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,240
certain musical phrase affects the

1861
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,720
movement of the person listening to it

1862
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,440
the

1863
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,400
particular the particular

1864
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,640
um like enter the particular part of the

1865
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,640
system that's interesting to me is maybe

1866
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,039
not

1867
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,079
going to be the electro electrical

1868
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,359
firing of a neuron

1869
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,760
at that moment because the electrical

1870
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,839
firing of a neuron

1871
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,359
at that really short range correlation

1872
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,039
that really short-range time scale

1873
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,280
isn't going to have a huge effect at the

1874
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,440
long range time scale in my explanation

1875
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,039
even though it's important you can't

1876
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,720
have the reaction without

1877
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,280
the brain having some electrical

1878
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,400
activity

1879
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,400
it's still not the most informative

1880
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,000
scale of analysis

1881
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,200
nice muddy and then mel awesome

1882
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,839
i um so again just just bringing this

1883
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,960
back to

1884
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,039
uh a level of understanding that allows

1885
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,960
me to like get some sort of intuition

1886
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,640
why this hierarchical

1887
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,200
uh markup framework is is really really

1888
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,720
important and useful

1889
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,200
in defining dynamical systems so one

1890
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:37,760
example

1891
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,079
you know my background in in medicine

1892
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:40,880
reason why we

1893
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,559
we were interested in functional

1894
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,920
neuroimaging is we wanted to understand

1895
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,359
at what scale can we

1896
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,680
intervene in certain effective

1897
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,359
connectivity architectures in order to

1898
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,799
make clinical difference

1899
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,160
so understanding the boundary states

1900
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,480
of which pieces of this puzzle are

1901
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,079
genuinely boundary stage you know

1902
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,920
genuinely fall within some markov

1903
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,440
blanket is really really important

1904
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,400
and one example of this is if i take my

1905
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,160
auditory course effects and my visual

1906
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,119
cortex

1907
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,760
at a hierarchical level of processing in

1908
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,240
here

1909
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,039
one could say that the internal uh

1910
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:15,760
circuitry

1911
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,839
that allows me to interpret you know the

1912
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,839
the uh signals from my cochlear versus

1913
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:20,880
my retina

1914
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,640
are not correlated with each other

1915
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,160
however at

1916
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,839
an integrative state above this when i'm

1917
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:26,880
trying to actually make some sort of

1918
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,960
cohesive view of the world they are

1919
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,799
both of course within that same markov

1920
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,000
boundary state

1921
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,319
so here's an example of a hierarchical

1922
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,079
separation of boundary stage which is

1923
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,680
really really important not only from

1924
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,440
an empirical modeling decision in terms

1925
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,000
of like what level do i abstract but

1926
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,559
also

1927
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,640
from an understanding perspective you

1928
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,839
know one can

1929
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,079
say assume a boundary state and then

1930
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,680
test empirically if this

1931
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,760
if this is correct would say some sort

1932
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,520
of a dynamic causal model

1933
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,039
and simply just by changing what you

1934
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:57,920
think the actual

1935
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,319
markup boundary states are or you know

1936
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,280
the scopic level of that markov boundary

1937
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,599
um you can start inferring things that

1938
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,039
are really like clinically useful for

1939
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,920
example

1940
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,599
so the you know the motor cortex and um

1941
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,400
the cerebellum quite clearly form a

1942
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,520
markov boundary

1943
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,080
for motor processing but then motor

1944
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,000
cortex and s1 also form a markup

1945
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,439
boundary in terms of action decision

1946
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,399
making so

1947
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,560
this tool it's it's really a beautiful

1948
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,600
explanation of the world

1949
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,880
but it's really a beautiful modeling

1950
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,279
tool as well we're abstracting a way

1951
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,359
hierarchy called noise in terms of your

1952
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,520
model so i just wanted to add that in

1953
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,120
oh i think that's a great point i mean

1954
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,279
it it shows the kind of

1955
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,040
meta modeling uh strategy that we have

1956
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,839
going on here because

1957
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,719
so uh in another paper that i think

1958
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,719
you've discussed on this podcast a tale

1959
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,839
of two densities

1960
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,279
um uh i would i'm not sure that you did

1961
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:53,679
uh

1962
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,839
we've discussed a few anyway uh in

1963
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:01,198
uh in

1964
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,799
in that paper uh well actually

1965
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,120
maybe we should just i'll i'll just seed

1966
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,719
my my turn

1967
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,880
sorry no all good all good let's return

1968
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,759
to mel

1969
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,198
and then anyone else can raise her hand

1970
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,198
yeah just to quickly clarify um

1971
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,920
contrary to what alex said i think um

1972
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,040
the term

1973
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,439
the the phrase cutting at natural joints

1974
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,799
as it's used in philosophy of science

1975
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,040
actually refers specifically to

1976
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,520
to type distinction not not token

1977
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,719
distinction so it's actually

1978
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,198
it's about finding natural kinds and

1979
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,319
natural kinds are

1980
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,880
are definitionally type distinguished

1981
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,719
and altered distinctions

1982
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,198
yep also if i could add one note there

1983
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,198
from my field of gene expression

1984
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:45,839
analysis

1985
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,198
there's often a few different ways to

1986
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,759
construct a network of relevant genes

1987
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:50,319
for

1988
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,158
you could uh pull down and see which

1989
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,000
proteins are physically touching or

1990
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,679
which transcription factors are binding

1991
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,199
to which genes so that might be a

1992
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,280
protein-protein interaction network

1993
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,320
or a gene regulatory network or

1994
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,239
there are statistical networks like

1995
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,000
co-expression networks

1996
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
which are very related to things like um

1997
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,520
grainger causality or

1998
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,440
effective connectivity they're

1999
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,280
statistically derived

2000
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,520
and there might be two elements like two

2001
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,199
proteins or two genes or something

2002
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,040
that are correlated in their expression

2003
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,280
but never touch and those will come up

2004
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,560
on the functional connectivity matrix um

2005
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,920
or you might have two proteins that

2006
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,760
touch and actually are very integra

2007
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,320
integrally important for function but

2008
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,760
they're not expressed in a correlated

2009
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,719
fashion and so

2010
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,400
that might lead to them being missed on

2011
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,000
the co-expression graph or the

2012
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,080
co-activation graph on the brain

2013
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,679
and so then somebody might want to say

2014
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,840
well what's the what's the real

2015
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,080
map of the territory or what's the real

2016
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,560
network and that's where this meta

2017
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,520
modeling question returns and uh related

2018
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,800
to the carving of the joints

2019
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,199
yes on the top of figure one we see okay

2020
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,719
let's carve out the organism from the

2021
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,440
environment

2022
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,600
but that's not just a really close line

2023
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,880
around the organism

2024
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,800
that actually includes some long-range

2025
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,320
statistical dependencies

2026
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,920
as well as things that might be touching

2027
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,760
but not that important for regulating

2028
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,040
organismal states

2029
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,199
so there's multiple perspectives that

2030
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,080
are required

2031
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,760
and certainly multiple disciplines that

2032
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,199
are required when we want to be

2033
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,679
asking how do we design interventions or

2034
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:16,800
systems

2035
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,880
given this causal structure the endpoint

2036
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,560
isn't just scaffolding out this

2037
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,640
infinitely complicated reference map

2038
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,480
it's an action-oriented framework that

2039
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,320
we want to be talking about multi-skill

2040
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,880
models and then also knowing how to

2041
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,679
work within them sasha and then anyone

2042
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,199
else before we go to figure two

2043
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,400
um great point daniel about um

2044
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
the inter different kinds of

2045
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,640
interactions that exist in systems

2046
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,679
and whether it's um statistical or like

2047
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,480
physical

2048
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,520
correlation and

2049
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,760
i think the the kind of overarching

2050
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,960
theme here is that

2051
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,440
you wouldn't know unless you measured it

2052
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,239
and

2053
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,719
you need to know what sorts of variables

2054
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,360
are important

2055
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,400
in order to even see statistically if

2056
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,760
they're going to be related

2057
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,080
so that is where this kind of framework

2058
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,520
is really critical because we need to

2059
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,960
um measure the relevant

2060
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,199
things in our system and if things are

2061
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,520
happening at scales that are

2062
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,000
too long or too short outside the bounds

2063
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,040
of our measurement

2064
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,159
then we'll never know nice

2065
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,239
we'll do maxwell and then stephen and

2066
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,000
then move to figure two

2067
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,360
well i just want to pick up a bit on

2068
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,440
this meta modeling thing that

2069
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,280
that had been mentioned i think it it's

2070
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,000
one of the strengths of

2071
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,360
to it's one of the strengths of the

2072
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,440
framework to on the one hand

2073
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,040
um describe like the workings of

2074
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,239
organisms using this uh free energy

2075
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,840
minimization stuff so

2076
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,360
we're sort of uh we're sort of adopting

2077
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,400
uh the theory itself the free energy

2078
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,800
principle theory itself adopts an

2079
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,600
instrumentalist stance on organisms

2080
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,239
uh to say well what organisms are

2081
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:03,679
essentially doing is

2082
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,679
leveraging the statistical structure of

2083
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,520
their bodies in movement which we can

2084
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,520
interpret as a generative model as a

2085
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,120
joint density over all the system

2086
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,920
variables

2087
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,159
so using the statistical structure of

2088
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,239
their bodies in movement to generate

2089
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,960
adaptive patterns of behavior so at that

2090
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
at that first kind of theory level

2091
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,120
there's an instrumentalism uh that's

2092
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,199
going on and there's a kind of metal

2093
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,040
there's a modeling aspect going on we're

2094
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,960
saying that effectively

2095
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,280
organisms are sort of in a process of

2096
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,080
approximate

2097
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,560
bayesian modeling of their the causes of

2098
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,440
their sensory

2099
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,480
stimuli then there's a kind of meta

2100
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,480
level of analysis where we can actually

2101
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,719
as scientists write down a generative

2102
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,480
model that says well the markov blanket

2103
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,600
is here

2104
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,280
and then score that model in terms of

2105
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,120
the variational free energy

2106
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,440
and use a variational free energy

2107
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,679
approach to kind of find where

2108
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,320
the the boundary is of the variational

2109
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,080
free energy minimizing

2110
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,199
system so i i kind of take that uh

2111
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,679
you know meta aspect to be a strength of

2112
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,360
the the framework

2113
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,920
nice agreed um we'll go to stephen and

2114
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,560
then mel

2115
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,760
yeah and so following on from that as

2116
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,080
well

2117
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,360
the the the piece that sometimes gets

2118
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,960
maybe lost here but is in the other

2119
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,480
papers when you look at regime of

2120
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,760
attention

2121
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,600
is that it's not just that the system

2122
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,280
cleaves like the whole

2123
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,239
the the the mark of blanket gives a

2124
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,159
capacity to change how you take your

2125
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:30,800
attention

2126
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,360
from the stream that are coming in like

2127
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,239
i suddenly feel

2128
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,040
my hand then i feel my face and i

2129
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,480
suppose one of the things that would be

2130
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,360
an example

2131
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,120
as well of something that's a very large

2132
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,719
scale is

2133
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,480
the threat of climate change and i'm

2134
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,000
thinking about when i start thinking

2135
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,560
about

2136
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,800
a glacier in antarctica starting to come

2137
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,560
away and go into the

2138
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,480
the water and possibly raising sea

2139
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,560
levels in 20 years

2140
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,679
my physiology changes and my whole

2141
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,280
you know when i bring that into my

2142
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,800
considerations

2143
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,640
the way i take my attention and the way

2144
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,640
i tune to a lot of things

2145
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,239
around me in the world changes so

2146
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,520
you know is it is that has my system

2147
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,760
boundary changed or i would

2148
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,960
say that it's more about my attention or

2149
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,960
integration that's changed so that's

2150
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,719
where i think there's a

2151
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,560
question around whether the word systems

2152
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,560
could be overused sometimes

2153
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,640
and it's maybe sustained with this kind

2154
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,159
of statistical

2155
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,360
dynamic is quite quite useful right it's

2156
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
uh statistically influencing you

2157
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,040
whether you like it or not and then your

2158
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,280
awareness and your attentional regime

2159
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,679
is something that's almost separate

2160
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:40,400
awesome

2161
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,639
mel

2162
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,239
oh i just wanted to say um goodbye

2163
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:46,960
because i'm

2164
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,360
i'm supposed to be in another girl right

2165
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,480
now thank you

2166
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,880
for participating now awesome thanks for

2167
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,960
having us this is this is lovely

2168
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,560
cool so in the last couple of

2169
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,800
minutes i just wanted to get all the

2170
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,920
figures on

2171
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,440
the screen just so we could run through

2172
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,600
them let people take the next week to

2173
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,080
digest

2174
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,480
them a little bit more fully come for

2175
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,000
whatever exciting parts they were

2176
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,880
interested in

2177
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
so when i look at figure one i just see

2178
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,159
on the top the simplest

2179
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,199
framing of system from surrounding and

2180
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:17,679
if you

2181
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,679
think that that blurry that's a blurry

2182
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,040
boundary then

2183
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,120
you're not talking about a system so to

2184
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,880
be able to define something is to

2185
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,360
uh you know to delimit is to define so

2186
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,719
it might not be the most functional

2187
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,239
boundary but you can start there and

2188
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,080
then you ask well what kinds of

2189
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,880
states or interventions connect the

2190
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,480
system to the environment just like

2191
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,600
muddy was describing

2192
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,480
and those are described in this model as

2193
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,840
statistical dependencies

2194
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,000
and if we had to put english words on

2195
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,520
them they would be sensory states and

2196
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,320
active states

2197
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,159
but ultimately it's really about what

2198
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,080
the model actually says

2199
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,760
figure 2a goes into a bit more detail

2200
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,159
in that action perception internal

2201
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,120
external

2202
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,040
two-stroke engine as i think about it

2203
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,400
this feedback loop from

2204
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,239
internal and external states connected

2205
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,080
through sense and action

2206
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,159
and then the markov blanket is what is

2207
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,320
being pierced bi-directionally by sense

2208
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,040
and action

2209
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,880
and as we've talked about before and in

2210
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,960
some of the work on niche construction

2211
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,960
one systems internal is another system's

2212
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,400
external and so in

2213
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,920
some sense what is being uh discussed is

2214
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,920
that blanket state because there's some

2215
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,679
symmetry between the internal

2216
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,440
and the external in that both internal

2217
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,360
and external states have their own

2218
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,000
self-causing or autonomous dynamics as

2219
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,640
well as

2220
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,120
influence each other through sense and

2221
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,560
action respectively

2222
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,880
so figure two is just showing that again

2223
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,800
in the context of a human

2224
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,880
and then also connecting it a little bit

2225
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,640
more closely to the free energy

2226
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,520
formalism

2227
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,560
of energy minus entropy and so again

2228
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,199
another day for talking about the math

2229
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,320
there

2230
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,520
figure 2b just talks about how those

2231
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,840
formalisms of free energy respectively

2232
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,400
complexity minus accuracy on the action

2233
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,880
bound and then divergence plus surprise

2234
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,080
on the perception bound

2235
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,400
how the math sort of sketches out

2236
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,080
another day

2237
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,199
figure three is an illustration of

2238
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,679
operational closure so what they note

2239
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,440
here is that the black circles

2240
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,280
are forming part of an operationally

2241
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,280
closed network of self-organizing

2242
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,480
processes

2243
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,120
and this is something like teleological

2244
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:21,679
closure

2245
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:22,719
like if you're talking about a

2246
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,880
sustainable ecosystem you don't want the

2247
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,800
sustainable ecosystem to be defined from

2248
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,640
your front door to your trash can

2249
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,640
you're talking about operational

2250
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,000
functional closure

2251
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,400
existing at a higher level of analysis

2252
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,600
so that means the multi-level

2253
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,440
perspective is going to be important

2254
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,000
but at one level of analysis or at

2255
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,800
multiple

2256
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,840
we can ask has operational closure

2257
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,400
been achieved have we done enough system

2258
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,440
diagramming or

2259
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
mapping of causal relationships or

2260
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,560
dependencies

2261
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,040
such that we actually have the system's

2262
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,000
dynamics

2263
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,400
separated out from dynamics outside of

2264
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,360
the system

2265
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,679
if i can just jump in the the motivation

2266
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:00,880
for including this

2267
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,760
figure uh is part of the argument that

2268
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,719
we're making i think that's

2269
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,640
controversial is that basically

2270
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,280
most of what the inactive approach does

2271
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,719
uh we can do with the

2272
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,040
active inference approach but in a way

2273
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,159
that isn't just

2274
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:18,159
uh like uh well in a way that's

2275
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:21,199
formally backed you know by like a

2276
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,400
principled

2277
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,920
uh physics-based approach uh and so

2278
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,480
we're just discussing here the notion of

2279
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,239
operational closure

2280
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,199
uh that inactivists use to define an

2281
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:34,480
autopoetic

2282
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,199
uh entity like a self-producing entity

2283
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,400
and the argument that we make

2284
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,239
immediately after is that well

2285
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:43,280
uh active inference

2286
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,199
doesn't just doesn't just say there is

2287
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,960
this operational closure it tells you

2288
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,000
why there is operational closure

2289
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,800
nice and also to reference what we're

2290
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,920
talking about with

2291
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,960
mel just briefly um kant

2292
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,520
performed a teleological analysis and

2293
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,880
said that the organism

2294
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,560
is not just the limits per se of the

2295
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,239
epithelium not a physical

2296
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,360
boundary but it's actually the

2297
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,080
teleologically closed entity

2298
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,280
and so that is really consonant with the

2299
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,800
con with the idea that the

2300
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,600
eusocial insect colony is an organism

2301
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,280
not a superorganism by calling it a

2302
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,320
super organism

2303
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,040
we reify the boundary of organism being

2304
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,320
at the epithelia

2305
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,679
and people say oh well it's like a

2306
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,199
superorganism it's all these little

2307
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,280
insect organisms working together

2308
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,679
but actually because of the major

2309
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:30,560
evolutionary

2310
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,960
shift in eusociality in the ants for

2311
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,920
example

2312
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,400
the colony is the organism we don't draw

2313
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,159
a little single cell organism barrier

2314
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,920
around each one of our cells and then

2315
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,760
spend all of our time running the math

2316
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,600
on the altruism between the nerve cell

2317
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,719
and the muscle cell and

2318
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,120
the the sex cell and things like that we

2319
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,840
just say no

2320
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,000
that's the teleological level the liver

2321
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,040
is going to make sense

2322
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,320
in a broader end and that end is the

2323
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,280
organism

2324
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,199
and then the question about what the

2325
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,600
privileged level of analysis should be

2326
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,560
the organismal teleological analysis

2327
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,920
says right the liver and the stomach

2328
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,760
makes sense at the level of the organism

2329
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,600
but in some sense doesn't the organism

2330
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,520
only make sense in the context of its

2331
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,159
cultural

2332
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,800
niche and of its social relationship so

2333
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,480
why stop there where should the

2334
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,400
teleological closure end where should

2335
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,159
the functional closure end

2336
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,880
and that's what demands i think a true

2337
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,760
multi-level

2338
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,520
perspective because there's going to be

2339
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,199
questions where the functional boundary

2340
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:25,600
is

2341
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,280
the epithelium around the person or

2342
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,120
around the single ant nest mate

2343
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,800
but there's other times where what we're

2344
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,560
talking about is the closure around the

2345
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,320
organism as the teleological hole

2346
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,000
and that's not always the same thing as

2347
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,560
the epithelium yeah richard

2348
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,560
yeah i i think this general argument is

2349
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,159
is really captured well in the

2350
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,159
in the craver and darted mechanistic

2351
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,920
philosophical perspective to where

2352
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,800
a phenomenon is defined by the entities

2353
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,800
and activities that generate it or

2354
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,040
produce it and so whatever phenomenon

2355
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,040
you just you define whether it's the ant

2356
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,159
it's the colony

2357
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,560
there's going to be some mechanism that

2358
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,320
that generates it and that mechanism is

2359
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,600
decomposable

2360
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,920
down to whatever you want so the colony

2361
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,679
can be decomposed down to the individual

2362
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:06,320
ant

2363
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,600
which can be decomposed down to the

2364
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,360
various biological structures

2365
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,360
and really when you want to move up and

2366
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,679
down you're just simply identifying okay

2367
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,280
what are the entities and activities

2368
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,719
that generate a phenomenon that then

2369
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,480
interacts with other phenomenon

2370
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,719
entities and activities to create that

2371
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,400
right and you build up and down

2372
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,159
because i think i think it gets really

2373
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,320
dangerous in sociology we do this a lot

2374
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,040
to where

2375
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,560
there is no individual there's only

2376
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,920
society and there's theological

2377
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,719
reasoning

2378
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,199
where it gets very hard to keep track of

2379
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,400
okay well

2380
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,719
bob commits a crime not the entire

2381
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,719
society that bob's a part of so how can

2382
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,560
i drill down on bob

2383
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,800
as an entity that i want to talk about

2384
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,880
but then recognize that bob is part of a

2385
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,000
of a larger structure

2386
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,360
and not reducing it to the the group as

2387
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,040
the entity in itself

2388
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,480
yes it's 100 um related to that

2389
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,719
book of helen longino whether you know

2390
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,159
was it the arm that committed the

2391
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,840
aggression was it the person

2392
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,639
or was it the group and so it's funny

2393
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:03,760
i'm sorry

2394
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,800
you mentioned that because i mean that's

2395
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
kind of a symptom in schizophrenia where

2396
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:07,600
a lot of

2397
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,520
criminals will say i didn't kill him the

2398
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,719
bullet did and

2399
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,880
and then logically that makes sense in

2400
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,239
terms of that reasoning

2401
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,320
but any rational person would say well

2402
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,000
no you pulled the trigger so therefore

2403
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,880
the bullet

2404
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,480
is responsible you know are you

2405
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,159
responsible for the bullets pathway

2406
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,840
well no no i didn't kill him the bullet

2407
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,520
did so that that logic i think when

2408
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,360
pushed to its logical extreme

2409
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,159
um breaks down pretty quickly but yet

2410
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,679
nonetheless i think we do tend to

2411
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,520
implicitly rely on it a lot in our

2412
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,560
analysis

2413
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,719
yep and before we go to stephen it's

2414
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,639
again it's those causal stories

2415
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,040
guns don't kill people people do well

2416
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,800
depending on cognitive diversity that

2417
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,080
statement is going to

2418
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,159
sound true or not to you and someone

2419
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,440
could say well it's not even the bullets

2420
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,960
it's actually blood loss or it's not

2421
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,639
even blood loss it's reduction in blood

2422
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,280
pressure

2423
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,840
where does the causal chain end and so

2424
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,639
at some point

2425
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,880
we need to cut through the descriptive

2426
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,400
approach with an action-oriented

2427
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,000
approach okay are we gonna ban

2428
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,800
bullets guns people where do we stop

2429
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,480
there's no single answer just from

2430
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,400
identifying the territory

2431
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,040
to action and so these are really the

2432
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,520
big

2433
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,080
questions about causal relationships in

2434
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,679
multi-level systems we'll go with

2435
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,120
stephen and then muddy

2436
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,159
yeah i think the ability to have these

2437
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,600
mechanisms

2438
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,960
is made possible because of processes

2439
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,239
so we think about this in art because

2440
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,560
art is seen as a process

2441
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,800
that is creating something so in the

2442
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,480
same way with the ants

2443
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,600
there may be a mechanism by which ants

2444
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,280
chew up and masticate pieces of um

2445
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,159
wood or mud and there's a mechanism by

2446
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,239
which they build the ant colony

2447
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,600
and that ant hill has a structural

2448
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
integrity that allows air to flow

2449
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,840
through certain systems of

2450
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,239
movement that creates a cooling effect

2451
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,679
however

2452
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,040
the processes which i think the markov

2453
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,880
blankets are working with

2454
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,760
are what make the mechanisms possible to

2455
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,560
happen

2456
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,199
like the ant is following these kind of

2457
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,639
statistical dependent

2458
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,080
processes to do what it does and in

2459
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:12,800
doing so

2460
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,960
it has a mechanism just like if

2461
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,800
someone's firing the bullet

2462
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,120
there's a process the body's using to

2463
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,159
infer

2464
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,679
yet the mechanism is something we see

2465
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,320
so i think this is these these things

2466
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:26,719
are

2467
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,520
kind of entwined but they are slightly

2468
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,120
different

2469
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,320
agreed muddy and then back to maxwell

2470
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,440
um i guess this is where my original

2471
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,080
gripe

2472
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,960
with philosophy of science came is from

2473
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,880
that from an empiricist point of view

2474
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,480
for me you know where do you snip the

2475
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,000
causal chain

2476
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,159
is something that can be empirically

2477
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,679
defined you know

2478
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,080
if i have an extremely strong coupling

2479
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,280
between action a and

2480
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,760
action b such that action b doesn't

2481
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,440
occur without action a

2482
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,520
then move the markup boundary beyond it

2483
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,600
right that's that's good so

2484
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,280
any time anyone says guns uh you know

2485
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,880
bullets don't kill people

2486
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,000
um people do or whatever sorry people

2487
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,360
don't kill people bullets do i don't

2488
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,080
know what the the

2489
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,239
spurious phrase is or whatever but you

2490
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,840
can say well let me actually empirically

2491
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,040
look at this

2492
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,199
what percentage of uh and i'm sure there

2493
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,560
is like somebody's going to come with an

2494
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,000
example oh there was this gun that went

2495
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,400
off

2496
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,560
itself whatever but statistically

2497
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,800
speaking if i threshold that i can find

2498
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,080
basically a probability of one

2499
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,080
or very very or tending towards this

2500
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,320
that the gun was fired by a human being

2501
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,760
so i think it's a bit of a when somebody

2502
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,800
when somebody presents such a

2503
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,400
philosophical argument i'm like well you

2504
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,159
know there is an empirical response the

2505
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,400
science gives you these empirical tools

2506
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,360
to infer these

2507
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,000
sorts of things so that's kind of where

2508
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,520
my my original gripe about the

2509
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,719
phosphorus science coming out

2510
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,080
again i've softened on it but i just

2511
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,000
wanted to say i think there's an answer

2512
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,360
to these things philosophically

2513
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,639
and it comes from sampling the data

2514
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,360
cool uh maxwell before we finish out the

2515
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,639
figures

2516
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,960
cool uh well i just want to think about

2517
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,639
something that was mentioned in the chat

2518
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,239
by richard is that the

2519
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,960
so there isn't any i think systematic

2520
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,360
work that relates the free energy stuff

2521
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,480
to uh neo-mechanistic philosophy

2522
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,520
a la craver something i'd like to

2523
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,199
discuss with you all next week is

2524
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,400
um so as i understand it the

2525
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,679
multi-level framework i started off as a

2526
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,360
neo-mechanist i have to say like

2527
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,040
uh you know the the craver bechtel

2528
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,800
orientation was really something that i

2529
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,120
was pursuing

2530
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,560
and around 2013 2014 i i kind of

2531
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,000
spent a lot of time trying to see

2532
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,440
whether i was able to

2533
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,719
you know use the mechan the

2534
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,639
neo-mechanistic framework to articulate

2535
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,480
multi-level causation

2536
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,159
and my big gripe with uh neo-mechanism

2537
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:55,040
at least in

2538
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,159
its most popular renditions is that it

2539
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,000
effectively eliminates

2540
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,159
uh cross-scale uh causal effects

2541
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,239
so there's a part of this that i buy

2542
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,360
which is that you know

2543
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,600
part of my rejection of metaphysical

2544
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,000
levels comes from the neo-mechanist

2545
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,520
approach uh but i i think that

2546
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,000
because with the the the story we should

2547
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,159
discuss this maybe in in another podcast

2548
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,760
but the their story is something like

2549
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,400
well

2550
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,120
uh what looks like uh you know

2551
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,639
inter-level causation

2552
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,320
is really uh is really just uh

2553
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,159
it's it's just the same causal stream

2554
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,840
that you're redescribing at another

2555
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,800
level

2556
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,880
one of the things i like about uh the

2557
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
fep formalism is that while it's

2558
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,320
consonant with the broad

2559
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,480
outline of uh neo-mechanistic philosophy

2560
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,639
it does explain the way that you have

2561
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,199
causal effects that trickle up and down

2562
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,360
um so i think that's like an outstanding

2563
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,880
issue that that should

2564
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,159
potentially be uh discussed in a sort of

2565
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,159
flag that for the next episode

2566
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,800
yeah good call um alex k and then i'll

2567
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,560
close out the figures

2568
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,920
all right i was i was actually gonna

2569
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,280
lower my hand because that maxwell said

2570
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,719
we could discuss this another time but i

2571
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:07,120
guess i

2572
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,960
briefly just wanted to say yeah i think

2573
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,800
if you if you go back to like kant's

2574
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,639
definition of mechanism which i can't

2575
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,440
recite but

2576
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,600
uh basically he contrasted mechanism

2577
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,080
with systems that involve top-down

2578
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,159
sort of causation as well like you know

2579
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,320
that holes can affect parts

2580
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,480
i i would guess you could still get some

2581
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,080
kind of mechanistic description at each

2582
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,840
scale or like approximately or something

2583
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,159
but

2584
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,920
anyway i think it's an interesting topic

2585
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,199
oh yeah yeah just

2586
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,320
to be clear my view is that the fep

2587
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,520
is broadly consonant with uh and is in

2588
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,960
fact an exemplar

2589
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,679
of the neo-mechanistic research strategy

2590
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,760
as outlined by bechtel and craver

2591
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,239
and so on but i think it it does impose

2592
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,560
a different metaphysics of levels

2593
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,360
uh than the one that's been uh attempted

2594
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,719
at least in a few papers

2595
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,800
uh that i saw by bechtel and company

2596
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,760
like the one called

2597
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,040
looking up down and around i think uh

2598
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,239
where they essentially say that well

2599
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,560
there's no such thing as cross-scale

2600
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,120
uh influences they're really just big

2601
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,280
things interacting with small things

2602
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,480
and uh that's where i i think i strongly

2603
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,520
disagree

2604
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,280
uh for reasons that hopefully will

2605
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,679
unpack uh next week and that are related

2606
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,360
to how these multi-scale

2607
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,239
systems are actually constructed and i

2608
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:20,560
mean

2609
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,320
essentially you've got the same base

2610
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,840
system uh

2611
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,440
that's acting so it's like i don't know

2612
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,239
it's a ladyman and ross style there are

2613
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,239
only basically quantum fluctuations or

2614
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:30,880
whatever

2615
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,480
but what you're doing is whenever you

2616
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,320
define a new scale of interactions

2617
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,360
you're adding

2618
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,159
a slower and spatially larger set of

2619
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,440
constraints on the same

2620
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,880
fundamental set of things so there is

2621
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,040
something like cross-scale talk

2622
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,719
in the sense that what it is to be a

2623
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,400
multi-scale system

2624
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,199
is uh essentially to have components

2625
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,280
that are constrained by successively

2626
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,000
higher

2627
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,280
level uh constraints on the dynamics

2628
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,480
uh so but i don't think ultimately this

2629
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,320
this conflicts with the philosophical

2630
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,239
perspective of neo-mechanism which

2631
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:05,600
ultimately at the end of the day just

2632
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,239
says well

2633
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,639
there are parts and processes and a

2634
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:09,679
mechanism is a

2635
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,760
coordination and an organization of

2636
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,600
parts and processes that produces some

2637
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,280
kind of interesting output that we can

2638
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,080
study

2639
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,600
so cool yep these are um alejandra

2640
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,880
go ahead yeah yeah thank you

2641
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,480
and just following up this idea uh

2642
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,920
you're saying max well i i was thinking

2643
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,480
um

2644
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,920
if is there any differences

2645
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,199
in how these hierarchies um

2646
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,480
in terms of blankets uh work

2647
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:44,480
i was wondering um at the cellular level

2648
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:48,960
uh maybe belief dating is kind of

2649
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,800
risky so the cell has to behave

2650
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,010
like having this generative model but um

2651
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,280
[Music]

2652
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,320
it's it's like it's phenotype but

2653
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,600
it's not learning uh i don't i don't

2654
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,000
know

2655
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,440
i'm maybe i i don't have um very clear

2656
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,920
what i'm thinking but if you go like up

2657
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,000
to the scale

2658
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,440
thinking like in the brain um level

2659
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,199
the blanket now um belief of dating it's

2660
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,480
it's it's crucial

2661
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,400
for for um like this bodily

2662
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,520
interactions and effective bodily

2663
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,639
interactions

2664
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:31,840
and this coupling with the environment

2665
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,480
so um

2666
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,760
my question is is there any differences

2667
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,880
in terms of

2668
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,159
how these micro blankets and blankets of

2669
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,760
blankets blankets work

2670
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,440
um and this it's also a hierarchy

2671
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,719
and how this hierarchy

2672
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,560
belief updating works

2673
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,679
let's let's let's return to this great

2674
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,679
question when we have a lot more time

2675
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,120
next week which is about

2676
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,800
the similarities and differences with

2677
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,719
different systems it's really something

2678
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:05,440
we should

2679
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,840
consider because i was gonna say this is

2680
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,120
like the question

2681
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,679
yeah that we address in this paper in

2682
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:12,800
large part

2683
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,639
uh i mean a quick answer to your

2684
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,719
question is that formally speaking

2685
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,120
there's a kind of self-similar pattern

2686
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,480
that that is occurring

2687
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,080
across all these different scales right

2688
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,159
so you have a non-equilibrium steady

2689
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,199
state density

2690
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,400
and a generative slash generative model

2691
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,600
uh the the and that is uh kind of

2692
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,440
directing policy selection in a way that

2693
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,480
maintains the

2694
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,440
blanket but that's a very very uh like

2695
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,199
abstract or information theoretic

2696
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,000
description

2697
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,840
and in effect uh like basically the

2698
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,760
the kind of data that's involved at

2699
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,320
every scale the mechanisms involved to

2700
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,000
make sure that your data

2701
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,600
the data that you're sensing fits your

2702
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,280
preferred data distributions all these

2703
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,480
things are going to be radically

2704
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,560
different from one scale to the next

2705
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,040
uh i mean yeah clearly the way that we

2706
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,560
update beliefs about ourselves

2707
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,280
by having a conversation while it has a

2708
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,239
formal

2709
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,040
while it may formally be identical on a

2710
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,080
kind of process

2711
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,880
or information flow level uh to like

2712
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,880
what our cells are doing like clearly

2713
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,520
this is different right like the the

2714
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,040
data streams with which we're dealing

2715
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,239
are different the ways that they're

2716
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,840
being managed they're different

2717
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,639
uh so yeah i mean the the there is a

2718
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:23,760
kind of fractal

2719
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,320
self-similar structure uh but it's at

2720
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:26,880
the

2721
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,560
it's at the level of the information

2722
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,880
flows not so much what makes up

2723
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,280
uh so in mechanistic terms the parts are

2724
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,920
different but the processes might be

2725
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,239
yep and it will be awesome to go into

2726
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,760
more detail because there's clearly

2727
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,800
differences between

2728
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,360
cells that embody their beliefs through

2729
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,119
morphology that might be slower time

2730
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,239
changing and

2731
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,960
brains that can rapidly emulate or at

2732
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,800
least you know simulate various

2733
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,800
phenotypes being neural states and in a

2734
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,239
previous paper we talked about

2735
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,920
whether those neural states are

2736
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,600
themselves phenotypes

2737
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,600
just to quickly run through these last

2738
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,280
figures figure four

2739
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,239
is an example of auto catalytic closure

2740
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,000
so this could be like a metabolic

2741
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,639
network or self-replicating nucleotide

2742
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,960
sequences or programs that replicate

2743
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,040
themselves with or without mutation

2744
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,360
and the point here is really to say that

2745
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,440
that kind of causal dependency structure

2746
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,679
that we saw in figure 3

2747
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,560
it might not just be bumper cars or ants

2748
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,840
bumping into each other

2749
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,159
it could be something like different

2750
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:27,520
types of information

2751
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,520
that are connected to each other and so

2752
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,360
as we start to think about different

2753
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,119
spatial temporal scales and all these

2754
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,800
different mechanisms that exist

2755
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,960
we want to find those invariances at a

2756
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,840
structural

2757
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,880
and dynamical levels that help us study

2758
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,320
this diversity of systems

2759
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,520
using a common formal framework figure

2760
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,159
five

2761
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,840
is something we already looked a little

2762
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,400
bit at but it is this fractal idea

2763
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,960
zooming in on the fractal broccoli and

2764
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,760
basically

2765
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,560
the left side has uh sensory and action

2766
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,119
states surrounding three gray nodes

2767
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,159
but that's itself zoomed in from a swarm

2768
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:02,480
of

2769
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,520
similar agents and so in a tissue maybe

2770
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,719
it's very patterned

2771
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,560
like in the skin cells the boundaries

2772
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,080
between the cells are very stable

2773
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,800
so they can have adhesive molecules that

2774
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
make it a functional

2775
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,320
skin sheet and they're still exchanging

2776
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,119
information

2777
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:20,400
in that grid topology but also maybe the

2778
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,159
swarm on the right side consists of

2779
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:22,639
moving

2780
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,480
subunits so like steven was talking

2781
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,840
about with a swarm

2782
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,159
and at that point especially it is

2783
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:30,400
important to have a statistically driven

2784
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,639
understanding of causal relationships

2785
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:34,560
rather than one that's just around

2786
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,719
drawing a dashed line around the system

2787
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,719
as we visually see it

2788
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,360
and then just lastly figure six which i

2789
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,400
think will be perfect

2790
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,280
to save for later especially because it

2791
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,880
in some ways does

2792
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,880
connect this action inference

2793
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,080
generalization

2794
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,520
to specifically morphogenesis which is

2795
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,520
an example of a phenotype decision

2796
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,719
making that people might not

2797
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,400
always expect to be put in the same

2798
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,080
category along with

2799
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,119
what it is our brains or cpus are doing

2800
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,440
but i think that's a perfect jumping off

2801
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,560
point for

2802
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,320
next week when we uh yeah nice

2803
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,080
and going through this is going to

2804
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,360
hopefully address

2805
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,320
alejandro's question uh i think so yeah

2806
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,280
this is a good

2807
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,440
jumping off point i think perfect and we

2808
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,800
have a few questions

2809
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,560
just prepared for next week but we're

2810
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,159
not gonna go to them now

2811
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,880
we will talk about that next time that

2812
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,679
concludes

2813
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,920
the main section and we'll also just

2814
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,360
have anyone can raise their hand and

2815
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,280
give a final point but i just wanted to

2816
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,239
say that

2817
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,639
we'll provide a follow-up form to our

2818
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,159
live participants i'll put it in this

2819
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,040
jitsi chat

2820
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,719
as soon as someone starts to give a

2821
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,159
final thought

2822
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,119
any feedback suggestions or questions

2823
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:45,760
from

2824
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,239
our listeners participants are always

2825
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:48,800
welcome

2826
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,560
of course everyone's engagement is

2827
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,800
welcomed and people can

2828
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,199
stay in communication with us so if

2829
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,400
anyone has their

2830
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,000
hand raised i'll be happy to hear their

2831
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,840
first thoughts while i post the link

2832
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,480
nobody's hand is raised but thanks again

2833
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,400
for the continued engagement with our

2834
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:08,880
work

2835
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,679
um it means a lot and i think this is

2836
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,520
extremely useful

2837
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,920
uh like both i think for for us as a

2838
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,440
little community working through these

2839
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,320
things and

2840
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,280
uh you know for the broader uh audience

2841
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:21,760
of

2842
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,679
the free energy active inference stuff

2843
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,520
so i'm very grateful thank you

2844
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,800
very much awesome um muddy

2845
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,800
um raised your hand and if anyone else

2846
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,840
wants to give any

2847
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,000
final thoughts what they reflected on

2848
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,679
from today's discussion what they'd be

2849
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,520
excited to hear about in next week

2850
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,639
discussion

2851
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,760
uh i was just going to say um thanks sir

2852
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,480
this is really really great i think um

2853
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,000
first of all just on a personal level

2854
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,840
it's great to get back involved with

2855
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,440
people who are much cleverer than i am

2856
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,239
and be surrounded by this this new

2857
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,639
knowledge but secondly i can really

2858
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,480
start to sense the snowball effect in

2859
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,159
the active inference community

2860
01:38:58,159 --> 01:38:59,760
it's only a matter of time before it

2861
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,600
really leads over into industry

2862
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,040
it's a really really exciting time to

2863
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,360
get involved in the space

2864
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,760
thank you all that's really good cool

2865
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,520
richard and anyone else

2866
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,080
freely raise your hand yeah i i think

2867
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,440
this is really interesting and i think

2868
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,040
there's there's so many different points

2869
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,719
of connection and interaction with so

2870
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,400
many different disciplines

2871
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,639
and um i think one of the difficulties

2872
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,480
is the barrier to entry is just so high

2873
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,679
in terms of the terminology the

2874
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,040
mathematics

2875
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,480
to try and rapid your head around these

2876
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,080
things but once you begin to understand

2877
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,520
it conceptually i think people can start

2878
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,159
go okay

2879
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,760
i know what this is and i can talk about

2880
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,360
this and so i think one thing to

2881
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,679
maybe you know discuss moving forward is

2882
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,360
are there ways to kind of get

2883
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,440
almost sandbox working groups where

2884
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,719
people can kind of start

2885
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,480
really empirically playing around with

2886
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,920
ideas and data sets

2887
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,000
um that kind of emerge naturally out of

2888
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,600
these conversations because

2889
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,880
you know cold calling somebody and

2890
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,400
saying hey i've got this idea can you

2891
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,000
explain to me what a marcotte blanket is

2892
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,520
let's work together people are like

2893
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,560
no son i got things to do i'm sorry

2894
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,920
i think you know there's a way that we

2895
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,760
can kind of merge from these really

2896
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,280
great productive working

2897
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,719
our discussions into maybe something

2898
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,560
where people start producing

2899
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,880
actual collaborations across disciplines

2900
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,239
i think would be a really fantastic

2901
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:08,880
thing

2902
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,280
awesome i i just want to reiterate also

2903
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,000
uh

2904
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,840
that there's this reading group uh

2905
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,040
that's ongoing

2906
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,040
on the carl firstens monograph so for

2907
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,480
those of you who are

2908
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,320
interested in actually uh you know uh

2909
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,239
surmounting the barrier to entry as it

2910
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:25,840
were uh we're

2911
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,199
we we've recorded uh the the chats and

2912
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,960
everything so if you do want to join

2913
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,199
just uh drop me a dm

2914
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:36,639
um and yeah we've grown to

2915
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,400
this is originally going to be like me

2916
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,000
and eight buddies just reading through

2917
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,360
the monograph and we've grown to a

2918
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,159
community of almost 100 scholars

2919
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:47,440
uh yeah following this uh

2920
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,600
like remotely with the recordings

2921
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,880
available and we're going to turn

2922
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,960
these recordings heavily edited and

2923
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,080
everything

2924
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,960
into pedagogical material a kind of like

2925
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,000
video based

2926
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,360
a companion to a free energy principle

2927
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,040
for a particular physics

2928
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,679
uh so yeah if anyone is interested uh

2929
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,119
the group is kind of semi

2930
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:10,639
loosely open um to especially the

2931
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,800
to people who are doing active research

2932
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,560
uh in the tradition

2933
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,080
so uh yeah drop me a dm and i'll all

2934
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,880
hook you up cool stephen and then anyone

2935
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,239
else if their last thought

2936
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,879
comes to mind

2937
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,360
yeah well just to reiterate yeah it's

2938
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,040
really useful i like to see everyone

2939
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,480
nibbling at this from different

2940
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,280
directions are sort of it it shows a lot

2941
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,880
the questions everyone's asking

2942
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:35,840
it's like because otherwise you're

2943
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,280
thinking it's just me that's thinking

2944
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,000
this

2945
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,600
and sometimes it is and then sometimes

2946
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,119
it's not so it's kind of good to know

2947
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:42,480
which is which

2948
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,400
because sometimes it's not clear it's

2949
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,320
just a figure of my imagination as the

2950
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,679
only other thing i thought might be cool

2951
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:48,400
to bring

2952
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,000
is that new paper that came out on

2953
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,480
reciprocal active influence that's just

2954
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,520
come out

2955
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,560
might be interesting at some point to

2956
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,880
think about because that might open up

2957
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,480
some another level of

2958
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,280
development from this paper a very

2959
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,639
interesting paper by matt

2960
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,239
sims uh at edinburgh who

2961
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,960
um i'm i've been very excited about this

2962
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,239
stuff

2963
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,360
so matt sims developed a um

2964
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,920
an account of symbiosis that draws on

2965
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,679
the multi-scale integration framework

2966
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:20,239
that we've

2967
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:23,520
uh developed uh where he

2968
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,239
talks about bi-directional uh

2969
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,320
multi-scale integration so not just

2970
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,119
integration

2971
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:31,360
of the parts of of one biological

2972
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,280
organism but the integration

2973
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,639
of effectively a symbiotic union of

2974
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,040
organisms with different phenotypes uh

2975
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,040
the paper uses the uh i think it's the

2976
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,320
bobtail squid

2977
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,520
that uh gets colonized by bacteria and

2978
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,000
so

2979
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,679
yeah it's a very very interesting paper

2980
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,119
and i highly recommend it

2981
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:53,679
cool cool very interesting sasha

2982
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,840
yeah i just wanted to reiterate what

2983
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,199
stephen just mentioned

2984
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:59,520
um it's great to have this ongoing

2985
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,480
conversation

2986
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,600
and to hear how different people phrase

2987
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,440
the questions that i think we're all

2988
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
thinking so i'm really looking forward

2989
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,800
to next week's discussion

2990
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,440
um and kind of uh seated with the

2991
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,719
question that alejandra

2992
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,320
stated earlier perfect well

2993
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,800
thank you all for participating the

2994
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,639
google form for you to provide any

2995
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,239
feedback for the live participants is in

2996
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,360
the chat

2997

in replay please provide us your

2999
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,119
feedback so we can make this

3000
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,119
better on-ramp for active inference the

3001
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,639
community the ideas

3002
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,760
and ultimately the projects too so it's

3003
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,159
just

3004
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:39,360
great stuff another one in the books 5.1

3005
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,080
for active and i'm going to terminate

3006
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,440
the live stream thanks so much for

3007
