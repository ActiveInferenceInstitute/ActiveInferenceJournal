please mute

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
if there's noise in your background and

raise your hand so that we can use the

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
stack to hear from everyone

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
as mentioned we are here in act imp

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
stream 5.2 and here's a little bit about

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
how today is going to go

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,360
first we're going to have our regular

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
warm-up section where we'll do some

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
intros and we'll check in with a few

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
questions

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
last time in active stream 5.1 we did

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
a pretty broad overview summary of the

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
paper went through the figures the goals

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
the abstract

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
and today in the follow-up discussion

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,360
part two

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,759
we're going to be going through first

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,400
off any

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
questions or comments that people want

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
to address and then after we've

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
exhausted that or if we're excited just

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,240
to get to

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
the other topics we'll go right ahead we

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,439
will

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,680
return to the debate about internalism

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
versus externalism because that is in

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
some ways what the

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,600
broader scholastic tradition that the

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
paper is involved in

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,520
is about we'll talk about markov

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,560
blankets

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
we'll talk about what it means to be

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
internal and what it means to be

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
generative

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
we'll talk about changing one's mind

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
we'll talk about free energy

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
minimization we'll talk about some of

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
the limits of cognition and science

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
and then we'll hopefully return to the

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
figures especially figure 6

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
and mechanistic differences in different

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,640
multi-scale systems

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
so here we are in the introduction

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,760
section

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239

106
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,360
coming in so let's go through our

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
warm-up questions

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
and we would love to hear from all of

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
you on these

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
the first warm-up question is what got

111
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
you excited for today's discussion what

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,599
brought you to the follow-up

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,880
discussion and people can raise their

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,279
hand

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,320
all start what got me excited was

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
that second phase of interacting with

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
the paper which is beyond

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
just a first pass what was said in the

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
paper and what the figures represented

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
to tie it to deeper questions and to

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
deeper ideas

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
yeah stephen yeah and what really

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,000
excites me

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
well there's a lot of stuff that came up

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
last week so that was really useful and

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,840
i got some new

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
insights but i'd say um i saw a

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
potential

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
way that it was moving towards this

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
multi-method potential to bring together

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
different ways of thinking

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,320
and practices so um i'm

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
i'm interested in how the kind of

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,360
different

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
levels sort of can come together in

136
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,360
different ways

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
and privilege different types of um

138
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
scales in ways which are actually quite

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
practical and useful

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,000
so that was that was really really

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,160
interesting

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
cool and we'll definitely talk about how

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,360
the different

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
scales come to bear if anyone else wants

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
to raise their hand otherwise i'll just

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
go to the second discussion question

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,639
which is

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
if at all how have you updated your

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
beliefs on multi-scale integration

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
since the last conversation i think that

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,880
was a

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,080
question from sasha so maybe i'll

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
go to her while other people are raising

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
their hand

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,919
while she unmutes um

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
yeah that was you know a bit of a cheeky

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,960
question um

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
but i think we got into a lot of

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
interesting topics last week

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
um uh you know

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
and really getting into um the

162
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
philosophy of science

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
um that was really interesting for me

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,720
and

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
uh it's a topic i hope to explore

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
especially in thinking about

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,319
um different levels of um

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
how to create the appropriate system for

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,919
studying cognition

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
and where to draw that boundary

171
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
um something i'm interested for

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
uh figuring out in my own work with

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,120
studying neuroscience and development

174
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
and um just really enjoyed hearing

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
everyone's perspective as well

176
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,240
so my uh my update was that um

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
philosophy of science is really critical

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,360
to uh

179
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
the practic practicality of experimental

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,039
design

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
yeah there's in many of these papers and

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
ideas there's us experiencing the system

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
we're apparently only experiencing our

184
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,400
individual cognition but then

185
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,599
what does it really mean to be

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
experiencing individual

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,080
cognition anyone else want to have a

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
thought on that

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
and also i'll just put up the third

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
question is

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
what would be something that you'd like

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,639
to clarify or

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,720
explore in today's conversation

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
so shannon

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
i'm really curious about um this idea

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,599
that the mind is skull-bound

197
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
while also giving cognition um to

198
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
extended systems that like extend beyond

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,720
the mind

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
especially in like being in a

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
neuroscience

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
lab and like what i am interested in

203
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,280
studying and explaining is how the brain

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
is involved with some cognitive process

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,039
um while also

206
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
understanding and not minimizing the

207
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,840
role that the body or the environment

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,560
plays

209
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
agreed um within the markov blanket of

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,319
this

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,680
conversation that we're having there's

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
some sort of distributed cognition at

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,400
play but

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
who or what is experiencing that and

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
what are the dynamics of that

216
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,360
type of cognition does anyone else want

217
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
to have any

218
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
thoughts on these questions or we can

219
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,840
just

220
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
start going through some of these quotes

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and ideas

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,039
okay i'm just gonna go into it

223
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
so here we are in multi-scale

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
integration

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
beyond internalism and externalism a

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,000
2019 paper

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
last week in 5.1 we went through it

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
pretty broadly today we're going to

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
follow up on some key quotations some

230
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
key ideas go through the figures

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,559
again in this sort of spiraling back at

232
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
a higher level

233
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
wanting to understand what is on the

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
table what are the implications of what

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,279
is being discussed

236
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
the goals of the paper just to rehearse

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
them were to make

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
explicit this description of the

239
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,279
boundaries of cognitive systems

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
uh as being multi-scale and so

241
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
when we think that the boundaries of

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
cognitive systems are nested and

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
multiple

244
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
and the implication of this to the

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,279
authors is that

246
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
cognition has no fixed or essential

247
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
boundaries and

248
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
where that sort of took me as far as the

249
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
slides go

250
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
was what were the implications of taking

251
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,360
multi-scale

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,320
integration seriously and how does free

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,800
energy

254
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
principle and free energy minimization

255
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
fit into all of this

256
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
so first is there anything that people

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,399
just want to

258
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
raise as something to address or

259
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
think about before we jump into some of

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,839
these topics

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
if not just feel free to write it down

262
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
and we'll return to it soon

263
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
okay for the first topic yes stephen go

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
ahead

265
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
just just one thing that i think might

266
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,399
be good to mention that came up is this

267
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,200
idea of

268
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,279
um how um we privilege

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
certain levels and maybe then end up

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
just stuck at that level

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,920
like a psychological level or a

272
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
behavioral level

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
or whatever so um

274
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
there's an implication i think in this

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,600
um

276
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,720
to to think about the levels

277
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
which is kind of maybe some way a bit of

278
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
an abstract thing

279
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
when across all the levels and how do we

280
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,760
actually

281
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
privilege in some sort of intentional

282
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
way

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
the levels that are going to be sort of

284
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,959
looked at as the kind of active

285
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,760
inference engines that are most relevant

286
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
so just that's something that came up

287
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
for me yeah i would

288
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,839
um actually like to follow up and ask

289
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,399
you

290
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
we talk about this privilege level of

291
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
analysis and

292
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,079
recall dennis noble's paper what does it

293
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,279
mean to privilege one

294
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
level of analysis or is that something

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,959
that is just

296
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,360
a priori to be avoided or do we want to

297
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
privilege larger systems

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
smaller systems how do we give each

299
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
player in the system it's due respect

300
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
and where does that fit in with this

301
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,160
vocabulary of privileging one level of

302
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,719
analysis

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
you know i was i was wondering whether

304
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,360
that's where that active

305
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,519
um dynamic kind of um structure

306
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
that's most that that's a play might

307
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
come in i was thinking that there's this

308
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
the sense that you've got kind of the

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
the overall kind of dynamics of the

310
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
system but there are key places

311
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
where um there there's something i think

312
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
shannon mentioned this

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
last week in terms of the certain levels

314
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
which are most relevant

315
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,200
in terms of um how the dynamics are

316
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
yielding some systemic

317
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,519
kind of act which is appropriate at the

318
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,360
particular spatial

319
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
temporal um sort of speeds

320
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
or distances which are relevant for the

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
study or the experiment or the practice

322
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,839
which is being looked at so i suppose

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,040
in some ways you have to start to come

324
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
back from the other directions at some

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
point

326
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
um assuming you're moving more and more

327
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
towards practice and say okay what's the

328
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
what is it that the the kind of

329
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,440
intentionality of the researchers

330
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,279
cool and we'll return to this idea about

331
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
are we looking at the dynamics at the

332
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
causal structure of the system are those

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
the same thing

334
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
here we're gonna talk for a little bit

335
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
about

336
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
the big philosophical question which is

337
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,639
internalism versus

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
externalism so i'll start with just a

339
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,920
definition of the topic from

340
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,399
encyclopedia.com

341
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
and here it's about epistemology but

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
there's analogous

343
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
dichotomies in other areas they write

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,079
internalism in epistemology is a thesis

345
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,120
about the nature of

346
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
epistemic normativity or the sort of

347
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,040
normativity that is involved in the

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
evaluation of cognition

349
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
specifically internalists claim that the

350
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
epistemically normative status of a

351
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
belief is entirely determined by factors

352
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,680
that are

353
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
relevantly internal to the believer's

354
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
perspective on things perhaps

355
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,200
skull bound as shannon said by contrast

356
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
externalists in epistemology deny this

357
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
the externalist says that the epidemic

358
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
status of a belief is not entirely

359
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
determined by factors that are

360
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,560
internal to the believer's perspective

361
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,959
and

362
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,160
that uh with the spy versus spy

363
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,079
to represent that they're sort of um

364
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,360
playing off of each other they don't

365
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,399
totally disagree

366
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,680
these two viewpoints uh we can see

367
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,880
with this graphic from a 2010 paper

368
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,160
by lynnae and steiner they represented

369
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
in externalism and internalism and

370
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
i just thought this was an interesting

371
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
figure because

372
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
it showed to what extent

373
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
these two schools of thoughts basically

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
agree they basically agree that there is

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
an organism

376
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
that is part of a coupling device like

377
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,000
the body let's just say

378
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
and through actions there's action on

379
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
the environment the environment

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
provides sensations to the organism and

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
that's the action perception loop

382
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
so that's sort of what we agree on

383
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,639
between these two

384
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,440
sides where is there disagreement well

385
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,079
the two

386
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
main things on this figure where we can

387
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
see disagreement are first off

388
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,399
what the externalist sees is happening

389
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,560
inside of the organism to a large extent

390
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
is strategy whereas the internalist

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
sees the organism as making

392
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
representations about the world

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
and then another difference that's

394
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
reflected on this figure

395
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
is that perception the wavy line is

396
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,240
in the internalist's view inside of the

397
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
organism

398
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
it's skull bound it's happening

399
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
downstream of the representation

400
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
whereas for the externalist the

401
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,839
perception

402
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,560
is coming from the interaction between

403
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
the organisms strategies

404
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
and the environmental causality and that

405
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,720
was something i was sort of just

406
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
thinking well

407
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
doesn't perception still happen inside

408
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
even if there's an important role for

409
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
perceptions outside

410
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
and so just looking at this graphic or

411
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
just thinking about where you stand at

412
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,680
this moment

413
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
would you say that you're an internalist

414
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
and or an externalist

415
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
just looking at these graphics does one

416
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,839
of them

417
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
seem more or less consonant with your

418
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,639
stance on how ecologically embedded

419
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,279
systems

420
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
are in the world uh or

421
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,720
does there seem to be something that's

422
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,839
missing from one of these sides or the

423
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,480
other

424
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
if and or is a real choice and we can

425
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,759
pick and

426
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,120
then definitely have you both what what

427
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
makes you want to take and in this

428
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
divide

429
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,880
um um

430
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,000
i feel like i want to answer that

431
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
question at the end of our discussion

432
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,480
perfect i i might as well it's why i

433
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
threw in the and

434
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
and why the spy versus spy are shaking

435
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
hands because

436
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,360
the whole topic and the discussion in

437
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
some senses is uh remember we're moving

438
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:09,920
beyond

439
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
internalism and externalism this may or

440
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,519
may not be

441
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
a false dichotomy and then the question

442
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,519
would be well

443
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
why has this false dichotomy if it is

444
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
attracted so much attention or tension

445
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
what is going to be the framework that

446
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
is going to step beyond

447
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
internalism and externalism and

448
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
potentially provide a satisfying

449
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
resolution to all of the similarities

450
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,160
and the differences

451
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
that these two models present with so

452
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,320
again the action perception

453
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,920
loop doesn't seem like there's broad

454
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,759
disagreement on those topics

455
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
however there seems to be a few key

456
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,959
issues that are

457
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
up for debate such as whether perception

458
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
happens

459
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
purely internally or whether perception

460
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
is related to feedback with the

461
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,399
environment

462
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
and then whether what organisms are

463
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
doing is best thought of as

464
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
representational or as strategic

465
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
stephen i think also those diagrams

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,319
there is also that

467
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
piece in the diagram where they kind of

468
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,359
make out that they're directly

469
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,199
causality and the environment they've

470
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,119
got a direct relationship to

471
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,199
you know like because in some ways you

472
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
your actions

473
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,880
you could if we see that as really

474
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
you've got access to your proprioceptive

475
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
signals and your sensations are kind of

476
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,799
your kind of ongoing stream of data that

477
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,000
that that link to the environment i'd

478
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
say is a lot

479
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,120
um less i think both of these two

480
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,640
approaches rely on there being quite a

481
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
an idea that my action is touching the

482
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
environment as opposed to my action

483
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
being

484
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,679
a kind of set of proprioceptive signals

485
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,880
which i sort of

486
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
am inferring something from and my

487
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,559
sensations are the environment

488
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
you know this idea that i see the world

489
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
as opposed to

490
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
having to piece together a whole load of

491
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,240
non-linear data over time so i suppose

492
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
there is a kind of maybe a challenge to

493
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
that part

494
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,919
of the um of the two

495
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,440
ways of looking at externalism and

496
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,280
internalism that's been done in the past

497
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,720
shannon i suppose um

498
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
that's true too so you said like there's

499
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
a sense in which i touched the world

500
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,120
on stephen and i think

501
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,000
phenomenologically there's a sense that

502
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
i touch and i experience the world

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
but if i'm thinking about the brain the

504
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,919
thing that the neuron

505
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,200
perceives is not the world it's it's

506
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
the signals that have been translated

507
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
into electrical

508
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
and chemical impulses and that's where

509
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,679
like

510
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
i really want to know how the brain

511
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
works i got to be internalist about it

512
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
but if i want to know how i experience

513
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,559
the world

514
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,039
then there's a lot more externalism that

515
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,679
you can allow in

516
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,720
good points and also we'll return later

517
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
on in the conversation too what kind of

518
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
experiments

519
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
would be uh differentiating how will we

520
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
reduce our uncertainty about the

521
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,039
strengths and weaknesses of these two

522
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
options maxwell um i just want to point

523
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,760
out that our agenda

524
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
in this paper was sort of to dispel the

525
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
isms

526
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
of internal and externalism right um

527
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
so i mean the idea is sort of that well

528
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
cognitive science for most of its uh you

529
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
know from its inception to basically the

530
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
heuristically like the late 80s uh was

531
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
an internalist

532
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
uh program and then externalist

533
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
approaches started

534
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,039
appearing in the uh late 80s and 90s

535
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,720
you know that emphasize things like

536
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
embodiment you know the fact that

537
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
cognition is uh grounded

538
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
in the operations of a body um

539
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
you know and then you saw the appearance

540
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
of theses in philosophy like the

541
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,039
extended mind

542
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,520
thesis or the extended cognition thesis

543
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
which is a strong metaphysical claim

544
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,559
that says well actually the

545
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,760
the realizers of cognitive processes

546
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,720
uh spill over into the environment so

547
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
that if you're going to draw a boundary

548
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,159
around the cognitive system you have to

549
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,039
include

550
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
external components environmental

551
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
components as realizers of these

552
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
processes

553
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
and the kind of hard line externalist

554
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
position is basically kind of the

555
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
traditional inactivist position is the

556
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,120
equal partners principle

557
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
which essentially says cognition is

558
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,280
always

559
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,039
necessarily a loop between

560
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,679
uh you know internal structures like the

561
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,640
brain

562
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
and action and external structures uh

563
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
like you know the ones in the

564
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
environment that we're interacting with

565
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,520
and uh our view on that was that um

566
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
any essentialist position about the

567
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
boundaries of cognition which which is

568
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
to say any position that says okay well

569
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
we can define a necessary and sufficient

570
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
set of conditions

571
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
such that we can identify whether this

572
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,760
or that

573
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,919
you know is a bit of cognition and

574
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,600
whether it's internal or external to

575
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
some you know the organism's boundary

576
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
that any essentialist position

577
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
of that sort um is going to be

578
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
wrong-headed

579
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
that there's not kind of a

580
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,919
one-size-fits-all way to

581
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
cut up systems so basically we're making

582
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,200
two kind of

583
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
ontological claims about the boundaries

584
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,240
of cognition

585
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
uh which is that they're multiple and

586
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
that they're nested

587
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,000
um so you know they're they're multiple

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,679
in the sense that depending on your

589
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
uh what you want to explain then the

590
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,360
relevant boundaries uh might be

591
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
around you know a cluster of cells in

592
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
the brain or it might be the brain

593
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
itself or some region of the brain or

594
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
maybe it's the brain body system

595
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
or maybe you know so it depends um

596
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,240
and then the the epistemological point

597
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
which is precisely that it depends on

598
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
our explanatory interests

599
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,520
um so you know it may be that um

600
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
if you want to explain for example

601
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
daydreaming or some other

602
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,640
uh kind of phenomenon well you're mostly

603
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,559
going to be appealing to brain processes

604
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,919
but if you want to explain sport

605
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,200
performance then

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
this loop thing is going to be the most

607
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
important and importantly

608
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
the the the point of the article is that

609
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,080
uh

610
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
the free energy principle gives us

611
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,120
reason to think that

612
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,559
we shouldn't take these strong

613
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,080
essentialist positions

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,159
uh that there's a way around them in a

615
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
way of being more ecumenical and

616
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
flexible about

617
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,480
where we situate these boundaries very

618
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
nice i

619
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
agree and hopefully that's where this

620
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,320
discussion will

621
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,280
take people is beyond the dogma towards

622
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
the specifics of the situation and i

623
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,440
i also was thinking about like dreaming

624
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,799
versus action

625
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,919
uh are these uh internalist versus

626
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
externalist stances challenged by

627
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,039
action list experience like a dream or

628
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,640
is a dream are they going to couch that

629
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,080
as some type of experience and

630
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
you know what enough with that let's

631
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,559
just look for a framework that will help

632
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,919
us deal with the specifics of the

633
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,120
situation

634
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,080
so speaking of internal and external and

635
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,280
how they're treated

636
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
under the free energy principle let's

637
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
talk a little bit about

638
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,280
markov blankets so three kinds of markov

639
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,080
blankets are

640
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,600
shown on this slide there's a quote in

641
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
the paper that

642
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
the markov blankets are a result of the

643
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
system's dynamics

644
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,640
and two twin questions that i wanted to

645
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
raise and think about were what if we

646
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
compare two systems that have the same

647
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
components but different dynamics and

648
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
the sort of inverse of that question

649
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,120
which is

650
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,039
two systems that have different

651
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
components but the same

652
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
dynamics and so especially if we think

653
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,679
about

654
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,799
the the markov uh boundary

655
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,919
shielding internal states so black box

656
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,720
around some

657
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,159
level of analysis all we're able to see

658
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,760
are the emitted states

659
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
so the dynamics of the emitted states

660
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,039
may be similar

661
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,480
even though there's two different

662
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
underlying realities so two different

663
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
computers different hardware but then

664
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
they're able to run the same program

665
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
at the same speed and then the

666
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
other side of the question would be okay

667
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,360
you can have the same computer with the

668
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,080
same

669
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
underlying component tree but then it

670
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,400
might be

671
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
involved in multiple different kinds of

672
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
dynamics so

673
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
how does that fit with the markov

674
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,159
blanket

675
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
what what is the markov blanket really

676
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,840
tracking is it tracking the

677
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
inputs and the outputs of the objective

678
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
system is it tracking

679
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
the inputs and the outputs of us

680
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,720
measuring the system

681
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
well so one thing to highlight just

682
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,840
before we

683
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
we really get started is that i think

684
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,440
too much emphasis has been placed on the

685
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
literature in part i mean in my own work

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,919
also

687
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,360
on the markov blanket on its own uh

688
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,559
markov blankets are very common

689
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,360
and explanatory uninteresting just on

690
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,799
their own for the most part

691
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,960
uh so i mean a markov blanket you have a

692
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
set of random variables

693
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,320
uh you wanna see whether uh you know

694
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,400
this and that one are uh independent

695
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
uh well the markov blanket is the set of

696
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,960
random variables that renders them

697
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,080
independent

698
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,120
uh in the sense that uh

699
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,720
basically they're uh

700
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
that conditioned on the existence of

701
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,559
this

702
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,520
other set of variables then uh these two

703
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,159
uh

704
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,720
are statistically independent um in

705
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
terms of like their

706
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,120
yeah so uh that's cool

707
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
but there are markup blankets everywhere

708
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
right so you can think of like the

709
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,480
present as a markup blanket between the

710
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
past and the future for example

711
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,039
uh it's a very general thing um

712
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,440
in the context uh that we're talking

713
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,480
here

714
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,039
uh the markov blankets like get their

715
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
explanatory purchase when you combine it

716
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,240
with uh the other kind of moving parts

717
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
of the free energy principle

718
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
formalism which are the non-equilibrium

719
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
steady state slash

720
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,120
generative model thing so basically the

721
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,240
markov blanket

722
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,080
tells you which set of states

723
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
kind of belong to the system and which

724
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
don't

725
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
and then the non-equilibrium

726
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
steady-state density tells you well

727
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,039
what is the basically like the the set

728
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
of correlated values that these states

729
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,720
can have

730
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
uh such that the phenotype is maintained

731
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,080
and it's the two together

732
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,000
that really get you the explanatory

733
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
power of the free energy principle

734
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,039
sort of like where the system is and

735
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,440
what it is with the where kind of

736
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,559
answered by

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,000
the markov blanket thing um and the what

738
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
answered by uh the generative model uh

739
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,520
aspect of it um yeah and

740
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,960
so the markov blanket itself uh

741
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,039
in the free energy principle stuff you

742
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,159
get it from a

743
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
sparsity constraints on the flow so

744
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
basically this means like

745
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,000
i know it sounds technical but it

746
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
basically means that all of the states

747
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,039
of the system are flowing

748
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,200
right they're changing dynamically

749
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
they're moving around

750
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
in in the state space the system is

751
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
moving around in its state space

752
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,640
and uh basically when we say sparsity

753
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
conditions on the flow

754
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,679
it's that some variables don't affect

755
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,880
the the change of other variables so

756
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,360
that

757
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,919
uh you know the rate of change of one

758
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,960
variable

759
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,679
with respect to uh some other set of

760
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
variables is a relevant kind of way of

761
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,480
measuring the

762
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
influence of one set of variables on on

763
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,320
another

764
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
and i mean if if the general idea is if

765
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,240
conditioned on some set of variables

766
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,279
uh the rate of change of one

767
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,240
um one variable relative to the other is

768
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,200
zero

769
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,799
then you can say that there is an

770
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,720
independence statistically

771
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
right so the way that the blankets are

772
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,159
constructed is by

773
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
analyzing uh the dependencies structure

774
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,919
of the flow and then saying okay well

775
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
the dynamics themselves seem to carve

776
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,440
out

777
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,640
these kind of independencies

778
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,799
so it's a dynamical notion and i'm

779
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,559
emphasizing that because the dynamics

780
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
themselves are premised on the whole

781
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,399
generative model

782
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,159
aspect of it so it all kind of moves

783
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,600
together and

784
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,120
yeah and you don't get the free energy

785
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,760
stuff just out of more call blankets

786
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,039
shannon yeah um

787
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,559
like following up on that i think

788
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,480
there's a way to

789
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
rephrase these two questions and that

790
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
the first question

791
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
comparing systems with the same

792
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,919
components but different dynamics

793
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
um is asking sort of how

794
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
the same set of components if you give

795
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
them a different set of initial

796
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,399
conditions can exhibit completely

797
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,720
different behaviors

798
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,480
or like come to embody different

799
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
phenotypes in a certain niche and then

800
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,679
the second question

801
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,960
what if they have different components

802
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,279
but they have the same dynamics

803
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,520
is a question of multiple realizability

804
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
where you could have the same sort of

805
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,840
um computation or something enacted with

806
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,279
different components

807
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,360
and these questions together i think

808
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,399
highlight

809
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,520
the importance of um if you have

810
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
this markov blanket over time this sort

811
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
of like system of interest over time

812
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,880
the importance of the way that system is

813
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,840
structured

814
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,880
and the function between um we could say

815
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
the different nodes

816
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,799
underneath the markup blanket um and

817
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,919
that's more important than the actual

818
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,440
physical stuff it's made out of

819
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,919
maybe and back to the first question

820
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,960
the role of the environment in

821
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
affecting the internal states of us

822
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
assume

823
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,039
cool thank you and well stated and tied

824
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,159
back to these other

825
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,039
questions about multiple realizations

826
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,000
the

827
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
follow-up question to that was just in

828
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,039
which ways

829
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,039
the blanket is tracking just the the

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,720
pure observations of the system

831
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
versus the causal relationships and you

832
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
gave a great example about how

833
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
depending on the initial conditions that

834
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,240
means that the uh

835
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
the conditional dependencies in the

836
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
systems may be very different

837
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,760
and so in those cases the markov

838
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,120
blankets are different and in some

839
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
senses this is an implication of saying

840
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
that the boundaries of cognition

841
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,440
are context dependent because it

842
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
shouldn't surprise us that

843
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
the markov blanket and we will get to

844
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,799
the generative model and internal states

845
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
soon but it shouldn't surprise us that

846
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,840
the boundaries

847
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,279
change because there's times where the

848
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,200
cognitive process is happening

849
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,120
in different causal ways or different

850
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,399
spatial scales

851
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,480
stephen yeah i think also

852
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
this might be where that challenge with

853
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,399
the the mind and the environment because

854
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,080
we talk about

855
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
what what mental processes or what

856
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,679
environmental

857
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,159
processes but what's the constituents

858
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,200
that are being put together in terms of

859
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,840
like the

860
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,679
morphology or the actual you know am i

861
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,960
engaging my muscles in my hand which

862
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,039
and that has you know the hand is

863
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,080
constructed so it's not just my feeling

864
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,600
of my phenotype

865
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
about how i should act it's not like my

866
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,080
knowing of my phenotype it's like

867
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,120
my actual biological

868
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
engineering is going to enable certain

869
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,120
things to happen

870
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
you know unlike a chimpanzee or

871
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,159
something like that there's certain

872
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,080
things i can just do

873
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,519
so there's this middle bit which um

874
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
you know we're able to adapt and adjust

875
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,919
to our cognition and say what we bring

876
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,399
what

877
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,480
gets brought online between the

878
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,799
environment and the sensor

879
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,880
so that that's the bit that kind of

880
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,919
really

881
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,000
complicates things but obviously seems

882
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,919
to be really relevant by

883
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,559
i think sometimes gets lost when it gets

884
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,360
kind of more theoretical

885
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,799
yep let's look at this very provocative

886
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,919
quote which is in this sense cognitive

887
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,919
science might be understood as the study

888
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,080
of generative models and processes

889
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,919
it is the business of modeling the

890
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,000
correlational or causal structure of

891
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
actions

892
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
and observations of the organism the

893
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,640
generative model then

894
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
is not the vehicle of something like

895
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
content or mutual information

896
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,200
instead it is the tool that we use to

897
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,559
study cognitive systems

898
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,960
as an explanatory model and indeed

899
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
perhaps more speculatively

900
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,760
the guide or path living systems entail

901
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,000
and

902
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
follow to stay alive as control systems

903
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,480
so in both of these quotes there were

904
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,120
some

905
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,679
pretty interesting notions from a

906
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,679
cognitive science perspective

907
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,039
and also it uh hints at this

908
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,080
way that the markov blanket or the

909
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,039
active inference

910
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,559
uh idea it not only is how organisms

911
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,960
are in their environment and so that's

912
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,919
referring to

913
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,399
this path that living systems follow to

914
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,519
stay alive

915
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,039
in other words that that's what the

916
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,399
animals are doing or that's what the

917
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,679
bacteria is doing

918
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
but also it's the tool that we use to

919
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,200
study cognitive systems

920
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
and i thought it was pretty interesting

921
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,279
that it was first and foremost

922
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,919
uh and unambiguously presented as a tool

923
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,840
that we use to study systems

924
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,559
and then perhaps more speculatively it

925
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,120
was

926
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,519
a guide that living systems follow to

927
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,600
stay alive so

928
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,960
yeah i'm curious just about that

929
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
breakdown yeah to give you some context

930
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,440
this

931
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,760
this uh this paper multi-scale

932
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
integration

933
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
um the schrodinger answering

934
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
schrodinger's question

935
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
and a tale of two densities were all

936
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
originally the same paper

937
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,760
uh that we split up into different lumps

938
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,159
uh with anther answering short anger's

939
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
question being the more kind of

940
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,080
theoretical mathematical statement and

941
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,760
then these two other papers being kind

942
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
of philosophical explorations of the

943
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
consequences of all this

944
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,159
um so over the past few months it's

945
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,360
become clearer to me

946
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,399
what's uh going on here

947
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,840
and i have a paper on this now which has

948
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
been published in entropy with yuneshi

949
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
polito and carl fristan it's called is

950
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,039
the free energy principle a formal

951
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
theory of semantics

952
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,320
um and yes is the answer to that

953
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,040
question

954
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,879
um and basically uh i've been playing

955
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,399
around with the idea that there are kind

956
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,719
of two two levels of instrumentalism

957
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
uh that are at play here so

958
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,079
instrumentalism broadly speaking

959
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,879
uh in the philosophy of science is the

960
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,760
view that well

961
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,040
the work of science uh happens by

962
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,239
leveraging scientific models and

963
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,480
getting them to do uh some interesting

964
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,918
explanatory work uh

965
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
explaining the variance in our data and

966
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,040
stuff like that so

967
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,000
uh an instrumentalist would claim that

968
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,280
scientific models

969
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,520
aren't literal descriptions of the

970
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,800
universe but

971
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,159
a kind of useful tool that we as

972
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,879
scientists

973
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,239
use to explain the main causal features

974
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,359
of the phenomena

975
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,359
around us so there's a first level then

976
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,119
that you can be instrumentalist about

977
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,560
the free energy principle and i think

978
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,680
that in you know

979
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
on a good day when i wake up on the

980
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,880
right side of the bed i'm an

981
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,079
instrumentalist about

982
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,119
scientific models uh

983
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,240
you know uh science is about i think

984
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,400
you know comparing models of data with

985
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,160
theoretical and formal models

986
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
ultimately uh and these can be read in a

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
very very large way

988
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,760
um so you know on a bad day i'm a

989
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
realist

990
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,640
or i have a realist bent and i really

991
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
think that these models are getting

992
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
uh you know something like that uh the

993
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
true causal structure of reality but

994
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:36,880
that's

995
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,200
that's i think science scientific hubris

996
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
maybe or whatever

997
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
but anyway so there's this kind of meta

998
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
level uh

999
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,240
this philosophy of science kind of

1000
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,720
instrumentalism

1001
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,960
uh level uh and i think that's there's a

1002
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
debate there

1003
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,720
uh you know you can you can some of my

1004
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,680
uh you know

1005
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
close friends and collaborators think

1006
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
that the fep is finally a literal theory

1007
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,680
of you know how brains uh you know

1008
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,320
process

1009
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
information so it's not just a metaphor

1010
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
or like uh you know an

1011
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
as-if thing but it's really this is how

1012
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
it happens

1013
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,440
all this is independent from what the

1014
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
the the theory the free energy principle

1015
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,880
itself says

1016
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
and so the more controversial claim but

1017
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,960
i think increasingly i think this is the

1018
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,720
only way to really interpret what the

1019
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,000
math does

1020
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,200
like coherently uh what the free energy

1021
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,800
principle

1022
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,079
is in a sense is the statement

1023
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,680
about how organisms are able to exploit

1024
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
use or leverage the statistical

1025
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
structure of their bodies in motion

1026
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
to generate patterns of adaptive

1027
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,359
behavior so from that point of view

1028
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,880
you know regardless of what your

1029
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,480
position is at the meta

1030
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,520
level or the philosophy of science level

1031
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
at the theoretical level what the fep is

1032
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,599
telling you is that organisms are

1033
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,400
exploiting a a model effectively that

1034
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,079
they are

1035
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,720
a statistical model that they embody uh

1036
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,920
in order to generate

1037
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
uh patterns of adaptive behavior so that

1038
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
was the that's to clarify increasingly i

1039
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,839
think that you know

1040
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,839
double instrumentalism i'm all about

1041
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,440
this nested stuff right so

1042
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,119
instrumentalism nested within

1043
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
instrumentalism is probably the right

1044
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,440
way to

1045
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,880
uh to approach these questions but

1046
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,000
uh it definitely for sure at the theory

1047
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,880
level

1048
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,320
the free energy principle is an

1049
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
instrumentalist theory of cognition

1050
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
regardless of whether we're realist

1051
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,760
about the ontology that it might entail

1052
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,839
thanks for that clarification and kind

1053
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,079
of reading between the citations there

1054
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,400
and

1055
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
i also really agree with that it's sort

1056
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,520
of like

1057
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,480
well we've uh tuned into the idea that

1058
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
it really is about

1059
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
our model of the world and about us in

1060
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,800
relationship with the world and now

1061
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
people just say well

1062
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,160
how is the world really and then the

1063
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
free energy principle saying well it's

1064
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
really about the feedback between the

1065
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,440
organism and the environment and then

1066
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,079
we we still want something to pin down

1067
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,720
to

1068
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,520
that's really how it is but that's the

1069
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,640
instrumentalism of

1070
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,960
science is whether you use optimal

1071
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
foraging theory or an economic

1072
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
theory or some other theory that doesn't

1073
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
change what the

1074
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
system is doing the bacteria doesn't

1075
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,040
know doesn't care

1076
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
what version of which theoretical

1077
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,160
framework you're using or

1078
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,680
you know what what papers you you have

1079
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,320
or haven't read it's doing what it does

1080
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
and the free energy principle is saying

1081
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
that what it does is as you had just

1082
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,119
described

1083
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,040
uh leveraging the bodies in motion

1084
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
they'll also have some questions about

1085
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,040
where thought

1086
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,240
fits into that um and that's really it

1087
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,320
it's really us in feedback understanding

1088
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,040
our environment to guide skillful action

1089
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,599
and uh it you can't just cut the loop

1090
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,119
there and say well then what is just

1091
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,560
what is really happening it's really

1092
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,680
what's happening and the real

1093
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
implications of that

1094
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,760
are as you described so if there's no

1095
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,320
other

1096
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
comments on this slide i'm gonna go to

1097
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
this next

1098
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,960
few points about what is internal and

1099
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,240
what is generative so first

1100
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,040
was a very interesting quote in the

1101
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,800
latter part of the paper

1102
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,720
and they wrote first we take issue with

1103
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,520
the claim that

1104
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,359
under the free energy principle the

1105
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
generative model is something

1106
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
internal to the organism so they're

1107
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
dissenting from the opinion that the

1108
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
generative model is something that is

1109
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
merely internal i.e that the generative

1110
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
model comprises neuronal vehicles or any

1111
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,280
other

1112
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
vehicles i guess like cars rather the

1113
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,839
generative model is a mathematical

1114
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,520
construct that explains how the

1115
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,240
quantities

1116
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
embodied by the system's architecture

1117
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
change to transcribe

1118
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
that is update beliefs about the causes

1119
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,280
of the

1120
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,079
system's sensory observation what should

1121
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,000
be at stake in the debate between the

1122
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
internalists and externalists is the

1123
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,359
status of the guess

1124
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,079
that the organism embodies namely the

1125
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,240
posterior beliefs encoded by internal

1126
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,800
states

1127
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,599
and whether this guest does or does not

1128
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,839
constitute the limits of cognition

1129
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,240
understood as the avoidance of surprisal

1130
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,359
or informational

1131
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,119
homeostasis so my question here was

1132
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,359
if the internal states are not

1133
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,119
generative models

1134
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,440
or another way to say if the generative

1135
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,480
model is

1136
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,920
not something that's just internal to

1137
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,319
the organism what are the internal

1138
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,359
states

1139
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,480
um and then the other

1140
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,040
side of that question is well then what

1141
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,839
or where

1142
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,160
is this generative model playing out

1143
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,720
so i i can i can answer that i think

1144
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,240
it's it's a lot simpler than it might

1145
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,839
seem initially so

1146
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160
in machine learning if you have a bunch

1147
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,359
of variables

1148
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,200
uh some of which are hidden some of

1149
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720
which are observable

1150
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
and you write a joint probability

1151
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,880
distribution over all of those variables

1152
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,280
then that joint probability distribution

1153
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,079
or density

1154
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,599
is called age a generative model

1155
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
so it's called generative because uh

1156
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,119
by representing all of the statistical

1157
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,400
relations between

1158
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,319
all the different variables as this big

1159
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,680
joint density

1160
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,880
you're effectively able to generate

1161
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,319
the the outcomes or the data

1162
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,720
that you would expect you know

1163
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,480
contingent on

1164
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,040
these causal relations actually holding

1165
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,920
between

1166
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
all of the different variables uh that

1167
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,960
you're

1168
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,800
talking about so just from a

1169
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
mathematical point of view

1170
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
this joint density is never represented

1171
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,119
explicitly anywhere in the brain

1172
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,720
in the free energy active inference

1173
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
approaches uh

1174
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,760
typically this whole joint density in

1175
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,800
all of these kind of

1176
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
more formal uh models

1177
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
what you'll typically see is like one

1178
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,000
big probability distribution written on

1179
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,319
the

1180
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,960
left hand side of an equation you know p

1181
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,599
over

1182
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,599
all of the states that you're trying to

1183
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
look at often these will be states and

1184
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,640
precisions and

1185
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,040
you know all these things and then is

1186
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,319
equal to

1187
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,560
some big product of likelihood and

1188
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,760
priors

1189
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,560
uh and so what's actually encoded in the

1190
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,520
brain

1191
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,960
uh has to do with these uh likelihood

1192
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,599
likelihoods and priors so the the idea

1193
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,160
is that

1194
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,680
there is a generative model at play

1195
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
but it's only at play in the dynamics

1196
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,680
the generative model is sort of like

1197
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,440
uh the the wave of falling dominoes

1198
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,160
um the wave itself is only present in

1199
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,880
the kind of

1200
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,520
you know motion or dynamics of the

1201
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,839
domino pile falling

1202
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,960
uh yeah so what we're kind of proposing

1203
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,520
here and

1204
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,200
we'll be discussing this a bit more in

1205
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,800
the next week's uh

1206
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
with a tale of two densities the paper

1207
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
which is specifically about this

1208
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,599
but the idea here is what we're what the

1209
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,160
body

1210
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,280
what body states actually encode

1211
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,319
are posterior estimates right

1212
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,680
so uh posterior estimates of the value

1213
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,200
of states like your your body is

1214
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,680
basically your best ongoing guess

1215
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,839
as to what's causing uh your sensory

1216
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,160
states

1217
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,000
and yeah the generative model itself uh

1218
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,760
is sort of like the point of reference

1219
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,440
for the dynamics

1220
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
uh so i mean if you think about it what

1221
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,119
is it this joint probability

1222
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,200
distribution thing

1223
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,640
well it's essentially a kind of surface

1224
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,760
that uh the system is moving

1225
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,160
around over or the descript equivalently

1226
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
that describes the probability of

1227
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,520
finding the system in a given state at

1228
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,200
random if you're just sampling it

1229
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,119
and what it's telling you is the

1230
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,839
allowable covariations between all of

1231
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,880
the values

1232
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,160
of the variables that make up the system

1233
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,319
such that the phenotype is maintained

1234
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,720
so you know uh speaking a bit loosely

1235
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,359
perhaps

1236
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,960
uh this generative model thing just is

1237
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,280
the phenotype of the organism in this

1238
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,880
kind of broad statistical sense of

1239
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,960
harnessing all of the possible

1240
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,000
uh you know combinations of states

1241
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,760
that are compatible with the continued

1242
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
existence of the organism

1243
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,319
um so i mean it's a bit it's a bit um

1244
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,440
it's a bit uh hard to grasp i'll admit

1245
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,920
uh but at least the mathematics of it

1246
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,079
kind of look like that

1247
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,800
thanks for that explanation and it's why

1248
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,000
we're here is to really

1249
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,480
dive into some of these key issues i

1250
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,839
think just

1251
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,720
reflecting on the pieces that um i'm

1252
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,760
taking away from this

1253
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,200
is one is that the free energy principle

1254
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,680
is describing how scientists investigate

1255
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,440
systems or investigators

1256
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,319
of any kind and then um as was put

1257
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,000
perhaps more speculatively

1258
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
is what is actually uh happening in the

1259
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,520
system

1260
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,280
but in some sense that's secondary

1261
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,880
because it's so important

1262
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,960
to be clear about how we're approaching

1263
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,400
the system so instead of saying oh well

1264
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
it's an optimal forager

1265
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,319
it's like no i'm studying the ants

1266
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,400
foraging within an optimal foraging

1267
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,040
framework

1268
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
no one can take that away from me and

1269
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,319
then whether the ant is doing optimal

1270
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,000
foraging or some other thing

1271
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,920
it's almost a secondary question because

1272
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
it's so critical to be clear about our

1273
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,560
perspective

1274
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,079
and then the second piece is this

1275
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,319
internal and external

1276
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,359
debate or whatever it is tension between

1277
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:07,920
those two

1278
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,400
stances is to be clear about where the

1279
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,200
generative model

1280
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,040
and um is and what it is and isn't

1281
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,359
and also it's just a map in territory

1282
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,880
distinction so

1283
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,960
let's look at a few more quotes from

1284
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,720
this paper

1285
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,200
here's a quote the generative model is a

1286
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,640
statistical construct

1287
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,800
aka that means by people that

1288
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,040
transcribes the expected sensory causal

1289
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
regularities in the process

1290
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,440
generating sensory states the generative

1291
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,920
model

1292
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,240
is used to model the set of viable

1293
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,400
phenotypic statistical relations

1294
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,560
such as preferences and action policies

1295
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,000
that must be brought forth by the

1296
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,880
organism in

1297
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
active inference in short a model model

1298
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
of a viable state of being for the

1299
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,359
organism

1300
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,920
through active inference internal states

1301
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,319
are tuned and this tuning changes its

1302
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,520
posterior belief

1303
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,839
and hence the organism's best guess

1304
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,920
about what caused its sensation

1305
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
that usually include its own actions in

1306
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,760
other words a generative model can be

1307
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
used to understand how organisms are

1308
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,280
able to track or infer

1309
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,079
their own behavior and one key part

1310
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,680
there is that the best guess

1311
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,400
doesn't mean the one that's closest to

1312
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,520
reality per se

1313
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,599
it means it's the most action oriented

1314
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,920
or evolutionarily relevant

1315
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
guess so the best guess for a loud noise

1316
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,960
isn't just doing inference on the

1317
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,040
location of the noise or on

1318
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,920
the exact uh type of object that caused

1319
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,319
it

1320
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,400
the best guess when you're doing

1321
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,319
inference on policy

1322
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,640
is actually about how the body should

1323
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,119
change its dynamics

1324
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,240
and then the um

1325
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
question that i raised here is just how

1326
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
does a multi-scale generative model

1327
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,280
work in the brain or in a social group

1328
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,400
and can there be

1329
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,880
a generative model without action or

1330
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,599
behavior

1331
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,079
or external states being influenced so

1332
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:58,720
heavily

1333
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,160
maybe things these are things that we

1334
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,119
can return to later if no one has any

1335
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,520
comments now so yeah stephen

1336
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,680
one thing i'll be interested in is if

1337
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,359
you're looking at someone's generative

1338
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,839
model

1339
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,000
like what's the best place to look at it

1340
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,440
like in a way if i was to look at

1341
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,359
someone's

1342
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,920
physical states and how that's

1343
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,000
compatible with their existence in the

1344
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,280
environment

1345
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,000
is that a good read on their generative

1346
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,480
model

1347
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,640
as much as looking in the brain you know

1348
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,520
like

1349
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,280
if if the states that i'm in constitute

1350
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,520
my generative model's best guess of how

1351
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,760
i should be in the world

1352
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,240
in a way that's a that that is a window

1353
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,839
into

1354
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,359
what my organism level

1355
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,680
cognition is i don't know whether

1356
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,119
thinking is the right term

1357
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,760
oh yeah i i agree with that i think well

1358
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,960
if you look at a lot of the

1359
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
the active inference modeling uh that's

1360
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
based on the partially observable

1361
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,559
markov decision process um you know

1362
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,640
implementation

1363
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
um yeah i mean for the most part it's

1364
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,760
the behavioral modeling framework

1365
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,520
so what you're trying to do when you're

1366
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,280
tuning your generative model is to get

1367
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,520
your behavioral profile to align with

1368
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,160
some

1369
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,359
data that you're generating right so uh

1370
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,599
you know behavior on some kind of

1371
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,119
task of some sort uh yeah and it

1372
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,319
it's the the the connection to the the

1373
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,680
neuro stuff is a bit

1374
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,359
more elaborate uh

1375
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,880
like you know it it we rely on like sort

1376
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,119
of auxiliary hypotheses and other work

1377
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,920
that kind of

1378
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,000
suggests that oh these precisions are

1379
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,280
being estimated here

1380
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,559
these prediction errors are being

1381
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,400
generated here and so on

1382
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,599
so like if you want to you can use a

1383
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,000
fitted

1384
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
generative model to make predictions

1385
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,319
about the kind of neural substrates

1386
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,319
that you would expect to be engaged in

1387
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,760
this or that task

1388
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,280
and that can help guide you know fmri

1389
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,079
and eeg experimental design to kind of

1390
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,280
probe into

1391
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,960
like specific brain regions that you

1392
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,480
think might be involved

1393
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,240
so you get into this kind of circular

1394
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,240
experimental design thing

1395
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,400
if you want to do the brain aspect but

1396
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,079
actually these techniques are

1397
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,640
more easily used for behavioral modeling

1398
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,160
because you don't have to make all these

1399
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,960
assumptions about brain structure

1400
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,760
yeah it's just one comment on there and

1401
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,359
this was clarified by reading

1402
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,319
the spm statistical parametric mapping

1403
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,440
textbook

1404
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,960
the generative models were used

1405
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
extensively to

1406
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,359
rather than just do descriptive

1407
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,280
statistics on the very

1408
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,720
complicated data structure of

1409
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,319
neuroimaging

1410
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,400
what was being done in the spm approach

1411
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
was a generative model of brain states

1412
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,680
was being used

1413
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,680
as a generative model for the data and

1414
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
so again that's that

1415
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,040
instrumentalism of the scientific kind

1416
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
that just from the purely

1417
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,720
statistical like how am i going to write

1418
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,480
this paper perspective

1419
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,160
having a generative model or having the

1420
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
brain regions connected in a generative

1421
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,720
model

1422
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
that generates data given certain

1423
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
hypotheses about how brain regions are

1424
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,680
connected

1425
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,040
that turns out to be a lot more

1426
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,119
tractable to study and it allows you to

1427
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,800
do model comparisons

1428
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,319
in a very very direct way and then

1429
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,480
maybe the activity of what those brain

1430
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,680
regions are doing

1431
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,400
is itself making a generative model a

1432
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
cartesian theater or something like that

1433
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,440
it'd be wild and amazing if true and

1434
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
also wild and amazing if the

1435
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
bold the brain oxygen level dependent

1436
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,200
signal captured that

1437
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,119
but at the very least and again this is

1438
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,640
sort of retreating to the

1439
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,200
the scientific instrumentalism at the

1440
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,720
very least it's a way that we can

1441
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,599
investigate

1442
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,200
the changes in the dynamics of those

1443
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,359
systems and so

1444
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,000
absolutely i mean this is the duality of

1445
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,359
techniques that we use right on the one

1446
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,440
hand there's dynamical causal modeling

1447
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
which as you're pointing out dan doesn't

1448
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,200
assume that the process

1449
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,880
that you're modeling is itself an active

1450
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,240
inference process

1451
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,400
although it could uh so you know this is

1452
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,319
the technique that we use in fmri

1453
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,280
data analysis for example and it's also

1454
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,480
the technique that

1455
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,280
has been used recently by uh carl

1456
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
friston's group to model the spread of

1457
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,400
coronavirus

1458
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,040
uh which you know you could think that

1459
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,079
uh

1460
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,880
you know maybe uh corona itself is an

1461
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,079
active inference

1462
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,000
type thing but you don't need to make

1463
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,119
that assumption

1464
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,520
to use this modeling strategy and try to

1465
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,480
extract

1466
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,000
you know using the what the fmr what the

1467
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,119
corona studies do essentially

1468
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,920
is take a bunch of raw data like uh you

1469
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,960
know raw number

1470
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,480
of uh of infected a raw number of deaths

1471
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,599
from corona

1472
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,040
and use that as data that you're

1473
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,440
essentially trying to uh

1474
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,000
then write a generative model of right

1475
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,480
and fit the generative model to the data

1476
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,280
the time series effectively uh to kind

1477
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:53,520
of

1478
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,160
extract uh the causal structure of the

1479
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,559
disease process in this case that's

1480
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,559
leading to the data that we're uh that

1481
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,079
we're observing

1482
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,079
yeah active inference modeling can be

1483
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,359
combined with this

1484
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,920
but makes the assumption that the agents

1485
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,880
that we're modeling

1486
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,119
are all performing a kind of active

1487
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,400
inference uh

1488
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,440
variational inference thing nice

1489
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,480
stephen i think this also links nicely i

1490
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,760
mean i do a lot of

1491
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,040
uh with spatial cognition and how so we

1492
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
think about oh i see something well i

1493
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,640
see something within this direction

1494
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,240
there's actually a recent paper i saw

1495
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,800
where

1496
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,640
people who've lost their here who are

1497
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,160
deaf basically

1498
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,680
um they're the brain region um

1499
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,000
for the their vision it actually maps

1500
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,200
out wider

1501
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,800
and has less resolution in the middle

1502
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
because they no longer can hear things

1503
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,640
coming in from their sides

1504
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,559
and they can't perceive things by

1505
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,079
listening to something that comes into

1506
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,599
their auditory field so they have to

1507
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,119
expand out

1508
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,319
their visual field and so this this

1509
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,040
this sense of like how we bring in our

1510
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,079
sensorim

1511
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,000
because we can hear all around us but

1512
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,319
only for a certain distance we can see

1513
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,839
a long way but only in a certain

1514
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,520
direction and

1515
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,200
it could somehow there's another page

1516
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,880
heard about but people will touch their

1517
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,319
nose it could be because you're trying

1518
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,079
to think through smell

1519
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,760
it's like you know like you sniff out a

1520
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,880
problem so you've got this kind of like

1521
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,359
the modality like just when you try and

1522
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,680
feel your way into a problem and ground

1523
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,720
yourself

1524
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
you don't ground yourself with your eyes

1525
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,400
right you ground yourself with your

1526
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,599
bottom or whatever it is and um you you

1527
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,640
hear

1528
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,119
the field or you listen to the field or

1529
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:33,760
you

1530
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,480
see the future or you sniff out

1531
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,839
wrongdoing

1532
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,079
or you taste there's a bad taste in my

1533
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,119
mouth

1534
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,440
about so this this is kind of

1535
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,200
interesting because

1536
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,960
these these are kind of mechanisms

1537
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,079
that are kind of just pure sensorim but

1538
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,880
there's also this kind of um

1539
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,680
the way though sensorium relates

1540
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,760
spatially into the environment

1541
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,880
and couple um

1542
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,800
you know what sort of statistical

1543
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,240
parameters are they

1544
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,880
relating to so yeah i thought that kind

1545
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,960
of fits in with what you were saying

1546
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,839
yep thanks for that and just to give one

1547
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,079
last comment on this generative versus a

1548
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,520
descriptive model

1549
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,040
um what reality hands us what the csv

1550
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,119
that it hands the scientist or the

1551
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,680
images that it hands us from our sensory

1552
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,040
observations

1553
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,839
we could go just from the data and just

1554
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,480
identify

1555
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,040
keep on going upstream until we have a

1556
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,400
model of the world

1557
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,160
and that's sort of correlation all the

1558
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,319
way down you can say well it was big

1559
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,839
and red and you can keep on carrying

1560
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,440
that correlation between bigness and

1561
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,079
redness

1562
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,440
but it's always just going to be

1563
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,520
correlational and then the other

1564
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,400
approach

1565
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,720
would be to go this back and forth

1566
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,400
between the observations

1567
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,240
and then an actual generative model

1568
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,000
where let's just say big and red

1569
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,079
cause each other or there's a hidden

1570
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,040
cause that causes big and red to exist

1571
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,720
and then through expectation

1572
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,200
maximization em algorithms or other

1573
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,559
approaches fitting that generative model

1574
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,559
gives us a lot of power and it's very

1575
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,079
computationally tractable

1576
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,440
to fit um the causal relationships

1577
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,559
that could generate the observed data

1578
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,640
and so the expectation maximization

1579
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
algorithm is a good starting point for

1580
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,240
people who want to learn more about this

1581
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,079
in the scientific instrumentalist

1582
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,920
perspective

1583
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,440
for the next um yep alejandra

1584
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,880
oh yeah um i was i was thinking

1585
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,000
um there's

1586
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,839
i don't know how to say the maybe it's

1587
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,680
correct to say a boundary

1588
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,040
between this um autopaetic

1589
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,240
process in thinking in a cell for

1590
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,640
example

1591
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,000
when we can talk about a generative

1592
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,520
model and

1593
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,799
allostasis processes

1594
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,920
on the other sides like

1595
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,040
only homostatic processes

1596
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,160
so when you can

1597
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,599
um like observe a cell and okay this

1598
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,000
this

1599
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,680
this how to poses um

1600
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,960
processes um are

1601
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,720
driven by a generative model or

1602
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,000
they are just like a more reactive

1603
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and homostatic

1604
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,359
i i don't know but i was

1605
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,720
all the week long i was um

1606
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,240
thinking if if there is like a boundary

1607
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,319
or any distinction or

1608
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,280
just to make a an inference about

1609
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,319
metabolic

1610
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,480
changes uh in order to maintain these

1611
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,319
um like desired states or

1612
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,760
just react and compensate them um

1613
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,599
i don't know but i'm quite confused um

1614
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,559
um when taking this autoprojectic uh

1615
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,079
theory about uh

1616
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,799
living things and and then thinking

1617
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:11,520
about

1618
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,119
um generative models inside this

1619
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,799
uh theory so

1620
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,520
i i don't know if i'm i'm clear in i

1621
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:21,839
thought

1622
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,599
i was pretty clear i mean um so i should

1623
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,880
like you know provide the the caveat

1624
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,359
that

1625
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:33,200
uh most inactivists i think

1626
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,920
vehemently disagree with me about this

1627
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,799
uh

1628
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,079
but uh you know my hot take on this

1629
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,119
is that uh the free energy principle

1630
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,319
completely

1631
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,000
uh kind of subsumes

1632
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,400
uh autopoetic and activism meaning that

1633
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,319
everything that an autop and activist

1634
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,400
can do within their framework we can do

1635
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,280
better

1636
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,839
uh and the reason for that is that uh

1637
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,280
well so auto polyesis

1638
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,319
right is self production and my

1639
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,680
understanding at least of this

1640
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,520
for having i consider myself a kind of

1641
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,359
reformed and activist this was like my

1642
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,280
main thing for a while until i

1643
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,280
i stumbled upon the free energy

1644
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,720
principle uh

1645
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,680
so an activist kind of start from the

1646
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,240
idea

1647
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,960
of autopoyesis autonomy and then kind of

1648
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,160
work out

1649
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,280
uh like how it works and uh

1650
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,720
what you can say on the basis of uh

1651
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,079
you know auto polyesters uh

1652
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,280
so the free energy stuff is cool

1653
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,799
i think because it explains to you how

1654
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,520
the autopolyesis gets established to

1655
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,200
begin with

1656
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,559
i mean i haven't written about this but

1657
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,680
i kind of feel like

1658
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,119
like what active inference is doing is

1659
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,319
putting the

1660
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,599
adaptive loop first right rather than

1661
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:53,920
just

1662
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,520
saying hey look there's this markov

1663
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,200
boundary

1664
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
uh you know like an activist would hey

1665
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,760
look there's this autopoetic boundary

1666
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,960
that's kind of producing itself

1667
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
like the active inference framework is

1668
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
asking so what are what what is the set

1669
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,760
of processes that have to be in play

1670
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,079
such that a boundary can be maintained

1671
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,920
over time

1672
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,599
and then the generative model is is

1673
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,040
really just kind of

1674
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,119
it's a probability density over all of

1675
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,160
the states

1676
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,760
that are kind of uh secluded behind the

1677
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,960
markov blanket

1678
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,799
and that that basically tells you okay

1679
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,119
well so what are the values

1680
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,599
of these states behind the blanket that

1681
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,960
are allowable so look at

1682
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,640
a very simple uh example of this is

1683
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,440
uh so let's consider my the boundary of

1684
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,319
my skin

1685
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,079
you know as the kind of organismic

1686
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,359
boundary for a second

1687
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,240
well one of my internal states is core

1688
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,079
body temperature

1689
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,000
and my generative model has a kind of

1690
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,680
normative density

1691
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,200
over this state which says 36.5

1692
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,760
degrees celsius with a very small

1693
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,960
variance

1694
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,839
and uh you know when i'm detecting a

1695
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,359
discrepancy

1696
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,040
from that kind of preferred data point

1697
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,920
i initiate action to bring myself back

1698
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,160
to that preferred data point so you know

1699
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,880
uh it's getting cold now so like you

1700
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,720
know i might put on a parka

1701
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,000
if i'm uh if i'm trending in the the

1702
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,839
kind of negative direction

1703
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,799
uh i mean the point about allostasis and

1704
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,559
homeostasis is interesting i

1705
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,640
i think it's it's it's it's increasingly

1706
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,160
been worked out by people like andrew

1707
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,040
corcoran and

1708
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,400
uh jakob howie uh but i mean like you

1709
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,079
know homeostasis is all about what i

1710
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,599
just said right so you have a preferred

1711
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:40,720
data vector

1712
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,119
and you're trying to uh get yourself as

1713
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,680
close as possible to that data vector

1714
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,640
uh where that data vector is is often

1715
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,640
going to be something like okay well my

1716
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,359
body temperature or whatever uh

1717
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,319
allostasis is about the control of

1718
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,680
that data vector especially in response

1719
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,720
to stress

1720
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,799
and environments that are basically

1721
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,079
frustrating your

1722
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,880
your desire for certain kinds of data

1723
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,359
and

1724
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,160
uh i actually have a paper that we've

1725
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,520
been preparing for like a year

1726
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,760
and something now with uh irena or

1727
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,640
arnaldo

1728
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,760
and uh casper hess and andrew

1729
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,200
uh precisely on uh on this issue

1730
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,559
uh the the paper is about a depression

1731
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,920
as an allostatic

1732
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,880
uh disorder uh so the idea that you know

1733
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,680
if you need to

1734
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,160
continuously uh be involved in an

1735
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,079
allostatic process where you're

1736
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,000
you're always away from your kind of

1737
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,200
default uh

1738
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,319
data distribution that you would prefer

1739
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,920
then it leads to a basically a kind of

1740
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,920
inflammatory condition where you're kind

1741
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,400
of accumulating a chronic

1742
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,160
chronic inflammation effectively from

1743
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,000
having to stay far away from

1744
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,200
your uh preferred kind of homeostatic

1745
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,119
set point

1746
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,319
yeah um just adding

1747
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,000
something about that and thank you

1748
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,440
maxwell actually

1749
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,119
i was well i am now a reform and

1750
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:07,760
activist

1751
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,880
also and thank you for that paper

1752
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,720
the two tail uh densities um

1753
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,280
thank you for reading it a lot yeah yeah

1754
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,400
um

1755
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,760
but um i don't know what you all think

1756
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,760
but um is there still any space

1757
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,839
um to reactive process processes

1758
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,359
without um inference

1759
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,960
maybe i'll spirit to the metabolism of

1760
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,119
uh angle on the reactive and on the

1761
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,400
predictive coding

1762
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,000
uh side or not sorry not predictive

1763
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,760
coding just predictive modeling

1764
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,280
so we can think about like and i just

1765
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,799
quickly

1766
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,920
got the one second response to this is

1767
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,960
like well

1768
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,839
uh inference here just means tuning

1769
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,200
statistical structure

1770
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,720
so it's nothing like uh you know

1771
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,480
that paper a tale of two densities tries

1772
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,160
to make this point i think like

1773
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,400
the the free energy formulation doesn't

1774
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
really it's a bit counterintuitive but

1775
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,079
it doesn't necessarily require you to

1776
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,839
explicitly compute and represent a

1777
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:10,960
prediction error

1778
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
in the way the predictive coding might

1779
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,400
for example uh

1780
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,079
if you look at the math of it the free

1781
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,440
energy only ever

1782
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,520
exists in the dynamics and by that i

1783
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,680
mean the updates

1784
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,720
right like so you really just need a

1785
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,920
target data structure and

1786
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,119
some sensory data and that's enough to

1787
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,640
engage in active inference if you're

1788
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,680
able to compute

1789
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,880
the difference between the two uh yeah

1790
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,720
and then then it's just gradient descent

1791
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,559
like if you have a mechanism that's in

1792
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,599
place

1793
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,440
that can track and keep a like a lid on

1794
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,839
that discrepancy then you're engaging in

1795
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,200
active inference

1796
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,240
uh like it doesn't need to be

1797
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,559
like this explicit kind of computation

1798
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,680
so uh

1799
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,280
you know from that point of view the i i

1800
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,160
i i'm always kind of shocked at the

1801
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,440
response of an activist uh this kind of

1802
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,559
framework because i think it's

1803
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,799
everything that an activist would want

1804
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:07,599
right like

1805
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,440
it's it doesn't involve explicit

1806
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,960
computation uh

1807
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,480
whatever information theoretic

1808
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,160
quantities are involved only exist in

1809
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,520
the dynamics i mean

1810
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,839
you know

1811
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,720
nice um in just that last closing point

1812
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,520
on the metabolism and also to tie it to

1813
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,559
semiotics so a sugar molecule touching

1814
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,079
the tongue

1815
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,400
it's through a receptor which transmits

1816
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,920
through neural signaling

1817
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,880
that sweetness and that might elicit in

1818
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,920
a reactive way

1819
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,559
the secretion of insulin but also

1820
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:41,280
insulin

1821
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,400
gets secreted in advance of a meal as

1822
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,319
well as in a circadian

1823
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,520
rhythmic pattern that is adaptive over

1824
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,160
evolutionary time and so there's this

1825
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,280
meaning making

1826
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,400
of the sensory inputs of the the

1827
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,599
sweetness of sugar

1828
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,160
isn't necessarily related to uh

1829
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,440
impending spike in fact

1830
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,839
artificial sweeteners are example that

1831
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:04,640
the sweet

1832
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,960
taste or the activation of that receptor

1833
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,160
doesn't necessarily

1834
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,640
entail a subsequent increase although in

1835
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,799
our evolved history it did

1836
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,760
and so there's space in that whole

1837
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,520
mechanism with the tongue and with the

1838
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,039
blood sugar and the pancreas

1839
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,440
there's space for reactive integration

1840
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,400
of stimuli

1841
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,880
through semiotics as well as for the

1842
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,079
predictive

1843
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,839
secretion of insulin in advance of a

1844
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,000
meal um i'm going to go

1845
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,680
to the next slide because we're coming

1846
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,039
along pretty nicely

1847
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,799
so here i just found some funny you know

1848
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,720
memes about changing your mind and mind

1849
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,440
over matter

1850
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,799
and stuff and the questions i

1851
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,880
put on here was first with a quote and

1852
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,240
then two questions

1853
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,640
the quote was under the free energy

1854
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,440
principle

1855
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,720
the system's posterior belief is refined

1856
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
or tuned under the generative model

1857
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,920
through a process of

1858
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,920
variational approximate bayesian

1859
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
inference and it becomes a tight bound

1860
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,400
on the true posterior belief it aspires

1861
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:00,880
to

1862
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,920
and so this sort of aspirational way of

1863
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,799
phrasing what

1864
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,480
systems are trying to do it's not just

1865
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,319
that it wants to uh

1866
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,520
change its body temperature to be

1867
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,400
healthy it aspires to it um

1868
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,559
i was wondering what people thought

1869
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,039
about how might these bayesian posterior

1870
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,039
beliefs be related to

1871
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,839
consciously held beliefs or thoughts and

1872
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:22,400
then

1873
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,359
where might variously things like

1874
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,319
affirmations

1875
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,520
meditation education or propaganda

1876
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,960
fit into this so all of these involve

1877
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,319
sensory as well as thought processes

1878
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,680
how do we figure that these bayesian

1879
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,280
beliefs which may or may not be

1880
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,799
consciously held how does that relate

1881
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,480
why can't we just change our mind to

1882
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,920
understanding the free energy principle

1883
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,240
or

1884
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,280
change our mind to be different

1885
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,400
and these memes sort of suggest that it

1886
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,520
is possible

1887
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,359
and there's entire industries built

1888
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,119
around telling people if you

1889
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,720
can change your mind you can change your

1890
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,400
life but

1891
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,559
what actually enables someone to change

1892
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,160
their mind so that they can

1893
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,319
change their life and how should we

1894
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:07,760
think about that in this

1895
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:14,720
multi-scale cognitive framework

1896
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,160
stephen this actually ties quite nicely

1897
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,079
into some of the work

1898
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,599
around mental space psychology um

1899
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,640
because if you've got a metaphor

1900
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,039
like a metaphor can be a construct in a

1901
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:29,839
way

1902
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,000
which is a bit like the body but we have

1903
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,599
like a mental

1904
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,960
model of how things fit together and

1905
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,760
if that metaphor is still the same i can

1906
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,079
update my beliefs fairly quickly right

1907
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,400
i can if i'm still in my kind of like

1908
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,359
scientific

1909
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,599
chemistry paradigm or whatever i can

1910
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,440
update my beliefs the challenge is when

1911
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,480
i have to

1912
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,760
transform or update my paradigm

1913
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,200
and re-integrate into a new

1914
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,319
metaphor so you've got this

1915
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,319
this in the way like you're saying here

1916
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,319
this so this this idea of being able to

1917
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,760
do approximate bayesian influence

1918
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,480
kind of is quite quick and quite easy to

1919
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,280
do

1920
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,160
if you're recalibrating posteriors and

1921
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,839
sensory data and that

1922
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,880
into you know like the sense that like

1923
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,719
we're all working together you know and

1924
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,839
we're all going to try and work this

1925
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,279
team together and then if it shifts to

1926
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,080
being like

1927
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,000
i'm the boss now i've never been a boss

1928
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,080
before suddenly everyone has to do what

1929
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,198
i need to

1930
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,238
tell them now suddenly my whole mental

1931
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,920
model of what it means to be at work has

1932
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,880
shifted

1933
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,960
now that can be something then that i

1934
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,080
have to do like

1935
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,920
doctors you have to learn your practice

1936
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,279
you have to re-learn

1937
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,719
what that means because you have to

1938
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,560
reconfigure

1939
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,880
and then you can start to work at speed

1940
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,319
again so i think this

1941
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,040
this is quite quite a nice way to tie

1942
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,960
that together

1943
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,359
yeah these are really just um thoughts

1944
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,479
to raise we'll

1945
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,560
move on but just i i wondered okay well

1946
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,679
if the body

1947
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,000
is some you know if my arm is aspiring

1948
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,238
to be this length or aspiring to have

1949
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,719
you know this ratio of muscle to fat or

1950
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,238
something like that

1951
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,560
where do our conscious beliefs fit into

1952
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,479
that and are those upstream

1953
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,120
of our phenotype are they downstream are

1954
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,640
they themselves a phenotype

1955
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,120
how do mental states influence our

1956
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,679
physical

1957
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,759
states and action i think it depends

1958
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,000
what you mean by conscious

1959
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,238
what do you mean by conscious also look

1960
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:27,679
if by conscious you mean

1961
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,040
a form of like reflexive access

1962
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,560
uh then what you need there is a kind of

1963
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,359
temporally or parametrically deep

1964
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,040
architecture

1965
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,279
so by that i mean by temporally deep i

1966
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,279
mean that you don't want a

1967
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,198
just a generative model that anticipates

1968
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,040
the next kind of data point that you'll

1969
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:47,359
be

1970
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,198
sensing but you want the generative

1971
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,560
model that's capable of

1972
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,799
entertaining like temporally deep

1973
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,238
counterfactual

1974
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,040
uh like observations contingent on

1975
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,640
courses of action so you might think

1976
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,120
that

1977
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,960
if a system is able to entertain

1978
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,520
you know possible counterfactual futures

1979
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,679
contingent on courses of action

1980
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,440
then it would be more conscious right

1981
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,760
uh than something that couldn't do that

1982
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,560
so uh

1983
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,480
our preferred approach recently is a

1984
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,440
parametric depth we've been exploring

1985
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,360
this since um

1986
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,199
a paper that actually was just accepted

1987
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,440
in neural neural computation

1988
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,719
called deeply felt affect

1989
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,880
and it so in that paper what we do is

1990
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
effectively induce a hierarchical model

1991
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,000
that is able to make inferences about

1992
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,440
its own inferences

1993
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,480
so by that i mean uh this model

1994
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,360
takes as at a second layer of the

1995
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,640
generative model

1996
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,960
it takes as its data for inference like

1997
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,280
its observable states

1998
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,520
the posterior state and precision

1999
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,239
estimations at the lower level

2000
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,199
so from that point of view what these

2001
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,640
systems are able to

2002
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,440
to do is have a rudimentary form of self

2003
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,640
access

2004
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,640
right where they're able not just to

2005
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,159
make inferences about what what's

2006
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,679
causing their data patterns

2007
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,040
but inferences about their own

2008
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,760
inferences and how much they trust them

2009
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,040
and so like from that point of view that

2010
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,960
might also get you slowly closer and

2011
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,000
closer

2012
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,360
uh to something like consciousness

2013
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,320
uh in the access consciousness sense of

2014
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,679
like you know having

2015
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,600
a kind of nested or reflexive access

2016
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,480
to states of your own being if you're

2017
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,000
talking about phenomenal consciousness

2018
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,159
i think all bets are off i have no idea

2019
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:43,600
no idea whatsoever

2020
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,440
uh you know that's a tough one

2021
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,400
it's a it's a it's a very hard problem

2022
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:50,880
yep

2023
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,840
well it's just things to raise let's go

2024
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,239
on

2025
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,360
to up alejandra

2026
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,199
um yeah i was

2027
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,280
reading the this image that if you can

2028
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,880
change your mind you can change your

2029
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
life

2030
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,199
um maybe

2031
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,640
i i can read this sentence the way

2032
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,440
around

2033
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,880
if you can change your life you can

2034
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,520
change your mind in terms

2035
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,840
in this active engagement with

2036
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,760
um with the world so if you want to

2037
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,040
think differently

2038
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,880
behave differently um it's not just a

2039
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,159
desire you have to

2040
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,080
do it so then considering um

2041
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,679
that cognition is relational

2042
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,880
so all these mark of blankets and markov

2043
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,400
blankets of markov blankets

2044
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,400
so going up to your consciousness

2045
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,520
so um by bodily interactions

2046
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,560
i think is the only way you can change

2047
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,199
your mind

2048
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:58,239
and be conscious about it so

2049
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,360
yeah sure sasha

2050
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,040
yeah i uh like that restatement

2051
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,600
of that um that fun phrase if you can

2052
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,120
change your life then you can change

2053
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,920
your mind

2054
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,199
because um that just reminds me

2055
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,280
i i mean the reason we have all these

2056
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,360
sayings is because it is really

2057
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,800
hard to enact behavioral change and um

2058
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,040
it shouldn't be easy to change your mind

2059
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,560
because then you

2060
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,360
wouldn't have learning and memory and

2061
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,400
you wouldn't have these

2062
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,159
patterns that your life depended on um

2063
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,199
and so thinking about uh

2064
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,040
what it means to change your mind or

2065
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,960
update your priors about something

2066
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,760
like if i want to have a different

2067
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,360
lifestyle or

2068
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,600
exercise more or something like that

2069
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,080
it's not just as simple as deciding that

2070
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,239
then you actually have to follow through

2071
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:55,760
and so how to make that loop easier

2072
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,679
to complete going from changing

2073
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,600
your actions to then updating your

2074
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,199
beliefs it's kind of like

2075
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,280
taking it's like starting to take the

2076
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,640
first step before you know which

2077
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,960
direction you're moving in

2078
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,320
shannon i think this also

2079
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,320
brings in um so like vygotsky or psja's

2080
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,000
work where you have

2081
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,280
your cognition scaffolded by an external

2082
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,199
teacher role um and like once

2083
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,560
you're developed you're not a child

2084
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,360
anymore um the scaffolding role

2085
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,480
comes through propaganda or education

2086
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,239
or affirmations that are um put forth by

2087
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:36,719
whatever

2088
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,199
our sociocultural group is or whatever

2089
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,360
our social media algorithms are throwing

2090
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,480
at us

2091
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,239
um and so it's in as much as

2092
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,000
changing your behavior or changing your

2093
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,640
life can change your mind also changing

2094
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,120
the way

2095
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,719
that you interact with the

2096
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,679
particular the particular regime of

2097
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,440
attention like the particular social

2098
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,960
group that you engage with

2099
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,320
or that you are

2100
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,760
nudged to engage with through

2101
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,440
interactions on social media or even

2102
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:07,760
just

2103
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,960
regular news media um all sort of

2104
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,000
like nudge in less uh volitional ways

2105
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,040
your like bayesian posterior beliefs

2106
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,920
in terms of like conscious higher level

2107
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,199
beliefs about

2108
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:24,480
the world

2109
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,199
agreed well said uh it's not enough just

2110
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,040
to say i'm the kind of person who runs

2111
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,840
every morning

2112
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,360
because if you're not running then

2113
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,880
you're gonna be uh

2114
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,120
not having your sensory input aligned

2115
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,920
with your

2116
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,159
even stated beliefs so it takes actually

2117
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:38,960
the action

2118
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,320
to make that connection stephen

2119
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,560
yeah i think this is also like i know if

2120
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,920
anyone's you know when you walk into a

2121
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,840
cathedral it's like if you want someone

2122
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,040
to feel

2123
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,760
a sense of awe and start to take their

2124
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,000
consciousness up to the heavens

2125
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
you know walk into a 400 foot high

2126
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,040
cathedral

2127
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,120
and it will do a lot to you you know and

2128
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,560
so it's the way that

2129
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,480
and it's not necessarily anyone there

2130
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,880
saying you should believe in god

2131
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,239
or not straight away anyway

2132
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,480
yep let's um go through these last few

2133
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,840
slides because we'll also try to get

2134
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,360
that figure in

2135
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,239
so just some brief notes on free energy

2136
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,600
minimization

2137
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,520
a quote from the paper was under the

2138
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,960
free energy principle

2139
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,040
cognition is what the recognition

2140
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,960
density or living system does

2141
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,440
i.e changing to elude surprises and

2142
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,080
maintaining

2143
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,159
informational homeostasis by minimizing

2144
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:35,280
free energy

2145
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,360
and the way one studies cognition so

2146
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,960
there we're again returning to this

2147
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,560
double instrumentalism and we're going

2148
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,440
to return to this

2149
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,199
again in our subsequent weeks

2150
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,560
discussions on a tale of two densities

2151
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,400
and the way one studies cognition i.e

2152
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,640
what the system does is by developing

2153
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,800
simulating and analyzing the possible

2154
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,640
generative models that explain how the

2155
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,400
recognition density of interest the

2156
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,600
system of interest

2157
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,000
changes so as to attain the minimal free

2158
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,960
energy

2159
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,800
the mechanics of belief is the only

2160
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,480
causally relevant aspect of the

2161
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,000
variational free energy

2162
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,920
the free energy may or may not exist

2163
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,440
what is at stake is the causal

2164
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,280
consequences of the action-guiding

2165
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,120
beliefs of organism and groups of

2166
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:13,920
organisms

2167
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,440
which are harnessed and finessed in the

2168
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,440
generative model what matters

2169
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,520
is that organisms are organized such

2170
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,640
that they instantiate

2171
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,880
such a prior to guide their actions and

2172
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,840
it's not a

2173
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,320
accident that organism and organization

2174
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,120
and organ

2175
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,760
are all related and just to show some

2176
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,520
brief images from a very nice

2177
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,880
active inference tutorial um here we can

2178
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,640
see that there's a generative

2179
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,520
process on the top it's a forest i guess

2180
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:39,920
and

2181
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,719
it is moving through true states but

2182
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,159
those true states are

2183
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,239
hidden and so that's whether or not it's

2184
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,199
real that's

2185
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,400
what's happening and observations the o

2186
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,000
are being emitted and that's the

2187
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,159
partially observable markov

2188
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,840
model which we again will return to

2189
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,280
later and then

2190
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,719
what the organism is involved in are uh

2191
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,960
changing its own state through time of

2192
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,719
its generative model with all these

2193
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,480
caveats and richness that we've been

2194
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,440
discussing

2195
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,080
and the actions end up influencing the

2196
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,560
state

2197
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,360
or not and then that in the next time

2198
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:13,760
step

2199
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,520
provides new observations that update

2200
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,520
the model and then just to

2201
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,920
look for a second at where free energy

2202
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,800
fits into this

2203
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,719
so that like in each of our discussions

2204
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,719
we can kind of bridge from

2205
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,120
the experiential components to the

2206
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,280
practice to the scientific theory and a

2207
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,040
little bit of the math

2208
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,600
what is being shown here is that if the

2209
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,640
organism

2210
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,760
wants to be minimizing its surprise

2211
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,920
and maxwell you can fill me in or

2212
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,800
correct here

2213
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,719
if the organism wants to be minimizing

2214
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,199
its surprise which is on the y-axis

2215
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,440
and the less surprising the better given

2216
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,560
a adaptive

2217
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,960
generative model of the world what it

2218
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,080
can actually do

2219
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,640
instead of just on the left side this

2220
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,920
function of expectation

2221
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,800
that's the blue line the way to minimize

2222
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,440
this

2223
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,239
is actually to try minimizing the free

2224
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:02,880
energy

2225
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,320
and the free energy is a lot more

2226
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,000
tractable to compute

2227
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,239
and it turns out that it is strictly

2228
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,400
bounded in a way where by minimizing the

2229
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,280
free energy

2230
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,920
you go quite a long way to minimizing

2231
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,600
your surprise because they're very

2232
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,040
closely related in a mathematical sense

2233
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
well i mean we have to keep in mind that

2234
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,480
what's going on here is that the

2235
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,239
organism is trying to

2236
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:28,239
sample the environment such that

2237
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,320
the new data that it's receiving is

2238
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,400
consistent with its preferences about

2239
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,280
data

2240
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,360
so it's not just a retrospective kind of

2241
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,400
let's try to fit

2242
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,239
a model to this data the it's it's about

2243
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,159
a kind of forward-looking kind of

2244
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,440
sampling

2245
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,640
strategy uh this is why we

2246
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,000
in this other paper that we'll be

2247
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,679
discussing next week we argue that this

2248
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,199
whole framework is inactive

2249
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,400
fundamentally uh yeah and

2250
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,320
basically you can cast any action

2251
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,920
whatsoever

2252
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,640
in terms of you know trying to bring

2253
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,520
about

2254
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,640
a preferred kind of data structure

2255
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,480
uh i mean and if you want to like you

2256
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,679
know wax a little

2257
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,679
philosophical you could even relate this

2258
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,760
to a phenomenology

2259
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,679
i mean you know i i said i have no idea

2260
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:14,880
how it relates

2261
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,400
this active inference stuff relates to

2262
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,280
phenomenology but my suspicion

2263
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,719
this is pure speculation but my

2264
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,800
suspicion is that uh

2265
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,760
phenomenal properties kind of correlate

2266
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,159
with

2267
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,280
the observable states so that it's

2268
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,320
really like the

2269
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
the patterns of observation that you're

2270
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,400
receiving at any time kind of feel like

2271
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,120
something

2272
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,800
and then there's like an interpretation

2273
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,239
of that feeling which is more like the

2274
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,920
access dimension

2275
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,400
um so that that might go some way

2276
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,280
towards

2277
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,239
uh kind of resolving some of these

2278
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,280
issues

2279
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,920
uh yeah from that point of view like the

2280
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
organism is trying to get to the

2281
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,239
phenomenology that it prefers

2282
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,440
uh which i think is kind of amenable to

2283
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,880
you know some some cool like properly

2284
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,120
phenomenological

2285
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,040
kind of accounts of what's going on i

2286
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,120
mean you know dolores makes this point

2287
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,239
um

2288
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,719
and uh i forget which one of these but

2289
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,400
you know like what is desire

2290
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,400
right well desire is the desire for a

2291
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,159
certain constellation of things

2292
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,159
right it's not just like for a thing at

2293
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,239
least in there's this thing like it's

2294
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,080
it's like you know you're you're looking

2295
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,000
for like you're looking to

2296
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,400
inactive inferences you're you're

2297
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,080
looking to sample a data structure

2298
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,760
that's sort of consistent with the way

2299
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,080
of

2300
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,920
being that you are you know uh

2301
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,960
yeah yeah and if you uh people

2302
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,840
want different things and yes agree it's

2303
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,840
a constellation not just obtaining that

2304
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,120
singular object

2305
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,760
stephen yeah i could ask you a quick

2306
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,120
question maxwell i was wondering is

2307
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,960
there like

2308
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,280
a shift from like active inference

2309
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,360
dynamics to

2310
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,120
as a kind of a way of thinking to active

2311
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,639
influences sense making

2312
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,480
like the sense like it's an active

2313
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,840
influence all the way up and sense

2314
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,920
making

2315
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,080
all the way at the organism level or is

2316
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,080
is there a transition when you'd use

2317
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,480
it again it depends whether you mean

2318
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,120
this more kind of explicit sense making

2319
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,199
or this more if by sense making you just

2320
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,400
mean like

2321
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,679
in like interacting intelligently

2322
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,440
and by that i mean like adaptively

2323
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,120
appropriately or whatever

2324
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,639
with an environment then it's all the

2325
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,480
way up and all the way down in effect

2326
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:22,840
like

2327
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,840
cells and you know cells in a body

2328
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,560
and people at a at a dinner table are

2329
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,639
trying to do the same kind of thing

2330
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,520
um i think for the more kind of

2331
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,880
reflexive

2332
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,040
explicit forms of sense-making that

2333
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,520
you're concerned with in your practice

2334
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,440
uh you would need some kind of layered

2335
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,719
system so

2336
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,960
uh sense making in that sense has more

2337
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,960
to do with our narrative stuff that was

2338
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,639
discussed a few weeks ago

2339
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,360
uh it has more to do with creating these

2340
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,040
kind of overarching

2341
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,400
inferential archite structures that make

2342
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,360
sense of your phenomenal flow

2343
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,679
effectively

2344
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,440
yeah actually that makes sense in the

2345
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,679
sense that i've one thing that bugs me

2346
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,040
at the higher levels or

2347
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,880
not higher levels but these is people

2348
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,560
just use the word sense making

2349
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,480
like they're using media at the moment

2350
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,320
to talk about

2351
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
wiki problems and all of this but what

2352
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,840
does sense making mean when it's

2353
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,000
not an actual thing that someone's doing

2354
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,840
so like you either have to say like

2355
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,840
narrative sense making okay i'm taking

2356
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,600
narratives i'm making sense of it

2357
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,199
i am you know tends to just be this word

2358
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,520
now that's become trendy but it

2359
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,440
oh yeah and in fact some inactivists are

2360
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,199
even pushing back on it to say that well

2361
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,800
it doesn't really mean very much

2362
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,920
uh dan hutto and eric meehan have these

2363
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,120
really nice critiques of like the

2364
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,199
sense-making paradigm

2365
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,480
sasha um my follow-up question to that

2366
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:48,880
is

2367
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,080
what isn't sense making oh

2368
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,120
uh well again it depends i guess on how

2369
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,320
uh we want to define it um

2370
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,000
so basically active inference

2371
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,239
describes more specifically the behavior

2372
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,239
of systems that are actually driven

2373
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,360
in some non-trivial way by uh

2374
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,440
like the beliefs that they encode about

2375
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,199
an external environment

2376
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,440
and you might see this as a continuum

2377
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,320
thing but

2378
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,840
i mean there's a sense in which like if

2379
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,320
a rock is trying to predict its

2380
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:20,960
environment

2381
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,760
and act in a way that you know minimizes

2382
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,719
this

2383
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,480
divergence between well it's not a very

2384
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,840
good model right

2385
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,440
i mean it doesn't do very much uh

2386
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,800
so i mean this might be a graded thing

2387
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,400
in the sense that like you know a uh

2388
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,719
like things that are not sense making

2389
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:41,760
are

2390
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,199
things that don't seem to reflect this

2391
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:45,600
kind of

2392
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,040
intelligent you know adaptation

2393
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,880
to the constraints of an environment

2394
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,239
like a rock

2395
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,679
right uh but you know for for

2396
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,840
people like stephen who means something

2397
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,880
very specific

2398
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,400
and i think like more kind of

2399
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
psychological and meaningful and loaded

2400
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,520
uh if that's what we mean by sense

2401
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,440
making then the vast majority of

2402
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,520
what we would call sense making under

2403
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,520
the other other definition doesn't fall

2404
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,159
under it

2405
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:15,040
so like uh you know you really need a

2406
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,960
very specific

2407
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,440
kind of system that's able to do engage

2408
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,960
in a very specific

2409
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,760
form of inference unfortunately i'm

2410
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,960
gonna have to uh

2411
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,040
to leave at this point thanks maxwell

2412
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,639
see you soon thank you very much

2413
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:29,840
everyone this is very fun

2414
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,120
bye yeah steven i thought there

2415
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,480
yeah just um the the

2416
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,400
also there's this sense of sense

2417
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
breaking or sense finding

2418
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,840
so it could be that sense making is is

2419
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,880
okay this is

2420
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,719
and it works makes sense at the the

2421
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,880
shorter time scales okay

2422
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,199
participatory sense making is like this

2423
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,280
ongoing knowing how to act

2424
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,520
but then when you get to these higher

2425
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,320
levels like

2426
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,600
sense making really is more like um

2427
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,159
you've made there's retrospective sense

2428
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,679
making

2429
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,600
which is really what ends up being what

2430
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,760
people think about sense making at scale

2431
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,840
is i how do i make sense of how i should

2432
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,360
have acted

2433
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,000
but if you can get some interest that

2434
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,800
normally is it

2435
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,120
because so that either means someone's

2436
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,639
just doing something habitual

2437
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,320
or tacit knowledge where they're in the

2438
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,320
flow and you're trying to unpack

2439
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,159
the sense making that allowed them to do

2440
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,560
that but that's not accessible

2441
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,400
because you're so in the flow so you

2442
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,440
need to have some form of sense breaking

2443
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,960
where some and then there's a sense

2444
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,719
finding which i would say is more like

2445
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,880
active inference because you're

2446
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,280
re you're more consciously trying to

2447
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,880
repurpose your

2448
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,440
posterior beliefs and your sensory data

2449
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,800
to try and assemble

2450
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,000
some sort of um understanding of

2451
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,040
what's even going on um

2452
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,560
it might be that point of stuttness you

2453
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,480
know they talk about stuckness so

2454
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,760
stuckness is um once you've

2455
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,760
kind you're trying to get to sense

2456
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,239
making but while you're stuck

2457
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,159
um you may need to go off and do a bit

2458
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,000
of foraging um

2459
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,280
so it's interesting cool let's just

2460
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,080
go through these uh last few thoughts

2461
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,199
and then we'll just go to

2462
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,280
figure six because we had talked last

2463
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,880
time about seeing it

2464
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,840
so on this slide we are going to be

2465
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,040
asking

2466
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,800
are there limits on the kind of

2467
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
cognition that we can study as humans

2468
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,360
because

2469
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,040
of our own individual cognitive

2470
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,480
processes and

2471
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,080
where does collective cognition play

2472
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,679
into this

2473
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,679
which systems are we in a position to

2474
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,520
understand and how would we know

2475
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,000
how would we do meta cognition as

2476
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,360
individuals or groups

2477
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,239
about what approaches uh for which

2478
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,840
systems will be valuable

2479
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,320
and then in the future experiments and

2480
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,440
in the implications

2481
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,920
of okay we've moved beyond internalism

2482
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,480
and externalism all these other isms

2483
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,040
what is that going to mean for our

2484
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,560
practice as scientists or as

2485
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,520
investigators of

2486
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,480
cognitive systems and what would be the

2487
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,199
implications

2488
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,880
of knowing i'm just going to raise them

2489
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,639
just so we can get them on there but

2490
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,560
maybe for another time or in the closing

2491
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,679
thoughts

2492
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,000
and then there was this idea in the

2493
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,600
paper

2494
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,520
the relevant boundaries of cognition

2495
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,440
depend on the level being characterized

2496
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,000
and the explanatory interests that guide

2497
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
investigation so we can return to this

2498
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,239
general question where are the relevant

2499
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,040
boundaries for

2500
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,440
cognition and how would we know if we're

2501
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,239
too internal or too external

2502
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,800
and then in the paper they wrote in

2503
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,760
other words

2504
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,600
drawing the bounds of cognition means

2505
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,520
defining the recognition density of the

2506
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,440
system of interest and identifying a

2507
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,360
generative model that explains changes

2508
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,480
in that system

2509
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,480
that follow variational bayesian

2510
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,600
inference

2511
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,080
and i believe it was sasha who asked

2512
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,000
isn't this the same argument

2513
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,040
that is used for holism or reductionism

2514
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,520
for example uh they'll say something

2515
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,080
like

2516
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,600
we'll know when we've gotten to too

2517
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,360
large of a scale of analysis or too

2518
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,280
small of a scale of analysis because our

2519
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,360
model will break or it'll be inadequate

2520
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,639
or intractable

2521
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,000
so how do we get beyond that paradigm of

2522
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,440
we'll know it when we see it or

2523
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,080
can we ever get beyond the paradigm of

2524
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,600
we'll know it when we see it

2525
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,440
guided by a certain framework because we

2526
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,120
are in feedback with our models

2527
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,320
so just things to think about

2528
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,239
and then i think let's just briefly look

2529
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,320
at figure 6 and then have some closing

2530
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,199
thoughts so

2531
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,480
figure one was about mark called

2532
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,480
blankets figure two

2533
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,360
went into the action perception loop and

2534
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,800
introduced some of the equations

2535
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,679
of fep those were unpacked a bit in

2536
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,120
figure two b

2537
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,239
figure 3 was operational closure in

2538
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,360
graphs

2539
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,400
figure 4 was a schematic illustration of

2540
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,040
auto

2541
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,280
catalysis which is like autopoesis for

2542
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,800
metabolism

2543
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,560
figure 5 was that fractal markov blanket

2544
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,400
showing that as you zoom into the

2545
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,400
broccoli you see that it's markov all

2546
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,679
the way down

2547
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,800
and here we are in figure six

2548
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,639
so if anyone wants to have any comments

2549
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,320
on six because we had

2550
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,719
uh said that we were going to uh

2551
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,400
approach it in this discussion

2552
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,320
they can just raise their hand but the

2553
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,679
way i would walk

2554
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,320
through this figure first is by reading

2555
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,679
the caption

2556
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,639
and what the caption suggested was that

2557
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:19,360
it's going to be

2558
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,960
something like a developmental

2559
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,719
morphogenesis scenario

2560
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,040
so these are not naive cells it's really

2561
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,560
important to take that evolutionary

2562
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,840
perspective like

2563
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,360
the organism is a arrangement that's a

2564
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,800
developmental outcome

2565
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,639
that isn't just an arbitrary

2566
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,040
developmental state it's one that has

2567
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,040
lasted through many generations been

2568
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,639
fine-tuned acutely

2569
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,040
so these aren't just naive little cells

2570
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:43,920
wandering around

2571
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,080
spontaneously um coming to this

2572
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,520
arrangement that's shown

2573
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,639
in figure f um

2574
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,719
it's uh rather a very carefully selected

2575
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,639
set of expectations about which

2576
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,400
extracellular target signals

2577
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,880
like diffusible morphogens the cell

2578
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,120
expects to see and so it knows that if

2579
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,280
it just pursues its expectation

2580
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,000
of the target signal extracellularly it

2581
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,639
will be

2582
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,280
taking part of a larger developmental

2583
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:11,840
outcome

2584
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,080
that is evolutionarily adapted so the

2585
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,719
cell doesn't need to have a cognitive

2586
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:17,360
awareness of that

2587
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,960
but we can think about this like an

2588
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,600
anterior to posterior gradient of some

2589
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,000
diffusible morphogen and what's

2590
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,159
happening each of these traces

2591
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,280
on figure a and b and c are

2592
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,400
through time on the x-axis showing

2593
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,840
like what one cell ends up experiencing

2594
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,120
whether it's it's expectation of a uh

2595
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,120
morphogen again that's the sensory input

2596
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,320
in this model

2597
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,880
or its action reflected by its ability

2598
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,239
to move

2599
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:49,520
then in figure d we see the

2600
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,880
free energy of the system first slightly

2601
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,360
rise

2602
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,520
but then immediately start converging

2603
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,120
down down down down down

2604
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,040
which reflects overall that there's an

2605
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,719
increased precision

2606
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,040
in the ensemble in the aggregate of

2607
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,639
these cells as they sort of

2608
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:07,199
jostle into place and come into an

2609
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,000
arrangement

2610
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,800
that minimizes their surprise about what

2611
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,560
extracellular target signal they should

2612
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
be perceiving

2613
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,320
and what we see is that even though

2614
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,880
there's no higher level coordination per

2615
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,679
se

2616
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,040
the agents end up converging on this

2617
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,800
solution that reflects the target

2618
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,960
morphology in this case it looks like

2619
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,719
i don't know kind of a upside down light

2620
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,560
bulb or something not sure what shape

2621
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,520
that would be

2622
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,120
but you can see how each of these

2623
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,040
different colored cells

2624
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,159
is able to be uniquely determining where

2625
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,800
its position is like the green cell it

2626
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,560
can be thinking something like

2627
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,040
i want to be close to blue but far from

2628
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,679
yellow and

2629
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,239
totally far from red the blue cell might

2630
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,360
be thinking something like

2631
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,280
i want to have an intermediate level of

2632
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,120
the green and the yellow signal

2633
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,280
and then the red cells might be thinking

2634
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,159
something like

2635
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,560
i want to have mostly red signal and

2636
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,000
then in decreasing order

2637
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,120
yellow blue green and then depending on

2638
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,280
what the instantaneous perception is of

2639
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,120
those diffusible morphogens

2640
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,239
the cells can either update their

2641
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:11,520
generative model of the world

2642
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,120
through movement that's the

2643
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,800
morphogenesis component

2644
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,639
or by changing their generative model

2645
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,320
which isn't actually happening like

2646
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,000
there's no learning and adaptation

2647
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,360
within this model

2648
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,480
but over evolutionary time it will end

2649
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,440
up being the case

2650
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,679
that developmental trajectories that

2651
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:28,960
robustly enable

2652
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,440
high fitness morphologies to arise will

2653
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,719
be selected for

2654
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,440
so that's sort of my short take on

2655
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,560
figure six any

2656
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,840
comments or thoughts on that

2657
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,639
cool just because we're basically out of

2658
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:43,840
time um

2659
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,639
i'll just say thanks everyone for

2660
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,400
participating and we'll have a closing

2661
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,920
thought as well

2662
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,840
we're going to provide a follow-up form

2663
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,440
for our live participants i'll put that

2664
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,280
in the chat in a second

2665
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,159
we request feedback suggestion and

2666
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,199
questions from

2667
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,840
all of our viewers and our participants

2668
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,400
and

2669
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,840
we just hope that people stay in

2670
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,159
communication with us and keep watching

2671
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:07,840
next week and the following week we're

2672
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,080
going to be talking about a tale of two

2673
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:10,880
densities

2674
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,480
which is the paper that we mentioned a

2675
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,920
few times today

2676
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,360
and yeah it's going to be a great

2677
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,520
discussion next two weeks as well

2678
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,239
so if anyone has any closing thoughts on

2679
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,040
the discussion

2680
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,040
while i post the link in here they're

2681
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:32,080
free to go ahead

2682
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,679
if any thoughts otherwise that was a

2683
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:39,120
great discussion cool yeah

2684
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,880
thank you for the discussion that was

2685
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,719
great awesome

2686
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,880
in that case i am going to

2687
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,400
terminate the live stream thanks

2688
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,480
