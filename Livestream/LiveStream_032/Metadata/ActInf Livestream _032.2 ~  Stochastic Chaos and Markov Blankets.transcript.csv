"Speaker 1","00;00;36;18","00;01;05;18","Hello, everyone. Welcome to act in flight to active flab live streamed number 32.2. It's November 16th. 2021 Welcome to the acting lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us some of the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;06;13","00;01;32;15","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good and fun video etiquette for livestreams at this short link, you can see some of the upcoming streams. This is our second participatory group discussion on the stochastic Chaos and Markup Blankets Paper and then in the second two weeks of November, we're going to be discussing Thinking Like a State by our friend and co participant, Adele."
"Speaker 1","00;01;33;01","00;01;59;15","And we haven't yet set the papers for December. So if you know an author who you'd like to invite, or if you yourself would like to join for several weeks of discussion of one of your works, then just let us know today in active stream number 32.2, we're aiming to learn and discuss and ask what if and what is and hold all these different questions at once."
"Speaker 1","00;02;00;13","00;02;27;24","We're in the second participatory discussion around the paper Stochastic Chaos and Markov blankets by Kristen Hinds or Topher de Costa in PA. And last week we had an awesome discussion in the Dark One, and we got right up to the cliffhanger where the the M-word actually was deployed. And I think today we're going to sprint up to that cliff and then jump off."
"Speaker 1","00;02;28;01","00;02;54;21","So it'll be a fun discussion for those who are watching live. Totally write questions and comments in the live chat and Stephen and Dean and I and anyone else who joins will be just more than happy to hear what you have to share and to roll with it as you write. Thanks. So let's begin just by giving a introduction or warm up so we can say hello."
"Speaker 1","00;02;54;21","00;03;24;01","And then also just maybe what was exciting about the paper overall or since we all participated in the DART one, what are you looking forward to in the two or maybe how have you changed how you thought about it over the previous week? So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll say what I'm excited for until a little bit later and I'll pass it to Dean Hey."
"Speaker 2","00;03;24;01","00;03;47;22","Good morning. My name is Dean. I'm in Calgary in the in the one week's time since we left off, I, I think this paper, more than many of the other people we've had conferences throughout, breathes life into something that is typically perceived as not very alive. It's just, it's just a sort of a point to and an explanation of."
"Speaker 2","00;03;47;22","00;04;08;12","But I think this is one of those papers where when people pick it up and start having conversation with one another about the kind of work that's being done here, it makes it really, really interesting. Doesn't give us necessarily the answers that the authors could project would be given. And I really like that."
"Speaker 1","00;04;09;26","00;04;11;01","Thank you, Dean. Stephen, I'll."
"Speaker 2","00;04;11;01","00;04;11;26","Pass it to Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;04;13;27","00;04;50;05","Yeah. Good morning as well from Toronto. I I'm really interested in this paper, I think, because it does give a unifying perspective. It does help with that unified perspective, even though at first when you see things like stochastic chaos, it can be like, Oh, we're going down another rabbit hole, et cetera, et cetera. But actually, rather than always justifying or talking about applied activity through inference, through applications and quotient applications, there is some benefit to this kind of coming to the foundation."
"Speaker 3","00;04;50;18","00;05;24;20","So I'm excited by that. And also actually following a conversation we have in Urdu in the fact that we have this complexity weekend is some of the ways that complexity can be talked about outside of a more woo woo kind of conversational sense at these foundational levels, which again seems to get into unnecessary detail. Ultimately, I think it starts to allow some of these crossovers between applications of complexity and this to happen, which for me personally, I don't think I was necessarily able to articulate a year ago."
"Speaker 3","00;05;25;01","00;05;29;26","So I think some of this work does just help fill in some of those gaps."
"Speaker 1","00;05;31;21","00;06;08;04","Thanks. I agree. Like the system that's picked up and turned around and remodeled throughout the course of the paper in a very narrative driven way is the Lauren's attractor, which is like the classic complex systems model. So it just kind of plays into contemporary work on complexity and so many other areas. But and then also, I really like what you said, like the authors I hope will be able to join for a future presentation so we're in contact."
"Speaker 1","00;06;08;04","00;06;41;09","They probably won't join today, but what the authors are putting out there and then how that's received and communicated around and explored, that's what's fun. And I know that will have many cool things to explore today. So let's jump to the big questions, then we'll look at the roadmap and try to remember where we got to yesterday and maybe a different big question is striking either of you or anyone in the live chat today."
"Speaker 1","00;06;41;20","00;07;03;28","And then we'll try to remember how far on our road trip we got last Tuesday and then let's see which sections we're going to get to. And we have a bunch of other things kind of written down. So the big questions that we had previously asked were What is a good model of thinking this in a chaotic, dynamic and disruptive world?"
"Speaker 1","00;07;04;23","00;07;32;04","How might this model or approach to finance speak to system sentiments? And they're in little tiny font. It's sentience, not in the phenomenological like experiential, but greetings of all. Good to see you. But sentience in the setting in the sense of feeling, thinking and feeling systems without worrying about the first person experience side, at least in this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;07;32;22","00;08;00;04","And then the key technical question of this paper, which bridges on to a million and a half other areas, is what is a markup blanket? Just what are these blankets and how is one model identified to find statistically, what are the pros and cons of different approaches? And so that's some of the technical details that we'll get to. So Steven, thanks for raising your hand and then welcome survival after that."
"Speaker 1","00;08;00;04","00;08;05;02","Feel free to say hello and introduce yourself if you'd like yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;08;05;04","00;08;26;08","I'm curious. I notice here that we start with Cygnus, which I do agree is this big question of things. This is something that fixed and brings up quite a lot. But I think he's often he's the he in that part I it is often a bit of a lone voice in terms of really pushing the thing. This side of things and I think is really interesting."
"Speaker 3","00;08;26;08","00;08;49;18","That second question then is, OK, how does that speak to system sentience? And you see now we move into systems right and OK, signals sort of to me, it gives rise to systems and gives rise to sentience. However, I think it's thing is is still their right thing. This is still the game in some ways of being maintained."
"Speaker 3","00;08;49;18","00;09;16;09","So that first question because when we then get into the third question thing, this can get lost and it's all about system sentience. And I think there's something really interesting there because there is a question of I mean, even as we say in those brackets, what it really means to have system sentience or even just system is probably rather ill defined."
"Speaker 3","00;09;16;19","00;09;32;00","And I suppose to some extent is how much is it even needed? How much can things be maintained as an equal partner in the game and not sort of passed over once we scale. So I think that's a good, good piece of a property nation."
"Speaker 1","00;09;33;06","00;09;46;16","Thank you. And to what extent can things and systems be identified in a bottom up way from measurements of dynamical systems? Or survival? Would you like to add anything or say hello or partial."
"Speaker 3","00;09;49;16","00;09;51;10","No, I'm a terrible."
"Speaker 4","00;09;52;17","00;10;13;20","I'm a complexity scientist. I have something in the system or theory which is interested in building an active models of social or political changes. And I'm here to see the discussion around the symbolism of the paper, which I did not revise, and I therefore cannot make informed comments on."
"Speaker 1","00;10;16;07","00;10;18;01","Thank you for Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;10;19;17","00;10;45;25","I just want to add one thing to what Steve was talking about there. I think what the big questions and what this paper addresses pretty directly is can we can we accept a minimum of two, that there's an abstraction and that there's a material aspect to thing this and and and marrying those two things is kind of what we we're hoping to be able to do."
"Speaker 2","00;10;46;10","00;11;10;14","But but it comes in two very discrete forms. So so what of that we call it thing this because it kind of spans both realms. And that's what I think I take away from the idea there can be chaotic and not absolutely."
"Speaker 1","00;11;10;22","00;11;52;01","There's the map in the territory. And one thing that we're going to return to is like the first map that we apply to the territory. So already we're separating the territory in the map, but even the first map can be chaotic. And then can we put a second map, the laplacian approximation, as it turns out in the paper, can that second map be one that gives us some properties that make it more tractable to handle like, you know, potholders taking something hot out of the oven, give a better grip on the first map which gives a better grip in terms of actionable insight into the territory."
"Speaker 1","00;11;52;14","00;12;07;25","Can that second level both be more tractable especially using computers, but also retain those chaotic properties, which we're going to see when they estimate the lyapunov exponent of the proxy, an approximation so."
"Speaker 2","00;12;08;10","00;12;16;21","That's the recursion prior to the the repetitiveness. That's what I think this really gets into recursion modeling."
"Speaker 1","00;12;17;19","00;12;18;19","Thanks, Dean. So, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;12;20;10","00;12;49;17","Yeah, I'm going to go this is maybe a little bit of a question as well. It's rhetorical if it doesn't want to be answered, but I think that the thinness and the mark or blanket because we're getting to that stage here, there is this there's I think there's tends to be a sense that, OK, we have a thing because it's it's trying to sort of maintain itself and it just dissipates if world then it's effectively a system because it's got Mark Blanket in that."
"Speaker 3","00;12;49;18","00;13;33;00","Well, but with this, it's like, well, you've got lumens attractor then the winds attract it goes into this right now and then thing this potentially goes into probably with a few phases system sensing system. So the question is which side of the which side of thing this is mark of blanket this mark or blanket emerge from from going from lumens attractor into thing this and then continue or is it is like lumens attractor into thing this into malkovich and blanketed thing this curious what your thoughts on that and maybe this paper sheds some light on that."
"Speaker 1","00;13;35;00","00;13;59;04","Great question let's look at the roadmap and just see how that comes into play. So we talked in 32.1 about a few different ideas and we have some slides ready with just tabula rasa if we'd like to add notes or we can always modify slides and deal with questions as people are raising them let's go to the roadmap though."
"Speaker 1","00;13;59;11","00;14;37;12","OK, so the roadmap of the paper is as follows. In Section one, there's an introduction in section two, there is from dynamics to densities. So this is one of the really fundamental kind of linking events early in the paper where dynamical systems dynamics are linked to flow systems like densities so this equivalence between dynamical systems and density driven systems is going to be finessed extensively in the paper."
"Speaker 1","00;14;37;20","00;15;08;10","So that's an introductory step that's very important to note. The Helmholtz decomposition is a tool from vector calculus that applies very well to densities and flows where it's usually applied. But because of what links were made in Section two, it becomes possible to take that Helmholtz decomposition approach to dynamical systems that is specifically visited and revisited and then moved beyond in the Lorenz system."
"Speaker 1","00;15;09;03","00;15;56;23","That's one of those classical chaotic systems and a favorite toy of complexity analysis the Lorenzo system is moved beyond and then approximated with a laplacian and then even moved beyond there. So that's pretty much where we got to last week. We tried to do a really solid grounding in first the equivalence between dynamical systems and density driven systems, or two kind of representations of underlying systems that could be seen as equivalent and then we talked about the Lorenzo system and about how it's chaotic and how chaotic means like sensitivity to small changes as quantified by the by the lyapunov exponents."
"Speaker 1","00;15;57;19","00;16;20;00","And then we talked about how the laplacian approximation, which is kind of like fitting a quadratic which is kind of like letting the ball roll to the bottom of the ball. And this idea of like, well, if we can phrase the problem like a ball, then all we have to do is roll to the bottom. There's only one bottom and we know which slope we're on."
"Speaker 1","00;16;20;10","00;16;46;15","So that's also called convex optimization because no matter where you are, if you know that the problem is shaped like a quadratic curve, like a ball, you can just instantaneously estimate the slope of the ball and then just run downhill. Whereas if you're on a rugged landscape, just, you know, you're lost in a mountain region will go downhill, you're going to get trapped into a valley potentially, and you might not make it out to the ocean."
"Speaker 1","00;16;47;05","00;17;16;24","But if you could reimagine that rugged landscape in a way that was more bold like it would allow for tractable estimation of which way to move in section four, we get to the Markov blanket concept and the free energy principle. And I think that's going to be the really fascinating discussion is like, OK, so let's get what that Markov blanket, what is that partitioning?"
"Speaker 1","00;17;16;24","00;17;40;17","What are we really talking about? And then are we talking about the territory or are we talking about the Laurens map or are we talking about the Laplacian map? Where is this blanket partitioning coming into the picture? And then how does that help us reduce our uncertainty about systems and what does it say or not about that underlying system?"
"Speaker 1","00;17;41;01","00;18;21;28","And that's where we're going to be talking about particular partitions. Of course, a favorite and recurrent pun, which is that particular means specific, but also it means like a particle, like a autonomous particle drifting around in space. And then Section five really comes to a culmination with a discussion of the free energy principle alone. And so I think it'll be interesting to discuss like what is subsumed into the free energy principle and why do we need one section and blankets and free energy principle and then another section on just the free energy principle so that's kind of the roadmap."
"Speaker 1","00;18;22;15","00;18;23;23","Steven and Andy."
"Speaker 3","00;18;25;09","00;18;56;09","Yeah. Just a quick question. See if this clarifies something which I think is what you're saying dynamics is the dynamics more particular flow and densities while you could have a density of particles, it's actually more like a probability density on wave functions. Would I be right in thinking this is kind of a wave particle or part actually a particle then wave way into this."
"Speaker 3","00;18;56;09","00;19;01;02","And that's partly how the playing this out."
"Speaker 1","00;19;02;29","00;19;30;16","Someone with more experience with the formalism would be totally open to their contributions. On that question, my first take would be you could make dynamical systems model like equations of motion for a particle floating around. And so it's like you're focusing on the first, second and third derivatives of movements in X, Y, Z space or tetrahedral space for some particle."
"Speaker 1","00;19;30;16","00;19;52;12","So a dynamical system model could be describing the movement of a particle, but the flow that gives rise to the movement of that particle is it's kind of like figure in ground, like the dynamical equation features the movement of that particle. Like I want to know the pendulums location. And so that's going to be a dynamical model of the pendulum."
"Speaker 1","00;19;52;28","00;20;18;04","Whereas the flow based models, like you pointed out, are much more about, well, what is the underlying space of the flow of that pendulum? So it's like if it's to the left of the bottom, it's like it flows this way. And if it's to the right, it's like it flows that way. And so that is about asking what is the underlying flow dynamics that do give rise to movement of potentially particles?"
"Speaker 1","00;20;18;21","00;20;38;09","And those are why this meme is on the slide and why they are made in equivalence early in the paper, because it is like talking about the difference between the movements of a point through a space versus understanding the flow dynamics of that space that yes, does give rise to the movement of particles."
"Speaker 3","00;20;39;15","00;21;03;19","And could I just ask one? So what if almost it goes from a just purely the, you know, the momentum of a particle to this flow and the flow is kind of a bridge then between density dynamics, which is maybe more of a probability density of where it could be, which can map both to an object where an object might be, but also where a wave function might be in broad sense."
"Speaker 3","00;21;03;19","00;21;18;11","So then you're sort of going from literal particles in a classical sense to the flow, and then the flow then bridges into density dynamics, which is can be more probability orientated is that fair to say?"
"Speaker 1","00;21;19;07","00;21;47;26","Yes. Particle is going to take a particular meaning a little bit later. When we talk about the partition ning of states, but I believe that's correct. And also the density, like you suggested, ties much more closely to statistical density distributions. Like in statistics, we're often interested in density distributions of a special type like the area under the distribution summing to one."
"Speaker 1","00;21;47;27","00;22;25;19","The integral over a distribution being one allows us to treat it like a probability distribution. And so that's the whole debate in quantum is it actually a wave, or does that distribution of positional uncertainty merely describe our statistical inference on the location of something that's at a specific point? So whichever side we want to come at this from Section two says it's going to be OK to use both, and we're going to sometimes lean more on our left leg and sometimes we're going to lean more on our right leg because there's tools that exist for one, but not the other."
"Speaker 2","00;22;26;03","00;22;50;04","Dean Yeah. I don't know if this begins to answer Steven's rhetorical question, but I think where most people get introduced to a markup like it, they get introduced to the idea that it's either a way of partitioning and dividing or it's a way of being able to envelop or blanket. And I think what the paper points out is that it's both all the time."
"Speaker 2","00;22;50;04","00;23;14;13","So you could, for example, find a box of cookies and see all the cookies settling at the bottom. Whereas if the person is, you know, described as being creative, uses that box of cookies as a leverage point to get more cookies off the top shelf, now it's a platform and now it's a mound. And so we can see it both ways at once if we think of it as both ways and what's not."
"Speaker 2","00;23;14;13","00;23;34;01","Another question is that minimum of two piece again, that that is really fascinating about this. That really kind of blows people up. It's really both at once. Then you decide which is going to be and that's what I think is really fascinating for people who just sort of start getting into this because they they've been so habituated to saying, oh, it's, it's a cookie jar."
"Speaker 2","00;23;34;20","00;23;38;19","Oh, it's a platform. No, it's both and that's that's what we want to do."
"Speaker 1","00;23;39;19","00;24;01;03","Thanks. Dean and Marco in the chat wrote like a boat in a stormy sea. It moves at the mercy of the seas. And winds flowing forces with only its rudder sails and other limited mechanisms to steward the world's influence on its journey. So buggy meme one Unity is plural at minimum two Bucky Meme two on his gravestone call me trim tab."
"Speaker 1","00;24;01;05","00;24;20;14","Kind of like the rudder. And that is exactly getting at the point of this paper. Which is, if we just were talking about a dust molecule floating in the air, then we could say, well, we could use the dynamical systems model of the position of the dust particle, or we could do inference on the flow of the room."
"Speaker 1","00;24;21;02","00;25;11;18","And that gives us a different and complementary, totally excellent picture but that's a dust molecule. What about active systems that have affordances that are able to do inference on action selection, choose different policies? How do those active systems do inference? That's the winged snowflake, that's the moth to the flame. And those are the really exciting systems. And that also speaks to the difference between what's called mere active inference, like the particle where we can still have this partitioning and still see it as a dynamics or a flow versus the adaptive active inference, which is then we're thinking about those systems where the particle, the particular states are able to effect different policies and select between"
"Speaker 1","00;25;11;18","00;25;20;00","them in a way that acts as if it's resisting dissipation. And those are the kind of exciting systems that we want to get to by the end of the paper."
"Speaker 3","00;25;20;07","00;25;49;14","Stephen And pulling on that idea of the cookie jar is this the cookie jar is maybe almost a particle, a thing that is like leveraged and there's a thing ness which it becomes. So it's a it has a thing about it, but there's a thing ness of being an affordance. So this is an interesting just sort of came to me."
"Speaker 3","00;25;49;14","00;26;19;01","But the thing this in itself is slightly emergent because this only by the process of trying to use it to get the higher cookie does another kind of thing emerge, which becomes a step. So there's something interesting there about the ness as a as an emergent, you know, is it ever a step really? But it's always it's never not a thing at the same time."
"Speaker 3","00;26;19;01","00;26;26;09","So there's a I think there's something quite interesting there in that emergent stroke, flow, stroke in a literal sense."
"Speaker 1","00;26;27;13","00;26;53;21","And also, I don't know to what extent this is intentional but thing this we talk a lot about and assess the non equilibrium steady state or non equilibrium stationary states and so it's like the things ness. That's the thing. The thing we're talking about is the things ness. So we're not talking and saying that the system is at stationary."
"Speaker 1","00;26;54;01","00;27;27;03","We're saying that the things ness by virtue of how we're modeling it has stationary characteristics. And that is the thing as we model it, which is that always existing difference between the map and the territory we're not saying that the territory is even a thing. We're saying the way we're relating and interacting with the map, which we totally made, no one's going to deny that that maps things ness is tractable."
"Speaker 1","00;27;27;03","00;27;31;19","I can hold the map in my hands. That gives me a better grip on my road trip."
"Speaker 3","00;27;32;29","00;28;14;00","Stephen that's a severe. Yeah. I think also the the thing this can tie in to the idea that something ontologically comes into being through relation to some sort of network dynamic in which it acts and that actually that speaks this leavens a tractor, you know, so the lens becomes part of a network of an ontology of thing which is really a thing in relation to what some other thing is like, you know, because obviously the scale of the cookie box is quite a lot different to the scale of the atoms in the cookie box or the whatever scale we want to."
"Speaker 3","00;28;14;10","00;28;44;23","So there's the, and then there's some sort of affordance level and maybe we can get out of the whole sentient system thing and it's like it's just an affordance for the thing this to maintain the thing. This doesn't need to know about systems as such unless someone, some creature happens to evolve a brain which starts to sit down, working out system diagrams, two legged ones potentially, but otherwise it's like it's just things all the way up, right?"
"Speaker 1","00;28;46;28","00;29;31;18","Let's now that were 31 minutes in let's sprints up to that Markov cliff and then see where we go. So figure one of the paper is kind of making this first fundamental connection between the Lorenz system as defined by dynamical equations. So the traditional Lorenz is defined more like the blue version within equations of motion. Well it has a positively opposite exponent, which is to say that very closely located points diverge rather than stay in like a laminar flow parallel line world or converging."
"Speaker 1","00;29;31;27","00;30;06;05","So they diverge and that's what makes Lorenz system chaotic ergo difficult to predict given measurement error and tiny perturbations due to even thermal noise, which is like kind of how pseudo random number generators work. And then there's going to be an approximation based upon this stochastic solution and so the trajectory and the right panel here, it's the deterministic solution to the laplacian form of Lorenz based upon the Helmholtz decomposition."
"Speaker 1","00;30;06;20","00;30;19;03","And so this is sort of like the version on the right that's usually seen in the state space model is almost like we're sampling stochastic li from points along that racetrack. So that was figure one."
"Speaker 3","00;30;19;23","00;30;40;12","We would you just if you just explain that, just go over that one more time. Just to clarify that bit. I think I understand what you're saying, but it's kind of an important point you make there when you say deterministic solution that I didn't there is that window just to clarify what that means."
"Speaker 1","00;30;41;17","00;31;21;26","So the deterministic solution would have no noise so that the position at the following time is entirely determined by the non stochastic state that it's in at the preceding moment. Whereas when we talk about a stochastic form it's like that's like your cars driving and there's thermal vibrations on the road. Now, the lyapunov exponent on that car at non zero temperature is small so that the flow term dominates the vibratory term."
"Speaker 1","00;31;22;08","00;31;44;02","But there could be some other system where the difference between if it's in an absolute zero world and just on the road, then it's going to go straight. But once you introduce any wiggling, when the system is chaotic, it has that positive, the opposite exponent, then the tiniest wiggle causes the system to diverge."
"Speaker 3","00;31;45;21","00;32;12;26","That's really helpful because so basically normally we just like with the deterministic thing, it's just whatever the initial conditions, if it varies slightly, but then once it runs, it will settle into something. But if you you've got the initial condition and you've got the perturbations due to noise as it's actually in which and I suppose you could say a little bit of an extra change in initial conditions to each state that the lens attracts is moving through."
"Speaker 3","00;32;12;27","00;32;15;04","So. OK, that's that's helpful. Thanks, Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;32;15;05","00;32;44;03","Yes. And I'm going to just show this image. This is I don't know if it's the very, very first, but this is the image that Lorenz used to talk about chaos in 1961. So I mean what's the difference between 76.8 and 76.85. It's imperceptible. If your thermometer only had like three significant figures, you wouldn't even be able to talk about the difference but I mean how different can it be."
"Speaker 1","00;32;44;16","00;33;13;14","And it turns out that these, those two systems start imperceptibly different. But nearby points in chaotic systems do diverge. And so it's like, OK, but they're still tracking each other, right? It's like, well no wrong. Later on and so of course a more chaotic system with a more positively operative exponent diverges faster. But any system with a positive leading the option of exponent is going to have divergence."
"Speaker 1","00;33;13;28","00;33;49;19","And so if you have a purely deterministic system or one without this kind of the option of induced chaos, then you can predict far out. However, prediction matter experts, as Dean, I'm sure, will revisit us to meet their match with chaotic systems. And that's actually one thing I hope that we get to by the end, which is that by putting action in every loop and inference on action, we can still, whichever of these timelines we end up on, we're going to be doing OK."
"Speaker 1","00;33;50;05","00;34;15;23","Because we're always readjusting our inference to whichever of these mountains we're on. It's not like one of these is better or worse or more or less challenging. Like they have the exact same upper and lower bound. The only mistake would be to make a prediction and be super confident about it and be on the wrong predictive timeline. But as long as we're always updating our predictions, then either of these days are going to be OK."
"Speaker 1","00;34;16;09","00;34;33;09","But if we put on the jacket because we thought that it was going to be cold here and that's when it was hottest, then we're injured. But if we just think, OK, well, we know we have the jacket, afford it, and so we're just going to keep an eye on that as we watch the temperature and continue to update our predictions, maybe then it'll be OK."
"Speaker 1","00;34;36;13","00;35;21;22","So that was the initial Lorenz attractor. Section three goes into the Helmholtz decomposition, which we've talked about in several other streams, and we've seen it introduced as the breaking down of a vector field, the total current in this kind of electromagnetic representation into the air rotational, which is kind of like the straight line. There's no rotation in those straight lines and the purely rotational solenoid or current flow currency, we've talked about solenoid in gradient partitioning and then what this paper does and I think the technical details are in the Appendix B of 16."
"Speaker 1","00;35;21;22","00;35;52;28","So that was the Bayesian Mechanics paper and then also there's this housekeeping, big lambda, and that's in one of the appendices to this paper. So that would be like something for someone else to help us understand a little bit of because it does matter and it's actually a key contribution because if the landscape is changing moment to moment, you can't just do the Helmholtz decomposition once and sail on that."
"Speaker 1","00;35;52;28","00;36;26;05","See without updating your estimate of the partitioning here of the decomposition here that decomposition. So again, dynamical systems, that's like the position of the car and then we're going to because of Section two, be having an equivalence between that dynamics and the flow modeling. And one of the terms that shows up on both of these is the fancy fancy I it's the self information."
"Speaker 1","00;36;26;25","00;36;52;26","The first part performs a reminder in gradient descent on the negative log of the steady state density, which can be interpreted as self information. So how surprised should one be to be at a given location relative to expectation? So we talked about how like the potential energy of the ball higher up on the ball is higher and then the potential function drops."
"Speaker 1","00;36;53;07","00;37;34;07","And that's the physical analogy to this more informational statistical distribution approach to the self information. And then in 3.1 that self information is going to be pursued and expanded upon for a a relatively more simple case. So we're going to identify due to the Helmholtz decomposition that there's this key variable which can be interpreted as like a potential function corresponding to the self's appraisal and that self's appraisal term may have functional forms."
"Speaker 1","00;37;34;28","00;37;42;25","So we can have a function that describes how surprised we should be Stephen Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;37;42;25","00;38;17;23","If you could go to that last slide, the previous one there that I think this is quite useful. So the Focker plank, if it's an equilibrium which we're not because we're doing non equilibrium steady state, but if it were then it would be zero basically is a equilibrium is not changing. So there's no, there's no divergence because it's zero and then he's taking this homo composition which in a way is like a vector with a vector you've got, you know, it can split some things, move into X and Y."
"Speaker 3","00;38;18;11","00;38;49;15","So this the gradient is coming out in the solenoid. It was at right angles to the gradient. So it's kind of like that trick that he does with accuracy and complexity. You can say that there's a solenoid or a land gradient which go together for when it's still in a kind of a particular angular momentum sense. And then there's that ability to with the housekeeping to then move into the flow, which I'm not entirely sure."
"Speaker 3","00;38;49;15","00;39;25;20","I think that's the bit where we might need some quite what, because flow could probably be more specifically thought about. So now you've got this ability to sort of sort of structure through the kind of more particular context, the solenoids and gradient. And then there's this transition to a more kind of general or variable, which can be just we don't need to get the particulars now because it's a, it's a variational metric that just gets used in an approximation sense."
"Speaker 3","00;39;26;09","00;39;31;11","And then follows into what you're saying, would I be on the right tracks with that?"
"Speaker 1","00;39;32;00","00;39;56;14","I'm not sure who he is, even though I have an expectation because it's a multi-person paper. But just looking at these as like circles and triangles and squares, we can see that upside down triangle, fancy eye of X is in both terms. So there's like a Q multiplied by something and then a gamma multiplied by something. And we see that omega is defined as like the Q minus the gamma."
"Speaker 1","00;39;56;29","00;40;27;26","So these two terms which were decomposed out from each other, get recombined into the final flow so that's just like if it were like a times X minus B times X, and then Omega were defined as a minus B times X. So we're re composing a flow equation that still features this fancy eye. And yes, we're solving that for a specific point that matters."
"Speaker 1","00;40;27;26","00;40;57;00","We want to solve that for where the balls at the bottom of the bowl. So there's a function there that's going to tell us more or less in multiple ways, whether we're more or less away from the bottom of the ball. And again, it's not about the system being at stationary, it's about this decomposition or having a fork or plank steady state."
"Speaker 1","00;40;58;11","00;41;00;02","Dean So you can see you've got."
"Speaker 3","00;41;00;17","00;41;18;29","Just one quick thing. So at the bottom of the bowl, if we the gradient can effectively be zero, but solenoid or could still have a value because it can still be spinning around the bottom of the bowl. But the gradient then because I notice the gradient term isn't in the flow, but the solenoid all term is."
"Speaker 1","00;41;19;10","00;41;34;11","A the gradient is because Q minus gamma is in omega. So Omega is this omega. Delta fancy is just these two terms combined OK? OK, yeah. Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;41;35;06","00;42;03;15","Yeah, I was just going to say what typically when this is brought forward, it's easier to understand the decomposition and the re compiling if we view the blanket as a partition, where it gets little bit more interesting is when the blanket is literally an envelopment and there's a there's a physicist by the name of Keith Humphries who talks about emergence and he looks at that piece of it as well because there's a polar aspect to this."
"Speaker 2","00;42;03;25","00;42;27;27","We can think of that in terms of positive and negative fields, magnetization and stuff like that and how that is also a decomposition and a re compiling. So I understand how it was presented in this paper. That's the partition way of looking at it. Right? It's more or less, but there's also the positive and negative polar piece to this."
"Speaker 2","00;42;27;27","00;42;53;08","When we look at the mark of a blanket as a blanket as opposed to a separator. And again, if we're holding up two things at once, this this doesn't just just change that. It just making sure that we hold both things up at once, the envelopment and the divider. I just want to bring that out there because again, we can we can see it easier as a partition like the skin as a partition."
"Speaker 2","00;42;53;12","00;42;58;14","We don't typically see the skin as a platform for sunscreen. That's my point."
"Speaker 1","00;42;59;29","00;43;00;29","Thanks, Steve. Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;43;03;02","00;43;29;01","You know, this, this, this this is a good point in terms of you can imagine at first I was thinking about gradient you know, it's obvious that you've got a gradient that you can pass through maybe where the gradient zero, but also solenoid will flow. I suppose if if things are moving around this way and then it starts to turn and it starts to go the other way at some point, the solenoid inflow is also passing through a zero."
"Speaker 3","00;43;29;09","00;43;35;22","So they can both pass through a zero point. It just wasn't as intuitive when I first thought about it."
"Speaker 1","00;43;36;06","00;44;05;18","Yeah. And even if you have something that's spinning around like something that's spinning in a circle like a hammer thrower, it's actually continual acceleration. That doesn't mean it's speeding up. It means that the vector is continually changing. So now our map is of that acceleration and it is unchanging in how it changes. So that is to say that the system can have added in a different way of thinking about it."
"Speaker 1","00;44;06;00","00;44;29;20","Yes, a solenoid or component. We're not saying that ball's at the bottom of balls are dead and unmoving. We're saying in our map there's only one point because we set it up to be like a ball map. Where the derivative is zero. That's the solution where the rate of change is zero. So that's not to say that the system isn't moving."
"Speaker 1","00;44;29;26","00;45;16;05","That's to say that the flow steady state has been achieved in figure four. Well, in Fig. three, we see the three states. So this is like the cover of the GB book, like kind of three different projections from a three dimensional system the second versus the third, first versus the third and the first versus the second. And we're seeing how there's movements of sampled trajectories and they're kind of coming back to something that's ball like for any set of two dimensions so it's kind of like a three dimensional ball now because any two of these dimensions, it's more like a regular bowl."
"Speaker 1","00;45;16;13","00;45;52;26","The kind of soup goes in. But then like the Super Bowl is like a down projection of a system that has an attractor in a higher dimension. Potentially a much higher dimension. But Lorenzo, they're only modeling three because the particle only moves in three dimensions when we continue to investigate the bowl like properties of our laplacian approximation to that Lorentz system, we see that there's a few different shapes of balls depending on which angle we're going to shine the flashlight from."
"Speaker 1","00;45;53;16","00;46;22;14","Some of them are like spherical so a spherical ball doesn't have any specific correlation between the two dimensions. It's like a cloud of points. The regression is just like flat through it. However, there are some couplings where the ball is non random. So it's almost like if we were tracking the movement of a ball, it's getting jostled around in these balls."
"Speaker 1","00;46;22;28","00;46;42;00","Well, like the one of the first and third, if that was the light we were shining, it would just look like it was a scatterplot. This are totally the regressions flat. There's not much information being provided. It's it's within the ball. So already has some nice dynamics, but it's kind of within that attractor zone. It's to scatter. There's no pattern."
"Speaker 1","00;46;42;17","00;47;04;19","But clearly for the first and the second we see that there is a coupling. Now, imagine if we didn't see the ball because of course we don't. It's not there. That's part of our map. We're just seeing the movement of that ball as we sample it through time. And it would be only on this manifold kind of being like spending more time going from the top left to the bottom right."
"Speaker 1","00;47;04;19","00;47;31;17","In these images. So we're going to take that idea and then connect it to the jacobian. And the question, which is again, throw back to our matrix math slide and an awesome opportunity for anyone who wants to bring more of a technical interpretation to the stream. The Jacobian is like the first, the unnamed matrix is just like the matrix of position."
"Speaker 1","00;47;32;16","00;47;59;14","So that's like the first moment of the distribution. And then higher moments are like the partial derivatives. So Jacobian is like the first order, partial derivative. So that's like the slope of the ruler at that point. And then the Hessian is the second partial derivative. That's like the curvature. So if it's a ball, there's only one point where it's flat and then it could be flat and the ball could be like up or the ball could be upside down."
"Speaker 1","00;47;59;29","00;48;26;25","And so that's why it's important to also have this second curvature term to understand whether we're at a ball like this or ball like that. So that's kind of like calculus. And those balls, those ball attractor shapes which we're inferring using the laplacian quadratic assumption. So it's not saying that the Lorenz has these processes. These is these, it's saying that's the approximation that we're going to make."
"Speaker 1","00;48;28;22","00;48;58;16","It turns out that although there's somewhat of an unclear correlation and pattern in the first derivatives, so like the movement to the left, it's not like it's correlated with movement up. However, the second partial derivative, the hessian matrix starts to look a lot like the covariance matrix. So the actual positional covariance of these states with each other. So like the on diagonal is kind of obvious."
"Speaker 1","00;48;58;16","00;49;30;01","Like of course your position on the x axis is, is correlated well with your position on the x axis but there are correlations between state one and two, and that is recapitulated in the structure of this second order polynomial approximation to these attractors that are laplacian approximations. So again, up until that point in 3.5 and in figure six, Markov has not been introduced."
"Speaker 1","00;49;31;10","00;49;53;06","Nothing has been said that word hasn't come into play. It didn't come into the systems definition. And so that's just really important because it's just showing like there's a lot of groundwork to get to where we make the Markov Ian partitioning. And so there's power and challenge in that."
"Speaker 3","00;49;53;11","00;50;25;20","Stephen Would I be correct in saying that effectively? So it's a case of approximating the states of the event attractor and that's what's currently there. So this is different ways of showing that within some manifold state space and by approaching it in different ways, it reveals a different type of approximation. The only thing I would ask, I'm a little bit confused."
"Speaker 3","00;50;25;20","00;50;40;08","Why does squish maybe I'm missing something. I can see why there'd be kind of a round one I'm just trying to work out how it squishes. Is it something to do because of the solenoid or piece or the gradient piece or is there something else?"
"Speaker 1","00;50;41;09","00;51;24;11","OK, so if we were talking about just a particle undergoing Brownian diffusion in three dimensions, so it doesn't have any kind of correlations or any sort of structure, just it's just a random walk in three dimensions. Well then it would have a spherical error profile for all of these images. But we are capturing structure that exists because Lauren's structure has a specific specification so the states are whichever are being modeled, if you care about pressure volume, that's your state space, that two dimensional state space of the map it's not saying those are the only states of that system."
"Speaker 1","00;51;24;11","00;52;08;25","It just those are the ones that you're modeling. In the Lorraine system, we have three states. It's position in three dimensions, but those three dimensions again also apply to a Brownian diffusing particle, which has a difference jacobian, covariance and hessian. We're talking about those being calculated for the Laurens system with the parameters that they selected. And so we are pulling out CO variances and connecting it to this second order polynomial approximation in the session for a system where the movement is not just a Brownian diffusion."
"Speaker 1","00;52;09;07","00;52;16;07","And so that's why there's structure in the covariance and that's why the structure is interestingly recapitulated in the question. Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;52;17;20","00;52;47;26","Yeah, and Hollywood Hollywood supplement that with this things, things. There we go. Things that are in something that's moving, the thing that's moving that's in something that's moving that's on something that's moving has a tendency to have the negative charged things all congregate in one place down in the lower right corner and all the positive things all congregate in another place in the upper left corner."
"Speaker 2","00;52;48;00","00;53;19;00","That's the nature of movement and so that polar part of it is in play as well. If we consider it as part of these statistical transitions, and that's again, it's it's fascinating if you if you look at it, a minimum of two things. So not just not just as a partition, but also as an envelope, those things suddenly pop out at you and you see the pattern in and in a different way."
"Speaker 1","00;53;20;03","00;53;37;10","So I want to think about a physical system that's not chaotic but will help us understand what this covariance matrix is. So let's think about a children's carousel so it moves. The horsey is moving around in a circle. And so that's like our unit circle, like the four quadrants. And then also the horse is going up and down."
"Speaker 1","00;53;37;29","00;53;59;23","OK, so when you're, you know, so again, it's like, you know, if you're at 12:00 on the carousel, it's like you have a one for the Y and a zero for X. OK, so hope that makes sense now as it goes around, it's like point five and point five. Again, just using simple numbers here, like the X and the Y are correlated and then they're also correlated here."
"Speaker 1","00;54;00;02","00;54;28;24","So one could say that there's like a correlation between the X and the Y. Like they have a covariance together but now the Z axis is moving up and down independently. So a system like that, you'd see a covariance between the X in the Y positions of the horsey and not that they're a different system, but they are uncorrelated."
"Speaker 1","00;54;28;24","00;54;55;17","They don't provide mutual information on the Z axis, which is oscillating. Now, if this paper had done, we model a deterministic carousel and it's kind of like putting the rabbit in the hat because the covariance matrix, it looking like this would be no surprise. Because it would have been defined that way. So that's the key insight. And one of the key contributions is like they didn't put this in the hat."
"Speaker 1","00;54;56;11","00;55;44;09","This is the OG complex system, yet the approximation, the Laplacian approximation pulls out a covariance structure that's extremely tractable, and it turns out that it still has a very strongly positive and very similar the often if exponential. So it's like now it's like a chaotic carousel. And yet our approximate in our map of that chaotic carousel still holds the chaotic nature of the system while also giving these ball like attractors for any given to and even all dimensions or states considered simultaneously."
"Speaker 1","00;55;44;25","00;56;13;17","So we're not conflating the simplicity of a non equilibrium steady state with the complexity of the underlying density dynamics. So just because the map is simple doesn't mean that the territory is. And so that to me is a knockout blow against realism and for instrumental ism because this paper saying nothing about the underlying system active doesn't say anything about the underlying system."
"Speaker 1","00;56;13;23","00;56;30;08","We're talking about approximations and our maps of territories. In other words, the probability density can evolve in a complicated fashion in attractors so go ahead, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;56;32;03","00;56;57;06","And from what you're saying is like if I was to take that Lorenzo tractor, which is like a saddle, would often people often talk about a saddle and you took the the the most agreeable way of viewing it. So you view it in in a box space this way and look for how it's moving that way and then flip the box like this and see how it's moving that way and flip the box."
"Speaker 3","00;56;57;16","00;57;51;03","But this is serious work in that way. Those approximations would be those three different distributions however, if you moved it by like one degree, that that would be like messy, right? So it's like there if you look it's almost like this is how the ends attract to take in the most optimal view of X, Y, Z can be mapped out as it transgresses through the saddle, if that makes sense to bring it into a physical space but again, it's more complex than that because this is taking it where there's the Focker plank is zero to try and get the most optimum sort of that's why those things are follow a nice stable transition."
"Speaker 3","00;57;51;03","00;57;59;22","Whereas if you take in a sort of an odd angle, it might all be completely a mess. Would that be a fair way of saying it."
"Speaker 1","00;58;01;22","00;58;30;11","If you were to take a perspective or a projection down that was a mixture of other axes, then not sure what is gained by that, but I see what you're saying. There's some particle moving in three dimensions and you can have a projection into any side of that cube or you could take some sort of off kilter view that would be still some type of linear summation of all three."
"Speaker 1","00;58;30;11","00;58;35;26","So it hasn't really reduced the challenge of estimating. But yes, I mean, that's one way to see it."
"Speaker 2","00;58;36;03","00;59;01;15","Dean So I'm in complete agreement. It it has to be instrumental so that you can compare it to the real to the minimum of two. You have to have multiple mats, not one in order to be able to see this. And that basically then reinforces the idea that a blanket has both at the same time be a partition and be an envelope."
"Speaker 2","00;59;01;26","00;59;15;15","It's both at the same time, a minimum of two again. So again, oh, heap reinforcing is that there's this idea that if we overproduce, if we get if we get to a place of under two, we may be deceiving ourselves."
"Speaker 1","00;59;17;03","00;59;50;00","And I think we'll come back to that soon. So now one hour in, we're able to get to the mark of blankets. OK, so previously we were talking about the case of a single Markov blanket. And so if we thought about like a Bayesian graph, so now we're thinking about three nodes, each corresponding to the X, Y and Z axis nodes A and B, you know, the first two axes would have like an edge between them because they have some type of statistical relationship."
"Speaker 1","00;59;50;28","01;00;25;04","And then it would be disconnected from the third node because it doesn't have a statistical relationship with them. OK, so now to actually start to get towards more like the communicating systems or system in the niche that we're interested in, that's the target that we're trying to aim towards in Section four the authors repeat the analysis of the previous section, but approximate to Lauren's systems that are coupled to each other through their respective first states."
"Speaker 1","01;00;25;20","01;01;03;01","OK, so we're going to look at this matrix. OK, so notice that there are two this make that transparent. So here's one Lauren's system. Here's the other Lauren's system, the red one and the blue one. And then there in these other cells, these are the coupling terms so these are couples. This is saying that the first state of each are coupled."
"Speaker 1","01;01;03;13","01;01;26;17","So it's a bi directional coupling and that it's saying like state one, the fourth state on the matrix like matrix row and call them four is the first state of the blue system. So the first state of the blue on the top left of the blue and the top left of the red are coupled through the off diagonal green boxed terms."
"Speaker 1","01;01;27;07","01;01;58;15","If this was all zeros, nine zeros here and nine zeros here, we would have two independ and evolving Lauren's systems. So we kind of took the Lauren system, the three by three matrix that specified the dynamics of that system. And then we just made another now a six by six matrix with two LAUREN systems that would be evolving statistically independently unless we introduce this targeted coupling."
"Speaker 1","01;01;59;10","01;02;25;28","Right. And they say this form of coupling was chosen to be as simple and symmetric as possible. OK, so this is like the next step, but it's a difference that makes a difference because this is going to change the total dynamics of it. If you had just the red and just the blue, you could like split that matrix and you'd be getting the exact same model ability because the systems wouldn't be interacting."
"Speaker 1","01;02;26;16","01;03;07;11","But now we've introduced these terms, even if we only had one where you can no longer divide this matrix into sub matrices that perfectly describe the time evolution of the system. So seven figure seven is like figure three. So similar. We're taking like sort of pinpoint locations on the Laplacian approximation of the Lauren's system. And now seven is doing the same, but it's looking at these two synchronized systems or maybe it's better to say that there's two coupled systems."
"Speaker 2","01;03;08;05","01;03;08;20","Tangled."
"Speaker 1","01;03;08;25","01;03;50;23","Due. Yes. And due to the structure of their coupling it results in an entangled movement pattern such that their trajectories have very have their trajectories are informative of each other. And that's also reflected by this flow diagram where clearly their movements exist on a manifold that's in a restricted space of the possible so two people, Brownian diffusing in two separate rooms, you'd get that circle scatterplot, OK, two people who are tied to each other you would see a perfect correlation."
"Speaker 1","01;03;51;09","01;04;10;27","And so we're seeing something. Even though each system has complex and even chaotic endogenous dynamics, we're seeing that the introduction of this coupling term allows the systems to actually empirically have entangled behavior."
"Speaker 3","01;04;11;01","01;04;37;13","Steven we've now got lumens systems as opposed to an attractor. And I'm curious, when does it go from an attractor to a system? Is it because that does the coupling effectively start to create more systemic nature? You know, I was just curious about that. Obviously, because of this appearance."
"Speaker 1","01;04;37;14","01;05;08;03","Systems, the Lorenz system is just these three. This is the specification of a Lawrence system. And it has and it's a chaotic attractor. And so now we're talking about two of them. So there's two coupled there different systems, but it doesn't make sense to talk about two coupled attractors because that's not what's coupled. The systems are coupled as per the matrix specification, and then it doesn't even make sense to couple the attractors the whole point is there is an attractor now by virtue of the coupling of the different systems."
"Speaker 3","01;05;08;29","01;05;23;18","Is it almost like once you start to have something and you're going to relate them as soon as things relate? There's a system because there's a relational quality to it, whereas previous that could be a mathematical formalism."
"Speaker 1","01;05;23;24","01;05;54;18","It was still described as Lawrence system. So I wouldn't get too hung up on that word. But yes, systems have multiple interacting parts OK, figure eight, just like seven revisited. The format of 38 is going to revisit four and now we're going to get to where we start to see the partitioning. Figure eight going to revisit four. So remember the first partial derivative, the second partial derivative in the Jacobian and the Hessian respectively, and then the covariance."
"Speaker 1","01;05;54;29","01;06;17;28","So we're going to do that same thing that we did on a three by three, but now we're going to do it on a six by six the log Jacobian looks a lot like this. The non-zero cells in the specification of the system which is the system itself for systems that we get to specify, it looks a lot like this."
"Speaker 1","01;06;17;28","01;06;48;18","But again, for territories, we don't get to specify the map. Looking like this does not say something specific about the territory, but it's not super surprising that we actually see like similar. This top right has like no correlation. Like one in three are not correlated and we see that little chip missing here and here. So we see a lot of the same dynamics at play within each of the couple different systems."
"Speaker 1","01;06;49;05","01;07;20;16","But also we've introduced a coupling. Now that coupling induces a new and different covariance structure. Look at these gray squares in the off diagonals. Now one and two of System A are coupled to one and two of System B less so a little bit greater than the one that are within each system, but still very market by directional synchrony is being induced."
"Speaker 1","01;07;21;23","01;07;45;09","The interesting piece comes into play when we look at this second order approximation, and that's where we see that several cells can be identified. So here we have like the magenta mute, please, Steven. Thank you. The magenta and the red are those first states of System A and B, those are the ones that have the coupling on the fourth."
"Speaker 1","01;07;45;19","01;08;09;24","OK, then you have the other two states of system A integral and the other two states of system B in dark blue. So it's almost like we have four kinds of states, four kinds of states out of these six, of course, you could say, well, each, each state is unique. Great. Totally true. They're different states. That's why we have those different dimensions in our model."
"Speaker 1","01;08;10;10","01;08;45;06","But there's going to be some interesting things that fall out as a function of us separating out the two systems and then separating out parts of the system that interface internally and externally and then parts of the system that do not directly by virtue of how we know we specified the system, do not couple out. Again, the fascinating thing is that like state two of system A and state two of System B have a covariance."
"Speaker 1","01;08;46;08","01;09;20;29","That's like maybe a mirror neuron. Again, using a more like realistic mapping. It's like there's some internal part that is only interacting with other internal parts by virtue of how the system is defined. And yet these two parts in each system, which are not directly interacting by virtue of how we set up the system, have covariant so that is what leads us to this numerical analysis, which kind of provides a little bit stronger and different empirical evidence."
"Speaker 1","01;09;20;29","01;09;52;10","So it's not just an analytical formulation, it's a numerical simulation where we can see that when we actually let that system play out, that even when states start very correlated, like we just start the third and the sixth states in a very similar position. So they start out with a high partial correlation coefficient. When we run out that simulation through time, it ends up trending towards zero partial correlation."
"Speaker 1","01;09;53;00","01;10;29;11","So we're recapitulating the correlation patterns of the system even when it starts in a more correlated place. And so that suggests that some very essential aspects of the system are being isolated intractably handled by this kind of partitioning of coupled systems so it's pretty interesting. Now, we've seen this topped iodine. Yes. And then just."
"Speaker 2","01;10;29;23","01;11;03;24","Quickly down here, what it also says is that hyper hyperbolic is also existing in this pattern, although it's not necessarily being materialized in these diagrams, it's also there. I mean, what that's what this explains is that there can be continuity, there can be alignment and there can be hyperbolic function within all at the same time. Again, that's I just want to again, I just want to point to the non-obvious but it's still there great."
"Speaker 1","01;11;04;10","01;11;06;29","So we've seen this top of Stephen. Yes."
"Speaker 3","01;11;09;16","01;11;42;07","I was also going at that. So by showing the nature of the coupling by vary in the nature of the coupling that you showed, it's a reach you can reach a different sort of state, non equilibrium, steady state in some ways. Would that be true if there's a different pattern emerges as so it could speak, maybe I'm overextending this, but changing the nature of how things couple could in a way change the sort of states which things can fall into."
"Speaker 3","01;11;42;07","01;11;49;09","So you could almost have multiple states being inferred based on how the coupling is set up."
"Speaker 1","01;11;49;21","01;12;17;25","Oh, yes. I mean, we would throw out any model that treated two people tied to each other as simply moving the same way as two people in different rooms. It is the coupling of systems that influence their behavior. And again, we're not talking about the causal structure of the world territory. We're talking about the models that we got to specify and how changing the coupling pattern changes their behavior."
"Speaker 1","01;12;18;12","01;12;18;23","Dean."
"Speaker 2","01;12;19;22","01;13;04;29","Yeah, and Steven, when you're taking the abstraction, you're off the page. So you could set up your programing, for example, that says, OK, I'm willing to sponsor somebody because I want to mentor them in bricklaying. You can start with that or you can start with there's two people that are interested in bricklaying, but the first thing we have to address is whether there's a potential for positive entanglement that in real terms, that's how you can flip the the abstraction into the the the likelihood of those entanglements turning out extending because the people will actually be relatable to one another."
"Speaker 2","01;13;05;23","01;13;13;18","So that I'm just again, I'll bring that up because that's how we turn the abstraction into the. So what does that look like?"
"Speaker 1","01;13;14;25","01;13;17;03","OK, Stephen, something quick on this, otherwise we'll get to ten."
"Speaker 3","01;13;17;13","01;13;56;22","Oh, yeah. Just very quickly. Yeah. So that that speaks to because we often think about the the the model on the inside the generative model and the external states and, you know, the model trying to understand what the external states are doing. But this speaks to the ability to, to change the, the way the blanket is coupling. So you know, how much work is going on in terms of enabling that to be information variation or free energy information being used in the generative models, how much is being done by actually changing coupling dynamics in the blanket?"
"Speaker 3","01;13;57;11","01;14;11;14","Is that even feasible that, you know, because that in itself will start to yield more and more ways for the generative model to start to extract and making friends is based on what's going on externally. So that that also helps, I think."
"Speaker 1","01;14;11;14","01;14;32;19","So as a hearing stick fat pump yes, great. But actually the blanket is downstream of the coupling pattern. So it's like changing the coupling of a blanket is a little bit of a cart before the horse because there is the coupling of the system and that is what induces partitioning, which we can then map to Markov and assumptions."
"Speaker 1","01;14;32;19","01;14;50;24","So it's like you know, when you put on headphones and you're listening to this, yes, a different blanket is in play because the partitioning is different, because the coupling is different between other states in the world. Dean on this and then let's go to ten."
"Speaker 2","01;14;51;11","01;15;04;07","Yeah, be real quick. So like purses at call centers versus abduction doesn't guarantee that when you walk in later and see Beenz in one hand and a bag of beans in the other that you'll get to a."
"Speaker 1","01;15;08;02","01;15;16;06","OK, I just lost Ian, so I'm going to continue. So in figure ten but he was talking about abduction and see us Pierce."
"Speaker 2","01;15;17;12","01;15;34;13","Kind of that flipping that I understand you're right it is the cart ahead of the horse and sometimes that helps not saying it's you and I know you're agreeing with me, but all I'm saying is we shouldn't just assume that it only goes one way horse first, cart second."
"Speaker 1","01;15;34;26","01;16;04;08","Yes, and in fact, partitioning differ imagining differences ways. It could be different. Absolutely. This is how we are going to apply and ask what is if for active inference like what is is like what is the blanket states given a coupling pattern? Well, there's an answer. Sensory states are the ones with incoming statistical dependencies and active states are the ones with outgoing statistical dependencies."
"Speaker 1","01;16;04;08","01;16;26;23","Those are the blanket states. What if the coupling were different? Then what would the blanket be? So, yeah, it's not that that first blanket that you identified is being changed. What's being changed is the coupling, which induces a different kind of covariance among the states, but it can be almost thought of in a cart before the horse way."
"Speaker 1","01;16;27;05","01;16;59;08","So just to recap this nomenclature, which we've seen before, so we have external states, sensory states, active states and internal states. B is the set of blanket states. So this is one of the innovations of Freeston at all beyond Perl. 1988 beyond Markov at all earlier or there earlier is that blanket states which in the non fip active world are the set of states upon which conditionally internal and external states are independent."
"Speaker 1","01;17;00;03","01;17;26;09","Those blanket states again we're going to partition them into incoming and outgoing statistical dependencies, sense and action. Now we have autonomous states alpha which is the set of active states and internal states. Autonomous states are the ones that for systems that we design, we get to control, we get to control our internal states, we get to control our actions we don't get to control directly the sensory input."
"Speaker 1","01;17;26;27","01;17;52;26","You can close your eyes so that it's darker or you can move your head so it looks differently. And maybe you'll even be right about what sensory information comes in. Ben But you can't just say I want different sensory information coming in. So those are the autonomous states. And then there's the particular states. The particular states are the whole particle."
"Speaker 1","01;17;53;10","01;18;13;13","That's the blanket states which are sensing action and the internal states. So the particular states are like the whole particle floating around in the room or the whole cell or whatever, again, to give the physical interpretations. And then the autonomous ones are like the things that the cell can control or the thing that the system designer can control."
"Speaker 1","01;18;13;20","01;18;32;26","So we have autonomous states which composed of internal and action states, blanket states, action and sense, particular all three on the right side. And these are all being defined as a partitioning, a cleaving apart from external states as modeled not of the territory of the map."
"Speaker 3","01;18;32;26","01;19;06;17","Only Stephen and as we mentioned here, this, this, this paper gives a way for this to emerge from the very most basic principles. And then we have, like you describe the the blanket states, the autonomous states, of course, in any sort of system organism, non equilibrium steady state, there is a nested. So it's not like the, the there will be a whole nested levels of Markov in blankets."
"Speaker 3","01;19;07;02","01;19;46;21","So these when we emerge at higher levels, we might be emerging. It's not like unless we made our blanket there'll be no blanket, there's going to be blankets all the way up and down. So as a blanket starts to be formed or brought into play, then the the nature of how that those blankets come into play starts to draw in the idea of coupling, you know, so maybe there's this there's some of those things that you just mentioned there about there's not a dependency."
"Speaker 3","01;19;46;21","01;20;10;28","The fact that we've created something from first principles doesn't mean in the real world, without the first principles, we can't make a blanket because in other cases it's going to be sort of emergent through more coupling between blankets. Because I know to we're talking about the blanket, but it's also good to break the blanket in this scale and then the blankets in plural at the multi scale."
"Speaker 1","01;20;12;14","01;20;48;19","OK, yeah. So within internal states, again, these are statistical dependencies. So this one can have other things happening. It's like a black box within each one. And so that is for people who expect to see the mechanics of the system, that's a disappointment. But for people who want a model real systems, including machines, it's a huge advantage because it allows us to go in keeping the map territory distinction totally apparent which is the real transparency we need from our machine learning models."
"Speaker 1","01;20;48;26","01;21;21;12","You know, there's not going to be a transparent explanation for how 500 variables interact, but we can also transparently see potentially how the map and the territory are distinguished. Now that's where we get to their definition of markup called blankets so let others read through and work through the math and critique it and build on it. But we're talking about boundaries based upon sub matrices of the total state space of the system."
"Speaker 1","01;21;22;06","01;21;54;19","So like this is just two coupled systems that we're talking about here. We were studying like System A and System B, each is Lorenz. We added the coupling to one and four and that's where we saw a new pattern arising why does a particular partition comprise four sets of states? Is it because tetrahedra are the minimum polyhedra in our world in other words, why does a particular partition consider two Markov boundaries?"
"Speaker 1","01;21;55;15","01;22;29;06","The reason is that the particular partition, again, particular states blanket and internal. The particular partition is a minimal partition that allows for directed coupling with blanket states sensory states can influence internal states, incoming dependencies, and active states can influence external states, outgoing dependencies without destroying the conditional in dependencies of the particular partition, as shown in the upper figure upper panel."
"Speaker 1","01;22;29;06","01;23;01;08","The figure ten. So very cool how we went from one coupled system, from one system with chaotic dynamics, made an approximation and then showed that it had certain well behaved aspects. And then we took like the next step up, which is two couple systems in a way that we designed and that gave a new manifolds that the systems were acting entangled as if within."
"Speaker 1","01;23;02;05","01;23;32;18","And then here's where we get that very fun claim that there's no claim either the original Lawrence System or coupled Lawrence System possesses a Mark Blanket. We're not describing the territory. I don't even think we're even describing the first level of the map. The claim here is that there exists a laplacian approximation to these kinds of systems that inverts you of the zero elements of the hash in feature markup blankets."
"Speaker 1","01;23;33;05","01;23;55;16","So this is one reason why, you know, while also acknowledging that there's many perspectives and so much to learn that we do want to be precise with our language, because it's easy enough to say that the system has a Markov blanket or there is a markup blanket in the system or all these other ways which prepositions and nouns might be combined."
"Speaker 1","01;23;56;02","01;24;23;03","And those might be so misleading it could be truly incredible. So it's a word of warning because as we figure out exactly what the technical details are and continue to clarify here, it will matter which natural language words we use to describe it, and it really does matter. Dean."
"Speaker 2","01;24;24;05","01;24;54;02","So let me add to that, Dennis, on an abstract level, we can we can frame the problem as as in or out. And then when we translate that into the physical space, we know when something is entangled or when something is different. But I think what this allows us for in the abstract level is to example, to sample all the mark off blanket as in and out."
"Speaker 2","01;24;54;02","01;25;32;25","It gives us the potential for a second way of looking at how those two things work together. The markup blanket has both a divider and an envelop. Do you agree so. So on an abstracted level, it's very important to be precise. But if we include this, we have to accept the fact that on an abstracted level, in and out must be part of our our repertoire, not just in or out, because one is more precise."
"Speaker 2","01;25;33;13","01;25;41;03","What is active inference, while the other allows for what if active inference the end would you agree?"
"Speaker 1","01;25;42;22","01;26;26;23","I think I agree. I'm just imagining that it could be possible to design a system where there was one coupling going out, but there was no coupling back in so one could devise edge case matrices that have various kinds of properties would those even be good maps of systems that we care about? Probably not. So for some of the basic attributes like of communication and of course, if one person's not wearing their headphones, like, yeah, the systems are coupled, one person's talking and the other person can hear them but not return any information right?"
"Speaker 1","01;26;26;26","01;26;56;02","So it's like that's interesting. It's a type of coupling that systems can have and it has a different blanket because of that. But especially for systems where we want to think about states that are influencing the environment and vice versa, whether it's communication or stigma, or coupling or collective behavior, that whole class of systems, it's extremely important to have, of course, in and out and more and less and different."
"Speaker 2","01;26;57;26","01;27;25;15","I wouldn't drop. I wouldn't drop or sorry, Steven, I just got to get this and I wouldn't drop or I'm actually suggesting that we we this tells us we must also contemplate. And so that's like saying, OK, so which is more important to the positive ions or the negative ions think they're going to conjugate and we can tell the difference, but we shouldn't apply a value all the time."
"Speaker 2","01;27;25;21","01;27;46;26","There are times when we can just see the difference and accept that for what it for what it is as opposed to always jumping to the idea that something has to be more or less that that the positive ions are more important than the negative ones. Maybe they are, but we shouldn't jump to that. Right away. Done and done."
"Speaker 1","01;27;48;27","01;27;52;05","OK, closing thought on this, Steven, and then we're going to get to free energy principle."
"Speaker 3","01;27;53;02","01;28;15;17","Yeah. So yeah, just just mention a little bit to what Dean said there. I like the. Yeah, if something is a charged particle, how much is the system of the molecule showing the distribution of charge and how much is the quantity of the thing this of that thing? Right. So I suppose and that that becomes I don't think there's a definite transition."
"Speaker 3","01;28;15;28","01;28;40;08","And I'm glad you went back to this diagram this is the one I was just want to mention that. And just to the the arrows there on the right. So we're sensory states. It shows that the sensory states are related to the same external states as the action states are affecting. So it shows it's almost like there's there's a regime of attention."
"Speaker 3","01;28;41;24","01;29;21;12","So it's not the sensory states aren't reading something coming in about something which is completely unrelated to, you know, it's not like I'm looking I'm acting in front of me, but actually my eyes in the back of my head. Right. So my sense is that there's an alignment and then when I look to the left, this this coupling that's going on, then between in the way that it's set up, between this, it's saying it's, it's, it's, it's not a mark of blanket when it's saying is a coupled system so it's sort of saying in a way that this more slight is more nascent version."
"Speaker 3","01;29;22;01","01;29;47;07","There's this kind of there's still a spookiness about it, I suppose you might say. Is this sort of a it's not it's not it doesn't drop out as far as a mark or blanket. There's, there's that kind of resonation going on and I suppose somewhere between left and right you start to become, you meet the, the conditions of a mark or blanket."
"Speaker 3","01;29;47;16","01;29;50;21","And I suppose, you know, that's an interesting point."
"Speaker 1","01;29;51;24","01;30;18;05","I don't want to just make the water murky with too many terminology. We haven't brought attention in. It's not related to what we are discussing here. But I see what you mean that yes, if actions were influencing state A, you know, your actions were moving something up or down, but you were observing the left, right? Yes. That's a different kind of system then if you're observing and acting on the up down movement of something that's not a regime of attention."
"Speaker 1","01;30;18;05","01;30;26;02","But I know what you mean. Let's get to the f eep. OK, finally."
"Speaker 1","01;30;29;07","01;31;07;28","Remember that edges reflect statistical relationships, which is the other side of the coin of saying that the absence of an edge reflects a conditional independence. So one can provide a definition of the conditional density over external states. So a probability density. That's why it was so important to go from dynamics to densities in Section two. And we're going to think about that external density probability density, conditional statistical density as being parameterized by the conditional expectations of internal states given external states."
"Speaker 1","01;31;08;22","01;31;28;27","Here's the formalism. See how the coupled systems have a flow where like given where you were on what even if it were a little noisier, as long as it looked like an oval, as long as you were like, you know that if you were low on the left, you were going to be low on the up and down."
"Speaker 1","01;31;29;04","01;31;46;15","And if you were further to the right, you'd be higher up on the y axis. OK, but imagine if the flow was like in a circle, you'd say, OK, we're at X on the zero. Well, you really don't know because you could be low, you could be high. Or imagine if it was just like a scatter cloud. No matter where you were, you would think it was everywhere."
"Speaker 1","01;31;46;15","01;32;20;11","In the box you wouldn't really know. But because there's a manifold, then this admits the possibility of a defeo morphic, which means like sort of like function like an stretchable map between the sufficient statistics of the respective densities not the territory, not the first map. I don't even know if we're on the second map anymore. We're talking about sufficient static sticks of densities of approximations."
"Speaker 1","01;32;20;29","01;32;47;21","OK, I think it's a deathblow for realism personally, but I would love to hear somebody who thinks it's not. The existence of this mapping rests upon a continuously differentiable and invertible map, which is linear under the place approximation. There's a few technical pieces there, but it's almost like we set up the system in a way that was defined only by its coupling."
"Speaker 1","01;32;48;11","01;33;15;09","But then we also got to choose our approximation approach, and it turns out that with a system with interesting coupling dynamics enough to befuddle almost every other kind of model out there, the approximation has a really nice relationship that recapitulates aspects of the system and lets us map. Like if we're on low on here, we can go to low on here and low and here."
"Speaker 1","01;33;15;09","01;33;56;21","Too low in here. Like it's a kind of, it's a function that can go both ways. And so that is going to be the relationship sigma mapping between the internal and external states, which was explored more in the Bayesian Mechanics paper number 26. This means the autonomous flow can be expressed as a gradient flow on a free energy functional of the variational density here are those four states, four kinds of states, external sense action internal and those are going to be expressed as a tuple."
"Speaker 1","01;33;56;24","01;34;28;24","It has to be because it has to be all four of those states co evolving and those have a gradient flow gamma and then the upside down triangle plus the solenoid will flow. So remember way back when when we saw that we had Q so in idle G Gamma for gradients and then lambda for housekeeping. OK, so now that is coming back into play, the soul annoyed all is still a single term."
"Speaker 1","01;34;29;05","01;35;07;20","That's just the, the potential function that self appraisal and one solenoid all term. Then we have a gradient over these four states and then the lambda housekeeping that can be rewritten and now Pi again let, let the ontology develop so that we can resolve some of this. But notice how particular states PI are the blanket and the internal OK but how have we usually used PI policy action selection?"
"Speaker 1","01;35;08;02","01;36;16;22","So this is a different PI. Yeah, the free energy functional on particular states. Particular states let's call them equals the self appraisal on the particular states plus the divergence term that is the form that then lends the ability to interpret that free energy functional on particular states to be rewritten in several ways, including energy minus entropy. That's a very classical chemical way to talk about free energy, to be phrased as the divergence between the Q distribution on external states and the P distribution on external states conditioned on particular states plus the self surprise all of those particular states or the one that's closest to the Bayesian information criterion, Bayesian modeling world but still being shown"
"Speaker 1","01;36;16;22","01;36;47;11","as equivalent to is the accuracy of minus model complexity and the evidence lower bound. So that's where we've seen that these formalisms come out many, many times, but we're approaching it from a very different way and a lot more bottom up. And I think but again, would be open to people correcting in a way that fully embraces the map territory distinction and makes no bones about it."
"Speaker 1","01;36;47;20","01;37;14;05","Whereas if you just pop in from the top with these formalisms, it might seem like they're describing aspects of the system. But I hope that the way we've approached this over the last like 6 hours of live streams literally, and the way that the authors wrote it so carefully makes it clear. We're talking about these formalisms on probably not even the first map and maybe the second map or summary statistics thereof."
"Speaker 1","01;37;14;20","01;37;27;16","These are relationships that are intrinsic to our approach of mapmaking because we did the laplacian approximation et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Stephen And then D."
"Speaker 3","01;37;29;09","01;38;05;04","Yeah, this is very helpful. I might just ask, we go and walk through the very first sentence again in a second just because I think would be helpful, just to reiterate. But from what you're saying and I, I hear this really clearly is the particular states and the thickness of maintain in particular states potentially or of whatever those particular states persist effectively than is the same when at a higher order level over time and space as a policy because let's not."
"Speaker 1","01;38;05;09","01;38;09;21","Bring policy over yet we haven't gotten there, but we can say to internal states."
"Speaker 3","01;38;10;05","01;38;43;04","OK, I won't I won't jump the gun on that, but I I suppose the point is just to say that we can still be in the realm of things this OK, we can still be in the realm with thickness because we're talking about particular states of things. So we haven't got and I won't say beyond that. And then maybe just just to go through the ontology, not just of that first sentence just to reiterate, just to get it clearer, again, autonomous flow expected internal state."
"Speaker 3","01;38;43;04","01;38;48;28","Could you just recap that just to just unpack that a little bit more just so that it's a little bit clearer."
"Speaker 1","01;38;50;18","01;39;15;10","OK, so the autonomous flow so autonomous states are actions which are not we're not even bringing policy selection. And so it's the right direction. We want to go we want to be talking about internal states that are actually doing planning as inference that effect their action states. But for now, we're just treating the action states as outgoing statistical dependencies."
"Speaker 1","01;39;15;21","01;39;39;25","And then we're just we're pausing on how the actions are selected. We're just because do run system, there's no policy selection, but there are external states that are modified by states those are the active states. So it's almost like we can talk about action without policy inference. So the autonomous states, the autonomous flow at the expected internal state."
"Speaker 1","01;39;40;16","01;40;37;26","So these are expectations of autonomous states action, outgoing internal states can be expressed as a gradient flow. So now it's like we're going to rather than have a six state system, we're going to rewrite as four. Remember, we pulled out four kinds of notes and now we're going to express a flow not in a six dimensional space where each dimension was a measurement that we were making, but express a flow over the four kinds of states and then that means that even if there was a bunch of internal nodes that were communicating to each other, we could still use this fourfold breakdown."
"Speaker 1","01;40;38;11","01;41;05;08","Hashtag William Blake, hashtag Bucky Hashtag for Austin. No matter how many specifics were inside the internal or how many blanket states there were, like how many nodes in the graph or how many external states, because now it's like a flow over kinds of nodes. And then that because the nodes are defined by their directionality of relationship, like how they influence each other, right?"
"Speaker 1","01;41;05;08","01;41;20;00","Like internal and external, we know don't directly influence each other. They're conditionally independent based upon blanket states, et cetera. That allows us to write formalisms that are like evergreen and can be expressed as flow. Dean."
"Speaker 2","01;41;21;06","01;41;44;10","Yeah, I would just say that when I, when I first encountered these kind of formalisms, I always ask so and then what happened? And that's when I coined the phrase when in doubt, zoom, zoom out. But I didn't want that zooming in and zooming out to be collapsed just to the optical zoom. I just assumed that your legs wouldn't be compromised when you picked up a telescope or a microscope."
"Speaker 2","01;41;44;11","01;42;07;05","That you would still zoom in and zoom out by moving. Right. So the inference is in doubt. So how do you overcome that? You become more active, but not just with your eyes. You actually pick yourself up and move yourself around a little bit more, a lot. You don't just have to be on the on the north end of the carousel."
"Speaker 2","01;42;07;29","01;42;32;25","Sometimes you can pick up a ladder and look down on it as well. And that that'll give you a whole new set of data or more complementary data, a different collection. And so that's why I think it's really, really good to be able to see that and understand what it implies. It basically says if you're if you're if you're not sure at some more."
"Speaker 1","01;42;36;19","01;43;20;05","OK, could I disagree with action? First off, let's just look at this slide then, Stephen. So this functional the flow over the four kinds of states that is using this blanket partitioning paradigm can be expressed in several forms. Expected energy e big is expectation, expected energy minus the entropy of the variational distribution, the Q Variational distributions like the one that we get to control Q of MU, that's the Q of internal states, which is equivalent to the self information fancy plus the scale divergence between the variational and conditional density."
"Speaker 1","01;43;20;12","01;43;52;26","That's this k l divergence term, which is always greater than zero. So self appraisal is always zero or greater. You can't have negative appraisal. And then the divergence is always going to be positive as well. This can be decomposed into accuracy and complexity so that's this third framing. And in that setting, negative free energy becomes the evidence lower bound or elbow, which will be familiar to many people with machine learning backgrounds."
"Speaker 1","01;43;54;02","01;44;16;09","OK, amazing. So those are the three different formalisms and how they fell out. This is the basis of the free energy principle. What's the free energy principle? Put simply, it means that the expected internal states of a particular partition at non equilibrium steady state can be cast as encoding conditional or Bayesian beliefs about external states."
"Speaker 1","01;44;18;16","01;44;52;13","That's the free energy principle in this paper. Not the first and not the last way it'll be defined and not the only. But that's how they discuss it here. And basically we moved from early on. It's like tying our shoe with a density to dynamics side. And now we have this whole universe of formalisms that connect free energy looking formalism is like chemistry with information theory, formalisms."
"Speaker 1","01;44;53;03","01;45;57;02","So thermo chemistry with energy and entropy with thermo information divergence and self information to information and inference with accuracy minus complexity as a modeling heretic so that big free energy is big. And then they immediately go to talk about physiological perspectives and how that surprise or function that constitutes the potential is log model evidence. So if you're getting good evidence for your physiological model, you're spending a lot of times in your preferred and expected physiological states, and that can be seen as simply a statement of homeostasis where outgoing statistical dependencies, i.e. active states, maintain intercept of signals, i.e. incoming state sensory states within characteristic physiological ranges."
"Speaker 1","01;45;57;24","01;46;03;04","You minimize your surprise about that until you don't and you dissipate."
"Speaker 3","01;46;04;09","01;46;36;14","Stephen Amazing. And this this really ties into the active influence paradigm shift because, OK, traditionally if we're going to have represented not traditionally representation is for instance, like you were saying, it does really, really throw that out in a way because if I have a hundred cameras normally and I took a hundred different cameras all taking a photo, it's going to make it a hundred times more blurry in that sense."
"Speaker 3","01;46;36;19","01;47;16;15","However, in this sense, a hundred sources in this noisy dynamic cool gives me a hundred ways to integrate free energy reduction and even actually the noise of me moving it a hundred ways by 100 cameras gives me more and more information or thermodynamic ways in so that that just shifts very much the way we might think about how to know about how to act in the world, how cool."
"Speaker 1","01;47;18;02","01;47;33;15","Let's continue on and we'll probably do a few minutes after the hour to get to these last few points. So we've been talking about different ways that we can talk about the free energy functional of the particular states."
"Speaker 1","01;47;35;17","01;48;18;14","5.1 is where this idea of the internal states as a generative model and self evidencing or like the minimization of self surprise is really leaned into. So the alternative and deflationary perspective rests on noting that the free energy gradients are also the gradients of self information. So it's like the free energy itself is a wind that's difficult to latch onto so the free energy ball, the one where you'd be doing strictly as well as you could if you were on the bottom of it, were not on Apple, but the one that we can be keenly aware of is our self's appraisal."
"Speaker 1","01;48;19;18","01;48;53;10","So if the self surprise of gradients is aligned with the free energy gradients, then reducing our uncertainty about sensory states, incoming helps us on the way towards minimizing free energy gradients, reducing that difference. The organism wants to be minimally surprised about expected and preferred observations, and those are the perceptions or measurements. More technically it wants to be minimally surprised about."
"Speaker 1","01;48;53;10","01;49;29;28","Expect mid states and then preferences are going to play a key role. When we talk about active systems that do resist dissipation this is where the moth to the flame comes in. I just I love this plot arc from 2006 Ice Queen Kristen with the wings snowflake and then you know things are heating up for act in others are being drawn like a chaotic moth to the flame they come close but then it burns and then they fly away further."
"Speaker 1","01;49;30;16","01;50;00;29","So one could imagine these kinds of systems to be like stochastic chaos and that could be now again we're thinking about previously the learned system was like maybe a particle in a chaotic weather system. So that was like the weather systems that Lorenz was studying but now we're going to be thinking about particular states, like a particular moth that's able to not just have outgoing statistical dependencies, but to do policy selection."
"Speaker 1","01;50;01;13","01;50;23;26","So this is where we actually get adaptive active inference and again, you know, if there's two kinds of moths, some of them are just particles, and then they get burnt when they get burnt and they don't win, they don't some will survive and some what. But the ones that do enact effective policy selection are going to be persisted even a day later."
"Speaker 1","01;50;24;11","01;50;57;29","So then the Lepidoptera have been around for millions of years. So is it really any surprise that the moths have adaptive behavioral systems, but that when the niche changes like with electric and nighttime lighting, that that doesn't entail that it's going to instantly be the adaptive system for that new niche we can think about the motion of a moth attracted towards a flame, but constantly thwarted by turbulent or so in idle air currents, because active states influence sensory states and possibly external states."
"Speaker 1","01;50;58;08","01;51;22;22","This would look as if the particle, the moth, was trying to attain its most likely state in the face of random fluctuations and solenoid dynamics. So it's like there's those arrows that your rotational component are like converging the moth to the flame but then like Overshoot and the windy room are blowing it around. And so again, there's the moth in the room and we can look at it in the X, Y, and Z."
"Speaker 1","01;51;23;06","01;51;48;07","And if the candle were in the center of the room, it would be like a ball that the moth were converging towards for any two dimensions that you looked at. And indeed all three dimensions when considered together. And the movement of that particle, the dynamics of that particle would be related to something about the flow of the air in that room with a pull back attractor."
"Speaker 1","01;51;49;11","01;52;22;17","This perspective emphasizes the active part of self evidencing sometimes referred to as active inference. So we were calculating the potential to self surprise all the outgoing dependencies for particles before we talked about policy selection, and that is showing mere active inference as it's called. But then when you think about the real world where only the anti dissipate of systems persist and the successful ones even more so, that's where policy selection comes into play."
"Speaker 1","01;52;23;09","01;52;51;26","And that's actually where this paper ends. They basically just bring it to that point and say all systems are going to be able to be framed within this way. Again, not the territories. All of the approximations that we make will have these attributes and then we can imagine that there are some systems where the internal states are not just acting as if they're doing conditional expectations on external states."
"Speaker 1","01;52;52;07","01;53;30;08","But then they take those conditional expectations like about the weather. And then there's another node for policy selection. Like the other PI policy selection in the models we've seen. And then that PI can be like put on the jacket or not those like the two affordances or those are the two states in the affordance variable. And then in a disruptive world, you're going to see adaptive agents as the ones that are able to recurrently adapt to changing and chaotic circumstance to repeatedly come back to that candle."
"Speaker 1","01;53;30;29","01;54;31;18","And so just to summarize, then we'll just if there's any implications we want to touch, but we'll summarize they constructed a laplacian system that's quadratic in a bowl like in its potential function and flow operators state dependent flow operators, by the way, that includes the housekeeping function that evinces so provides evidence for stochastic chaos because it has that the option of exponent that was very similar to the ones that were calculated from the non Laplace assumptions or approximations the way that the polynomial approximation played out with the first and second order approximations gave a spa city which can be interpreted as conditional in dependencies and a partitioning into four kinds of states coupled systems have"
"Speaker 1","01;54;32;03","01;54;54;06","a conditional synchronization map. In this example, it had a linear form they were on that manifold that was like Y equals X. And this is important because in these laplacian coupled systems, the conditional synchronization map is necessary early DeFeo Morphic again would be awesome if somebody wanted to come on and like help us see what the technical implications of the DeFeo Morph ism is."
"Speaker 1","01;54;55;10","01;55;25;05","But the simplest level is like it doesn't bend back on itself, so it's a good function. So that means for every sensory state, there's a unique expected internal state and conditional density over external states. So it'd be like, yeah, when the thermometer says like 20, it could be 20 or 50. That's not a very helpful thermometer. Now, if you say the thermometer always reads half of the temperature or it's always double or it's a little noisy, those are all workable."
"Speaker 1","01;55;25;15","01;56;03;19","But like the thermometer could just totally be deceiving you. And then it just is a it's a wacky world with what the thermometer says. Not going to be a very adaptive system. The resulting formulation can be read as Bayesian mechanics, in which internal states on average parameter eyes belief of a Bayesian sort about external states, just like these equations when applied to particles and statistical distributions, were a statistical mechanics were taking the full Bayesian insight and reading these equivalences in formalism as a Bayesian mechanics."
"Speaker 1","01;56;04;11","01;56;12;09","So that's the summary of 52. And then there's a few implications that they get into. But what first have any questions? So Dean and then Steven."
"Speaker 2","01;56;14;03","01;56;47;27","Well, I just think it's fascinating. That does matter whether we're talking Monzer or people, we're kind of blissfully unaware of the statistical manifold floating around us prior to us being pulled back to that flame and either becoming the hero moth or the fool moth. We don't discover that until afterwards. But if we could be aware of the kind of this statistical distribution in play prior to us being told it might help, I don't think it does."
"Speaker 2","01;56;47;28","01;56;56;00","I don't think it determines much, but it's certainly enlightened as opposed to being lit up yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;56;56;01","01;57;12;24","The moth example, I think. Well, you know, but if it really reaches the flame, it dies. So maybe that's not even the final perfect example for how attractors work. That'd be like a whole a ball with a hole at the bottom. So again, it just it's, it's a terroristic. It helps us think about the kinds of systems that we're talking about."
"Speaker 1","01;57;12;24","01;57;24;04","But realism interpretation, asides, even that example doesn't capture the whole thing because it's a metaphor, because it's like map of map of territory. So it's totally chill."
"Speaker 3","01;57;24;11","01;58;26;26","Stephen Yeah this the evidence in and then says stochastic chaos, which wasn't a word I'd heard of before to be honest is this idea of equality so that that's really useful there how it gives a sense of how both there can be chaos in the attractor and the noise maintained at least at some level throughout because the in most cases the noise is just average the way in other scenarios so this is this is this this piece where it's tapping into that quality is really interesting and then that then tying into the Bayesian mechanics all the way down is very, very useful, especially when I think the Bayesian mechanics, this, as mentioned before, is stacked."
"Speaker 3","01;58;27;07","01;58;57;15","It's like it's not saying this is where everything is different to evidence in. It's like we're going to give better evidence which or better evidence which make us think we're going to show a more accurate lens, attract a solution. Now is evidence is and we can stack up and add these fuzzy qualities together and we'll still have a fuzzy quality, but maybe we'll have one which is a little bit more practical, and that's the game in town."
"Speaker 3","01;58;57;15","01;59;01;20","Here is practicality. So I like that too."
"Speaker 1","01;59;01;21","01;59;42;14","Also it does average out noise. The internal states on average, the expectation parameter rises beliefs. And so that's going to be a major challenge is to go from these expectation and mean field approximations without going into error judicially. That is literally the whole challenge. The laplacian is like a quadratic that's fit on another distribution, which we're not even caring to learn the form of and so we could say that the expectation, the single number expectation, the expectation of a child in that class is five feet tall, but maybe it's all four and six feet."
"Speaker 1","01;59;42;25","02;00;13;09","But if we fit Laplacian on that, it's going to be at five looking like a quadratic. So the map and the territory are not the same and it is a significant challenge across domains to connect some of the approximations that are double edged swords. Like let's approximate over a bunch of possible futures or let's approximate this way like there's no free lunch."
"Speaker 1","02;00;13;26","02;00;42;18","So the internal states on average parameter rise beliefs, but does any given internal state parameter rise beliefs evolution kind of helps us out by saying like, well, on average it's going to get better and better. That's like the fundamental theorem of natural selection fitness sucks. And then the ones that don't do as well, the die. So evolution in a way helps us get out of this, but the formalism doesn't have that as we saw it right now."
"Speaker 1","02;00;42;28","02;00;43;22","Yeah, Steven on that."
"Speaker 3","02;00;44;18","02;01;17;08","That's a really good point. And so it also does tie into the so it gives a way to sort of the word average. But yeah, to average or approximate these faster perturbations, yet it still maintains perturbation means which could be used as a next nested level or in other ways. So it's so there's an interesting question. There's an interesting thing about, yeah, it's reducing and the, the, the overwhelming noise."
"Speaker 3","02;01;18;04","02;01;32;20","Yes. It's also not doing what traditional statistical averaging does, which is basically crash everything down to, you know, a fixed point. And it gives this ability for it still to be alive in a way."
"Speaker 1","02;01;33;04","02;02;04;25","Absolutely. Like if we just took the expectation, the single average point of the Lauren's attractor itself, it would just be one point in the middle of the saddle. OK, but we have something that still has a dynamical nature with a tractable approximation and the dynamics have a positively often of expense so we didn't squash the system down to a point or a racetrack."
"Speaker 1","02;02;05;12","02;02;20;12","We kept some of the dynamical and even chaotic aspects of the system while still being able to talk about things on average. But we're not talking about the average position of the particle. Yes, even quickly on that."
"Speaker 3","02;02;21;12","02;02;43;26","Yeah, I think that's a good point. And also just one thing that caught my mind is with that butterfly with the moth going to the flame is it talks about a perspective that's been taken yet. And this is probably useful when people are thinking in the apply that to inference. This is the perspective that we're having and it's possibly more use the word perspective because we see a picture of a moth."
"Speaker 3","02;02;44;06","02;03;02;12","If there was no picture there, we might say a description of the scenario, OK, so there's this perspective on the moth. Yet the moth isn't necessarily in this scenario taking a perspective, it's doing it's doing its own softness."
"Speaker 1","02;03;03;07","02;03;46;09","Yep. It's definitely moths going to moth, although the picture was not in the paper. I added that one but the snowflake was indeed in the 2006 paper. So let's just recap a few of the domains of implication and then we'll close because like what if on paper and discussion? So one implication, but also sort of note of caution is that just because we took the OG complex system Laurens and coupled it so two chess moves beyond some sort of simple scenario it doesn't mean that a synchronization map exists, let alone a good one for any given system."
"Speaker 1","02;03;46;23","02;04;17;19","But one of the implications of this paper was that now we know that for a nonzero subset of dynamical systems, a nonzero subset of chaotic dynamical systems and a nonzero subset of dynamical chaotic coupled systems, we can get this well behaved approximation map. So not to say all, but we know that the answer is now, not none. So that's a key implication."
"Speaker 1","02;04;19;05","02;04;48;06","Another implication was to really start to bring in the variation of free energy in terms of generalized synchrony. That's what opens up to the de Costa discrete state since space synthesis, acting inference, Bayesian surprise, optimal Bayesian design, intrinsic motivation info max risk sensitive policy is called control outcomes principle, decision theory, utility theory, max and construct or theory like this is not."
"Speaker 3","02;04;48;06","02;04;48;27","All."
"Speaker 1","02;04;49;15","02;05;36;10","In this paper. So a lot more has to be done to get to some of these places, especially in such a reasoned and bottom up way another implication of the paper is that they took the Helmholtz decomposition in a new way, and it might provide a generic generic model for random dynamical systems. Importantly, because we connected it so closely to Bayesian generative modeling it could be possible to do less, just like let's do descriptive analytics on flow to like let's have a map that we can run both ways where we're updating the parameters of our flow map with what we're observing."
"Speaker 1","02;05;36;19","02;06;03;28","But then we can also generate data sets, we can generate counterfactuals. And so that is what allows sparse data sets to play into active in FP and ties us more closely to modern machine learning like Variational Auto and coders another implication or next step would be like we were looking at a three dimensional system, the X, Y and Z of the Lauren's attractor."
"Speaker 1","02;06;04;20","02;06;37;04","But how could we approach high dimensional dynamical systems? So attractors in 50 dimensions that's a little bit different and hard to solve. So they suggest that a way to approach this probably hint, hint, cough, cough, wink, wink, et cetera, is to learn the state dependent flow operator and the ness using deep neural networks so it's kind of like you have a neural network now that recognizes balls."
"Speaker 1","02;06;37;28","02;06;57;06","And so we're still kind of keeping some of the same things that we had intuitive interpretation of in lower dimensions. It's just like you go like, OK, I know about the cube and then someone says, Well, there's like an 11 dimensional cube and you're OK, I kind of know what. I don't really see exactly what that means, but I kind of see what is being discussed."
"Speaker 1","02;06;57;18","02;07;36;26","How are we going to compute on the 11 dimensional cube though? Well, neural networks, and that is actually very close to neural stochastic differential equations, and I think this is super exciting. One could ergo hasn't been done. Probably hint, hint use a separate feedforward neural network to parametrized different components of the flow operator and self information. So in other words, we're taking what we talked about here and we can think about combining it with the types of stochastic differential equations, neural stochastic differential equations and Bayesian neural networks."
"Speaker 1","02;07;36;26","02;08;06;00","All of these advances in machine learning and now we're actually coming back to the table with new architectures for deep learning because this would be a deep learning model. It would have a deep neural network, you know, you would benefit from having a GPU, but it's an architecture that was inspired by the discussions that we had here. And then just the final implications, and then we'll just have a little closing the flows across the boundary."
"Speaker 1","02;08;06;16","02;08;56;09","Also notice that a little bit of a blanket starting to potentially be inched away from talking more about a Markov boundary and connecting the ATP to the construct or law and the work of Professor Adriane Bejan, who honestly is a lot like Christine in some ways and a really gracious person and communicator as well with a long career of working towards this kind of a unifying flow theory to get towards the evolution of design in nature and as the image shows that kind of like from floodplains to lung alveoli, that's similar kind of a unifying model and then a final set of implications is that we take co variances all the time from time series."
"Speaker 1","02;08;56;26","02;09;27;00","That's like how we do crypto trading, that's how we do weather prediction. That's all kinds of systems take covariance matrix on time series. And so potentially because the hessian is recapitulating elements of the covariance matrix, it could be possible to have an impure data set and empirically take the covariance and then learn something about the hessian, the curvature of the underlying flow states."
"Speaker 1","02;09;27;14","02;10;00;13","So in other words, if you use the laplacian approximation, even if it's stochastic, chaotic and dynamic, that empirical covariance could identify conditional in dependencies where there's a zero. And so in principle you could furnish a description of expected flow and the lyapunov excellence to establish whether the system was chaotic or not. Because we found that the hessian approximation gave us a lyapunov estimate that was like the actual the operative exponent in Lawrence system."
"Speaker 1","02;10;00;29","02;10;50;13","So we could go from empirical covariance, which people do literally every day c of open parentheses and our empirical covariance is two estimated hashes to estimates of things like the the option of excellence and that's why people often study chaotic systems in the super toy models like the Double Pendulum and Lawrence, because it turns out it's shockingly hard to find chaotic systems in nature outside of those toy examples, because the real noise in the system swamps your signal and so in conclusion, having a simple functional form for the flow of random dynamical systems may be useful for modeling and analyzing time series generated by real world processes that are far from equilibrium and may or"
"Speaker 1","02;10;50;13","02;11;16;05","may not be chaotic. And so that's the closing question. Human flow physical flow, supply chains, information flow, narrative flow, semantic flow, ants bringing seeds in and taking the mitten out. All of these flows we have data sets for them, and now we have a new kind of model that we can use to model those flows. So we'll just chill and talk for a few more minutes."
"Speaker 1","02;11;16;15","02;11;27;24","But what a great discussion. So thanks a lot, Dean and Steven and everybody else who participated in 32. So Steven, first deep breath."
"Speaker 3","02;11;29;06","02;12;26;03","Yeah, I there was a couple of things there that seems to have a big impact because as well as Markov humanism and the idea that active inference brings in this, this, this, this partitioning and the active inference field, which can then also have relationships to deep learning and how predictive process. And so about what's being said here that there's also evidence in or evidence the idea of the evidence and statistic chaos itself also being a paradigm paradigm symmetric part of evidence in being a both a B and being arrived at so which in some ways is not dependent purely on Markov humanism being the the the the overarching game in town."
"Speaker 3","02;12;26;27","02;12;57;22","So that is quite so that's quite an interesting additional way for the learning to be to be impacted by is this a field of practice? Is it a domain? I don't know what we call it, but that, that does, it does, it does make everything does it doesn't mean that it's all Markov humanism in terms of the ability to then infer."
"Speaker 3","02;12;58;03","02;13;36;06","You've also got this other ability to get information and from what you're saying it almost as much by inferring if there is chaotic presence or if there's no maybe not having maybe going and seeing if there's not chaos present may give an idea of there's maybe no correlations present and that's that's jumping the gun. But, you know, maybe there's other ways of being able to interrogate statistical dependencies in time series analysis that can be sitting alongside the Markov humanism."
"Speaker 1","02;13;39;11","02;14;07;26","So how that's going to Markov in modernism is definitely a good question. But yes, these are general tools for complex systems analysis. So I hope people don't read this paper as like first in apologetics or some sort of fringe developments in active only. It's pretty clear from the nouns that were used that this is actually like a fundamental contribution towards analyzing dynamical, stochastic, chaotic systems."
"Speaker 1","02;14;08;10","02;14;33;00","However, just because you find, for example, a low lyapunov exponents of your approximation, it's not a statement about the system. So we will always be able to just halt right there. You know, it's not that it's not a chaotic system. Your approximation doesn't have a chaotic leading lyapunov experts. So say what you want to say about your map."
"Speaker 1","02;14;33;00","02;14;52;24","Now, if your map isn't chaotic and you're doing a great job predicting, explaining, controlling, designing, creating wonderful, I hope the business is successful and that you can, you know, have friendship and health and all those things. But that's not a claim about the territory. And so there's going to be so many fun ways to talk and explore that."
"Speaker 1","02;14;53;24","02;14;56;05","Dean, what are your closing thoughts."
"Speaker 2","02;14;56;22","02;15;27;13","Just real quick, I think what the call variation piece, which is basically statistics and an abstraction to sort of explain things points out, is that if we can understand the world as being both within enveloped and between partitioned at the same time, that's a good fundamental place to start. And I completely agree with your last statement. We're not we're not counting fairies on pins and then just leaving it there."
"Speaker 2","02;15;27;14","02;15;45;16","We're actually hoping at some point to be able to turn this into something useful and functional. But if you can't if you can't start from a place of seeing it as two things at once within and between, you're going to struggle. You're going to tend to collapse prematurely and you're not going to get very creative and active inference will."
"Speaker 2","02;15;47;00","02;16;02;14","Well, you'll be able to define it and describe it, but I'm not sure how how much new information you'll be able to derive with it unless you can hold up both at once. It's within in between great."
"Speaker 1","02;16;02;25","02;16;34;00","There's so much more that we all have to learn the appendices, the formalisms, we then go into the citations, other perspectives, you know, it's just the beginning. And that's what data is about. Like how far we've come, you know, when we can go back to our road map and just be like, Wait, dynamical systems and densities. And then we're, you know, 300 miles past there, but where have we gotten?"
"Speaker 1","02;16;34;14","02;16;52;20","And so it's like just really exciting. And I'm glad that we're doing it in a participatory way because there's a lot to it. So, Dean and Stephen, thank you again, everybody watching live and in replay. Hope that you get involved and stay involved with Active Lab. See you later."
"Speaker 1","02;16;54;23","02;16;55;02","Bye."
