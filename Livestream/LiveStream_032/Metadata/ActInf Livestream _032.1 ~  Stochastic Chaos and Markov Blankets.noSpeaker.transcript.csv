"Unknown","00;00;33;00","00;01;05;18","Hello and welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is Active Lab Livestream number 32.1321. Stochastic Chaos and Mark Blankets. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is learning, communicating and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at some of the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work."
"Unknown","00;01;06;11","00;01;36;08","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams. At this short link, you can see some of the past, present, and upcoming live streams we are here in the early November 20th 2132 discussions on stochastic chaos and markup like it's and in the second half of November we'll be talking about the paper thinking like a state and we haven't yet set the papers for 34 and 35."
"Unknown","00;01;36;08","00;02;10;06","So if you have any ideas or if you're an author you want to come on to discuss for these states then get in touch with us today in active stream 32.1. The goal is to learn and discuss this extremely interesting paper stochastic chaos and Markov blankets buy first in Haines also offer to Costa and PA from 2021 and there's a lot to cover in this paper there's a lot of formalisms and figures and keywords and broader questions."
"Unknown","00;02;10;13","00;02;45;04","So I'm sure we'll have a lot to think about and discuss If you're watching live, then please feel free to write a question in the chat because otherwise Steven and I are just chilling here so let's get into it with just intros and warm ups and if others join, we'll have them introduce themselves when they do join. But for now, let's just say hello and maybe bring up just something that excited us about coming to this discussion or something that we wanted to resolve today."
"Unknown","00;02;45;23","00;03;15;27","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California and something that I liked or remembered about the paper was that there was seemingly some changes or updates to the formalism of core terms. And so how to understand that in the broader trajectory of the literature, which one of these changes are like updates where is it a software update? Where is it a breaking change?"
"Unknown","00;03;16;09","00;03;56;27","And then what are the implications of those changes for some of the broader conclusions that people do or want to draw from active inference and the like, the nature of thickness or biological systems or levels of nested organization. So Stephen. Yes, good morning from Toronto. I'm Stephen and I'm doing a practice based Ph.D. which is kind of moves into a methods based Ph.D. I work a lot with group processes and working with spatial creative spatial approaches to help do sense making."
"Unknown","00;03;58;04","00;04;45;03","So I'm really interested in active inference within that as a as a kind of unifying way to help to close a lot of the loops and the fragmented questions that come up when trying to do sense making with different types of people in different types of spaces. So yeah, as with Daniel, I'm really interested about this paper as after the initial view of it, because you see stochastic chaos and you know, I'm consciously trying to not go too far down a sort of an abstract or academic aspects of things but I realize that actually these underlying processes have got quite a lot of applications in this ability to understand why and how things are unifying."
"Unknown","00;04;46;18","00;05;22;16","And I think that's really exciting because there's a lot of sort of seminal cohesion that looks at larger cognitive processes, the setting practices and the activist processes. But what we tend to see when it gets down to the nitty gritty is it's how are things bubbling up through the kind of stochastic chaos of the world and life, or should I just say stochastic, separated, chaotic processes."
"Unknown","00;05;22;16","00;05;45;29","And so the idea of having stochastic chaos and what that means and this paper does that is quite useful to start to look at what it means to have to be able to reconcile those approaches. So it actually does start to help think about more applied approaches. So that's something I'm I'm interested and excited about this paper. Thank you, Steven."
"Unknown","00;05;46;22","00;06;17;18","In the 32.0, this is kind of the lead in was this topic of flow. And that is in a way what might start to bridge this distinction that you raised and will definitely return to between kind of abstractions and applications. Flow is a term that has applications across domains from the flow of water, flow of people, flow of information and money to psychological flow."
"Unknown","00;06;17;22","00;06;55;00","It's kind of a nomadic term it's a transdisciplinary term. And then that's an abstraction we're abstracting to the patterns of flow that help us connect the dots across these different systems. But also we want to apply it. We don't just want to say, well, water is flow and information is flow, and that's the end of the story. So how abstractions and applications kind of work like the left and the right foot together to build our knowledge and our application, almost like our epistemic and our pragmatic value."
"Unknown","00;06;55;11","00;07;29;15","I think that'll be a thread that's important to pull out. What do you think about that? Yeah, that's a really helpful connection, and I think this also speaks to that usefulness of this work beyond modeling directly is when when this idea of flows talked about in, in these ways is kind of a bit vague, right? It's kind of and it still has this idea of things flowing in a certain direction and are you in the flow?"
"Unknown","00;07;29;15","00;07;59;17","And so I think when we start to also have the potential for stochastic processes and in a way the sense that everything's flow and how does what does low and high requirements mean? You know, what does low and high competencies preferences mean? And they kind of these are quite bucket terms, right? And essentially they are what they are because they're workable truth be told."
"Unknown","00;08;00;04","00;08;38;12","But, you know, we can start to look for something which can hold things in a more unified way because I think that the way that we might feel in the flow when we're in a zone where we can both do things and we're immersed in it, may may well be maybe what we're in all the time anyway. But it's just a different form of so that that also changes you know, the kind of ramifications out there great point."
"Unknown","00;08;38;12","00;09;08;16","And we can actually connect that to this sort of view from the outside and view from the inside, which we talk about a lot in active. So it's almost like there's the skier going down the hill and the view from the outside, the behavioral view is like given the angle of the hill, they're optimally flowing. That river is physically optimally flowing down that hill, as you'd expect from the friction and the potential energy and just the physics of the setup."
"Unknown","00;09;09;05","00;09;33;10","And then there's this internal experience of flow. So it's kind of like maybe we are in flow all the time, even when we are getting, for example, distracted or bored or frustrated. In what ways is that still flow because if we think about flow, it flows good. You know, it's a state where we're productive and happy and things like that, and then we're out of flow."
"Unknown","00;09;33;16","00;09;57;16","That's what you'd hear in the psychological literature. But let's just say that the river we're flowing and flooding, we don't say, Well, we're done using flow models because now it doesn't do what I thought it was going to do. Flow is the whole space. So how do we think about this whole psychological space as being particular regimes? Of flow and flows?"
"Unknown","00;09;57;16","00;10;38;04","The big topic that connects stress, fear, feeling overwhelmed, concern, excitation, et cetera, those are all flow states. Maybe it's not the flow state that we expect, maybe not the one that we prefer, but a river can have flow states that we don't expect or prefer either. And so it's like when we do abstract to the physical systems, we get a whole quantitative toolkit and we also get the ability to maybe look beyond phrasings that see flow as just something to be obtained and rather flow as the nature of perhaps interior experience and then we can talk about designing or perturbing regimes of flow."
"Unknown","00;10;38;10","00;11;07;15","Yeah, good. Yeah, that's a good point because from the out there's the outside system like say seeing someone skiing down a hill and you can say there's different ways of doing that. And then there's from the inside, you've got essentially a dynamic, non-linear dynamic or organism. And this kind of transitions thrive and survive and that is different. There's no getting away from that."
"Unknown","00;11;07;15","00;11;28;17","And the nature of that difference is that. So that's another question. Villains. But the interesting thing is on that graph as well is often that graph only the flow is only shown on the top, right? And not on the bottom left, even though it could be seen to flow down and so some of that, it's like a quadrant and it's just the top right, which is seen as the flow."
"Unknown","00;11;29;23","00;12;11;29","But what's also interesting is it kind of depends again on these multi scale dynamics. OK, so within certain scales of and temporal scales, things start to fit are are organisms, preferred states, some of which is kind of built into our morphology. So, you know, if something becomes so easy, for instance, it's a lot easier if I'm trying to protect a building just to stand in front of the front door as a security guard and nothing happens all day."
"Unknown","00;12;12;27","00;12;59;29","But I may end up in some sort of flow, but there's a point at which there's a desire for some stimulation and there's a desire for some change. And there's also maybe changes that happen at the kind of this. So it ties in with having several Adams that friends work about, you know, windows of experience both in real time and over time is when is it kind of in the same sort of time scales that we consciously function in and when is something beyond that, you know, so that could be where stress and boredom or stress and burnout can be both because the nature of the activity is it's too rapid, it's too disjointed for"
"Unknown","00;12;59;29","00;13;32;13","the morphology or it may be that we perceive it that way because we have some, you know, depressive depression or anxiety that's also not enabling us to engage in those ways. What's your thoughts? Great. Let's take that points to one of the formalisms of the paper. So you just mentioned how there's like multiple all time scales and there might be slower time scales as well as faster ones, which might even be faster than our rate of perception or modeling, which are one in the same."
"Unknown","00;13;32;13","00;14;04;12","If perception is indeed a generative model, and this is very early in the paper in section two, from dynamics to densities so they write the aim of this section is to get from the specification of a random dynamical system in terms of its equations of motion. So the for example, differential equations that define the time evolution of a dynamical system to the probability density over its states in the long term future from any initial conditions."
"Unknown","00;14;04;25","00;14;46;00","So going from dynamical systems, which takes us into the temporal realm to the density realm. And so there we think about ocean water of different physical densities. There's a motion to the densities because denser things go down. And so that idea of denser things going down or flow from high to low density regions, just like in the atmosphere, just like in the ocean, that is going to be connected to the behavior of random dynamical systems and to information geometry."
"Unknown","00;14;46;15","00;15;13;24","So that's a little bit of the next piece. But the two timescales are here. Here's a classic flow model. There's a flow, and then there's the fast fluctuations. So it's like there's the river moving ahead at one kilometer per hour, but each molecule in that river is not always going at exactly that speed rates. There's a fast fluctuation which might average out to zero."
"Unknown","00;15;14;00","00;15;41;27","So in the bulk aggregate or in the time aggregate, the flow dominates the behavior of the river, but the fast fluctuations are also occurring and they can often be equivalent to a well behaved Gaussian error term. So this is where we see the separation of timescales into sort of the flow of the river and then the vibration of the molecules."
"Unknown","00;15;43;02","00;16;11;05","And those have two different partitioning of the system. The flow is well behaved because it is just like a single number for the whole river in the simple example. And the fast fluctuations are well behaved because they're smaller. If they were larger than the flow they would become the flow itself. So they're smaller than the flow and they might be uncorrelated or have a zero mean which allows us to do Gaussian statistics on them."
"Unknown","00;16;11;18","00;16;49;05","And then this idea of separation to slow and fast time scales is connected to density dynamics through the Focker plank equation. Yeah. Steven Yeah. Just a little question on that. So this this time dynamic. So flow is both. It's the time scale of interest, I suppose you could say, and potentially one which has a net kind of change in some sort of directional kind of gradient descent, I suppose."
"Unknown","00;16;49;20","00;17;22;22","And then the fast fluctuation ins, it's it doesn't say random, but it's probably more stochastic but could also have flows going on. So is this is this, is this, you know, how, how much difference in the rate do they need to be to be classed as good and fast? Good question. So the X with a dot is kind of like the derivative of X."
"Unknown","00;17;22;22","00;17;48;10","It's the rate of change in X, it's the flow in X is going to be decomposed to these two terms. Now, we might be interested in a very special solution to this equation. So again, we have X dot is kind of the change in X which is being broken down to these two dynamical variables. And then that's being equivalent to the Focker plank, which is more of a density framing."
"Unknown","00;17;48;10","00;18;15;22","So that's the key introductory step in the paper is just to build this really strong equivalence arc there the same picture between the dynamical specification and the density specification. So if we could solve when the dynamics were at a steady point, that would be equivalent to when the density would be at a steady point. There might be some methods to help solve it in one phrasing or the other phrasing."
"Unknown","00;18;16;14","00;18;51;25","It turns out that there's a way to solve with a little bit more feasibility when P of X equals zero. So that's when the flow the density flow given this is zero. And so that's what they're discussing here is basically asking when does that equal zero? And that is a stationary point. So it's kind of like doesn't mean it's just simply flat in the reservoir."
"Unknown","00;18;51;27","00;19;25;07","But, you know, there's a pump bringing water up to the reservoir at ten gallons per minute and then the reservoir is dumping at ten gallons per minute. Then that is going to be a point where there's a station parity in the overall densities of those two bodies of water, just like if it were two bodies of heat. And so we're solving for a special place, which is where the total flow rate is zero Can I just ask a question without going to deeper?"
"Unknown","00;19;25;23","00;20;05;22","So in a way, the, the, the flows the ability of having this relationship to the flow is it gives it gives you a sense, I suppose you could say, is that when the graph the the gradient zero you know, at the top of a graph between two types of the sentence and it this it's got like that that flat gradient, it gives you a chance to choose moments which could have a particular set of properties without having to calculate everything about it is just and I said they say so and now when that happens what happens then is it then that you then measure the density and just keep measuring lots of density points when"
"Unknown","00;20;05;22","00;20;38;17","you find the flow points to be it at a state of equilibrium or is it something else? It's a very good question. Taking samples and using that to say something about the landscape is something we are going to get to welcome Dean. So we will talk about how samples can be empirically taken to say things and do inference on the flow density but you made a good point, which is that like we want to figure out something about a special point."
"Unknown","00;20;38;18","00;20;57;16","Like let's just say that we knew that we were solving for a quadratic equation which is going to come into play later, so it is going to look like a ball now. It'd be awesome to know every single point on the whole ball, but it turns out we might only be interested or mostly interested in one point the bottom of the ball."
"Unknown","00;20;58;06","00;21;24;13","And for a quadratic function, the bottom of the ball is the only time that the derivative is zero. So we can have this big, nasty quadratic equation and then take the derivative of it the first derivative, and then just ask when does the first derivative the slope of the curve equal zero? And we know that for a quadratic equation, there's only one point where that happens."
"Unknown","00;21;24;13","00;21;59;04","And either it's like a ball or it's like an upside down ball. But because we constrained the discussion to a specific family, of equations, which is going to be important for variational inference, we can then solve some very reduced equations like the derivative, which is of a lower order of computational complexity, and then just get the one point that we actually wanted, which is like the location of the bottom of the ball, and then from the bottom of the ball and some of the coefficient estimates that we have, we actually do get the whole ball."
"Unknown","00;21;59;22","00;22;32;26","So this is kind of like we're taking some big family of equations and then we're going to be looking for special points, like especially where the flow is at equilibrium or stationary and then fitting a family of equations with a form that we know we can compute with to approximate a flow that has a different underlying dynamic and that is going to come into play where they show very early."
"Unknown","00;22;33;03","00;23;06;22","You can take a Lorenzo tractor, which has some equations that govern its motion. So again, those can be moved from the equations of motion to the density dynamics. And then you can reconstruct an approximation of its dynamics and you're approximation to the dynamics doesn't have to be even of the same form as the generative process itself. So it's like you could fit a linear model between height and weight with some error, but that doesn't mean that there is a linear model relating height and weight."
"Unknown","00;23;07;01","00;23;37;01","It just means it's an approximation here, a stick with a form that's very easy to solve. Steven. And then welcome Dean. Feel free to add anything you like you say. So in some ways this is a bit like that particle wave challenge whereby you know, you have to use a particle. So find where something is in time, in space, you have to use a very simplified understanding of the wave to say, OK, at this point I have to, I can't, I can't have all the other information."
"Unknown","00;23;37;01","00;24;13;15","But to have my location information even if it's an informational location. So it's like the flow. Finding the point in the flow gives you a way to identify the location, maybe in the information space. And then the Focker plank gives you a way to then embellish that with another type of, you know, put information back in in a way back into that, into the cake mix a bit more, you know, a bit more so and a few more chocolate chocolate buttons in there."
"Unknown","00;24;13;15","00;24;49;25","And so you can see what's going on. OK, that's quite useful to think about that. Would I be right in the sense of like what those two equations are doing, one's giving you OK, some chance to two to choose a moment in information space or physical space. So they should got something too. And then the other one is giving you a way to then put some information in which you can then start to do some variational processing on all, give a short thought, and then Dean and Blue, feel free to say hello and just any overall thoughts and take it wherever you want to go."
"Unknown","00;24;51;04","00;25;27;02","Most dynamical systems have been framed classically using these equations of motion. So you get like a matrix that describes the differential equations that describe the unfolding of the Lorentz attractor. So it's framed as a series of dynamical equations so this early equivalence allows us to bring some of the tools of fluid mechanics and density dynamics and flow to bear on these dynamical systems."
"Unknown","00;25;28;16","00;26;23;04","So there are some ingredients or some kitchen tools that make approximations to flow very useful for equations of motion that might be intractable if you try to solve it on just that domain, like figuring out a chaotic systems underlying generative process, it's basically not possible, but potentially by approximating it with a very specific type of approximation, families of functions that we know have certain behaviors which we're going to talk more about using approximation families that are well behaved and using some of the things that have been developed from flow decomposition like the Helmholtz decomposition that doesn't exist for dynamical systems."
"Unknown","00;26;23;21","00;26;58;09","So by making that equivalence between dynamical systems and flowing systems, we can then use flow tools to study dynamical systems, as well as making it clear that we're describing the flow of our approximation. But it turns out that that does pretty well, at least in some of these examples that they're going to present in the paper. So Dean and then Blue, I again, I wasn't going to come on today, but the conversation was stimulating enough."
"Unknown","00;26;58;09","00;27;26;27","I figured I had to jump in here and maybe add my $0.02 at some point. Thanks. And blue. Hi, I'm Blue. I'm a research assistant in New Mexico, and I was into this paper because it's I don't know, kind of it's my interest in information geometry. And Daniel, I saw like in the dot zero that you mentioned that course that's online."
"Unknown","00;27;26;27","00;27;46;01","I'm like going to look into that for sure. And, you know, I'm curious about like a lot of the leaps that were maybe made in this paper between like particles from particles to cells and back to particles again. And those kinds of transitions get a little fuzzy for me. So I'm curious to see kind of where this flows to."
"Unknown","00;27;47;05","00;28;12;26","Yep. I think that was the information geometry course of John Bayes. So that's like again, I haven't taken that, but I know that that's recommended and very cool. So we talked a little bit about flow about that's kind of one of the dreams that we could have a unified flow model for heat and people information, behavior, strategy, et cetera."
"Unknown","00;28;14;06","00;28;41;16","And one of the earliest moves that they do in the paper is just to really lock down this connection between dynamical systems systems through time and systems with density. So it's worth just repeating that because that's the second section of the paper and that's going to be a lot of the buildup. Another term that comes into play is the Lyapunov exponent and chaotic systems."
"Unknown","00;28;42;03","00;29;19;24","So if anyone has a thought, of course just raise your hand. But one way that chaotic is quantified and formalized, this doesn't mean it's the only sense of the word chaotic because sometimes people do use it non technically. But the technical definition of chaotic is referring to the extent of the sensitivity of the system to small changes, for example, in initial conditions or in perturbations and so there's what's known as the opposite exponent, which is something that can be calculated from the model of a dynamical system."
"Unknown","00;29;20;15","00;29;45;05","And there are some dynamical systems where adjacent points stay adjacent. So it's like two pieces of wood that are just put in a river that's moving straight forward. There's other systems where adjacent points converge or where adjacent points diverge, and it depends where you are in the system. Like if you're at the bottom of the ball, then the either way you go, it's like a stable equilibrium are going to get pushed back in."
"Unknown","00;29;45;21","00;30;19;24","But if the ball were upside down, then either points to the side of the top of the ball would push you and diverge. So that's the operative exponent and there's a lot of technical detail in exploring chaotic systems from this perspective. So that's one matrix term that comes into play is using the lyapunov exponents, especially the leading lyapunov exponents to characterize some of the attributes of a system."
"Unknown","00;30;20;04","00;31;02;14","Stephen Then you start to mention the idea of a system, you know, two things coming together and when they can meet, you know the system as well, they can converge or they diverge, but they could also when they bump into each other, there's also that the dynamics of the system. So there's both the systems dynamics merging, the dynamics of the change, it will stop changing once they make it rain so that there's also that extra level of dynamical change which you get with these nonlinear dynamical systems which are actually working with the dynamics of the change."
"Unknown","00;31;02;21","00;31;50;14","So it can sort of reset itself. It's not like with one say in a physical system, they've they've come together. That's kind of it. When you did move variations on change, it becomes much more generative OK, yes. So sometimes these exquisite sensitivities to tiny, tiny differences in initial conditions, they get swamped by random fluctuations so that's what's interesting about their approach here is again, they're partitioning out the flow from the fast fluctuations and then they're describing how when when random fluctuations are added in, then the strange attractor is going to be retraced by replaced by a pullback attractor."
"Unknown","00;31;51;12","00;32;30;07","And then the flow is the expected motion. So that's the movement of the river of the flow term. If this flow shows exponential divergence of trajectories, i.e. positively opposite of exponents, we can impute stochastic chaos they then use this approach to investigate one of the classic chaotic systems, which has also been one of the earliest chaotic systems of Lorenz, who maybe there were some other livestream where we did a little bit more on the lower ends."
"Unknown","00;32;30;07","00;32;55;26","But it was a meteorology question. Lorenzo and colleagues were studying the weather and how it changes, and about some of the sensitivity of the dynamical models to tiny changes. Like it seems like if it's, you know, 21.1 C, it seems like that should be very similar in its behavior in the long run to it being just one degree higher."
"Unknown","00;32;56;15","00;33;21;11","And then as you got further away, it's like, well, then it'd be way more different in the future if it's more different today. But then it could actually turn out that a tiny difference ends up sending your equations haywire, whereas a very different initial condition might actually like feedback and come back to a similar attractor through time. So that's the kind of systems that they were investigating in like the 1950s."
"Unknown","00;33;21;25","00;33;49;21","And there's been a lot of computer and technical work since then. But this is still a total classic and a beautiful, strange attractor for them to be working on. As the first example in their paper, Steven So from what you're saying, the, the strange attractor is the kind of complexity science idea of these mathematical models where things get caught in, as you just described in initial conditions."
"Unknown","00;33;49;21","00;34;26;08","Can can change the nature of what that becomes within a certain range and obviously outside that range, it doesn't, it doesn't form. So it's still kind of off equilibrium this pull back attractor is a is it's almost a set of states which can be moved towards through looking at the flows within other types of chaotic attractors. So it's making a difference."
"Unknown","00;34;26;08","00;35;03;27","So it's in some ways a strange attracts. So the pull back attractor would need or involve some sort of inference or some sort of some sort of drive to make it happen is not inherent to this, to the nature of the mathematics of that particular thing. Once you let it roll, would I be right in that? So the pull back attractor, it's kind of like, let's just imagine the attractor is like a post in the ground and there's a bungee cord so if we were looking at that quadratic ball, it'd be like there's an attractor at the bottom of the ball."
"Unknown","00;35;04;06","00;35;23;01","And then if all you saw was the lateral movement of the particle. So we don't know anything about the height necessarily or the shape of the graph. We just observe that when we push the ball to the left it gets pulled back as if it's being on a bungee cord, pulled, left, maybe it even overshoots and kind of dampens."
"Unknown","00;35;23;14","00;35;53;05","So that's like a pull back attractor to a point attractor. What's being shown here is an attractor that is in higher dimensions. So if you had a two dimensional pull back attractor, it'd be like the line Y equals X, and if you get perturbed off the line, you come back down into the valley. So that's like where you start to see vector fields and the flow of water into a river and now we're in a three dimensional attractor, at least three spatial dimensions."
"Unknown","00;35;53;23","00;36;23;00","And so it's kind of like there's a a race car going around this butterfly track and then it has the bungee cord. So you're getting pulled to this car that's moving. And then if you sample your location at different times, you're being drawn to a pull back attractor, which is the compromise between the flow as defined by the equations of motions of Lorenz attractor and the fast stochastic fluctuations."
"Unknown","00;36;23;18","00;36;56;19","Dean and then Stephen Now, just quickly, I think this is why sometimes using a the metaphor of building a bridge is difficult because not all not all times is as convenient as the lowest energy state in a bowl. Sometimes what we have to look at is the fact that at one end, call it point a we're trying to figure out what point B is, and it isn't always the lowest energy state."
"Unknown","00;36;56;19","00;37;29;03","I think here's an example. So if you ever if you've been to Hudson Yards in New York, it's a fascinating translation of a space over time. And it and if you were to ask the people who actually constructed those high trestles at the at the point that they were built, if you did that, if you had asked them X number of years later whether or not that was going to be the lowest possible energy state or attractor state, I don't think they could have predicted that."
"Unknown","00;37;30;00","00;37;55;18","And so that's why I think it's difficult at times when we for the sake of convenience, for effort to expedite our sense of what's going to happen next. We use a connector metaphor, but in fact, that's not exactly what stochastic possibility is about. So what we tend to do is collapse down too quickly, down to the particulars of what purpose a product can serve."
"Unknown","00;37;56;08","00;38;26;08","And we if we're going to build a bridge from a product to a process, which is what I think looking at stochastic separation is about, we should maybe drop the idea of a static connector and maybe look at the back and forth and the actual dynamics of those dynamic situations, which were now the tool of active inference affords you interesting."
"Unknown","00;38;26;08","00;38;46;20","It just made me think about like throwing a Frisbee and it catches on a roof that's its lowest local energy state. But if you just thought about gravity, maybe you'd say, well, it's going to fall to the ground. So one particular trajectory may not realize the ultimate lowest energy state yet. In a way, it's in its own energy state."
"Unknown","00;38;47;06","00;39;15;17","So Stephen, yeah, so thinking about applications, I think what David mentioned is a good point is there's a natural tendency to want to have that kind of bridge between two stable things. The thing with two stable things is it is there stable, as we just mentioned. So therefore, if you're trying to get information about variations within them, particularly chaotic variations, you're not going to get much."
"Unknown","00;39;15;27","00;39;42;00","Right. So you kind of need this doesn't a need to be off out of equilibrium to to give the conditions where things can move in potentially a strange attractor or potentially other types of, you know, solenoid or flow or something. There needs to be some way for flows to happen. And then within that which I think that might explain why that last graph."
"Unknown","00;39;42;00","00;40;14;11","So if I'm if I'm right in thinking that those photographs that you showed there and kind of showing that you've got this strange fact that you can sort of look at the same space using points of where something has become moment momentarily zero in the flow calculation gives you a zero. So you can then for take a point and then the bottom right is basically saying you can recapitulate that as a global potential."
"Unknown","00;40;14;11","00;40;26;15","So you can sort of by taking the changes that happen in the second order, you can sort of recapitulate some kind of understanding of the structure of the information. Is that right?"
"Unknown","00;40;29;14","00;41;11;20","There's a lot there. It so I cannot reduce it to a binary, but yes, it is showing different aspects of how strange attractors which are found in these sort of exotic deterministic chaos systems like a perfectly clean double pendulum. And then how when we take the approximation, we find a pullback attractor empirically in the approximation. So now we're describing a nicer, still stochastic, but much nicer and more approachable pullback attractor like it's being pulled back to some butterfly shape."
"Unknown","00;41;12;05","00;41;48;04","Now we don't get these like rings of Jupiter situation from our sampling because we're taking particular samples and we're fitting then a flow, what flow generated those samples. So we never see rings of Jupiter's strange attractor. We're dealing with approximations of random attractors and then we have at least two tools slash helpful techniques to apply that are going to help us come to terms with that approximation."
"Unknown","00;41;48;18","00;42;20;19","So one of them is we're dealing with flow so we can talk about the Helmholtz decomposition. So this was discussed a lot in Active 26 and as mentioned in the zero stochastic Chaos and Marco Blankets was submitted like a few weeks after 26 was submitted Bayesian mechanics. So the Helmholtz decomposition describes this partitioning into the ear rotational kind of the gradient put putting the ruler on the hill."
"Unknown","00;42;20;19","00;42;44;22","What is the angle of the ruler if you're on the top of the hill it's flat if you're on the hill it's going to be at an angle. So separating that ruler on the hill to the hiking map, the ISO contour so let's make the ruler flat wherever it is, whatever the slope is, and then let's just take that ruler and kind of move it side to side as we go around this hill."
"Unknown","00;42;45;08","00;43;06;27","Now, if you're on the very top of the hill, then the ruler is flat and there's no ISO contour. But if you're anywhere else on that whole landscape other than a local maxima, there's going to be some angle to the ruler and some way to get around the hill. So that's the Helmholtz decomposition so that's one piece that we get to bring to the puzzle."
"Unknown","00;43;07;10","00;43;38;11","And then one piece that would be interesting to ask the authors or someone with more technical experience is we've seen the Helmholtz decomposition before into the solenoid in the gradient components. But then there's this housekeeping term. You know, capital lambda, and that's described in an appendix and it gets quite technical, but it has to do with the density landscape changing as a function of flow."
"Unknown","00;43;39;04","00;44;06;16","So it's not just like we're going to have one mountain topography and then we're going to have rain falling on that one mountain. There's going to be some changes as we flow around so that it's more like, you know, you have a jet of hot water into a cold water. You can't just take the the mountain of temperature and then just ask, well, what happens if we pour hot water on top of that mountain?"
"Unknown","00;44;07;03","00;44;54;11","Because the mountain is actually changing. The landscape is changing as a function of the flow. And some of that gets incorporated into this housekeeping term. So one tool that we have is from the flow toolkit is the Helmholtz decomposition into these different components that help us reconstruct a flow that is a much better approximation. Steven, now, you mentioned there that we've seen solenoid and gradient before with Helmholtz decomposition when you say we've seen it before, we saying we've seen it more recently with the solenoid to work or is the solenoid open in there with like this was dropped sleeping, craving out?"
"Unknown","00;44;55;15","00;45;28;21","Oh yeah. Like we've discussed it in paper number 26 and other papers like this is not a novel partitioning by the authors and it's very linked to other discussions that we've had about Helmholtz decomposition in the context of distributional approximation. Yeah, but previously was it was more of a focus on gradient descent. The focus was in your regime of attention potentially, but it was, it was there OK, right."
"Unknown","00;45;28;21","00;46;05;18","Going way back to early days OK. OK, so, so in, just out in the, in that paper that was looking at Southern water flow, it was it was it was giving more weight to that, wasn't it? Would you say it was given more weight or was it using that in a different explanatory way? Because there has been this shift around solenoid or flow to give another way beyond electricity to explain how these dynamics can work they're kind of co instantiated because they're partitioning from each other of the same underlying model."
"Unknown","00;46;05;21","00;46;33;09","So which one is emphasized more is totally a question of situation and flourish. But it also may be the case that over the previous three years, there's more of an emphasis on the importance of the ISO contours in complex problem solving as opposed to just run and gun gradient descent so I agree with that. So that's one tool we have."
"Unknown","00;46;33;10","00;47;00;11","OK, so we do the Helmholtz decomposition because again, we're making this deep equivalence between dynamical systems and flow systems. So one tool we have from the flow world is the Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields now they write in Section 31, our objective is to identify the functional form. So could be used in the sense like what function does it play?"
"Unknown","00;47;00;11","00;47;33;04","Or a functional is like a function of a function, a functional form of the self information or potential function that describes the non equilibrium, steady state density. OK, so we go back to in three, the fancy I, the fancy J, they write the first Disappear Apart performs a Romanian gradient descent on a manifold on the negative logarithm of the steady state density, which can be interpreted as the self information of any given state or as some potential function."
"Unknown","00;47;33;18","00;47;52;16","So this is how surprised should I be to be in this state? So now let's go back to our bowl. You shouldn't be surprised if you're at the bottom. You should be surprised if you're at the top. There's high potential. Now, if it were gravity that were pulling us down, that would be a potential energy gravitational potential energy."
"Unknown","00;47;52;29","00;48;26;22","You have higher gravitational potential energy that can get dissipated. Free energy can be dissipated if you have greater potential energy. So we want something that is just like you could have the ball and the ball and know where's the ball expected to be and where is it going to roll down from? Where is there potential that's high and where is the potential low and then here in FIG. one, they're going to plot self information on the bottom left."
"Unknown","00;48;27;02","00;48;51;24","That's the wax self information. And then there's that is fluctuating through time as the system is cranked. It's kind of like if the self information were state, we're staying at a constant value. It'd be like if you're in that race car going around the track, then you're always where you expect to be because again, the ball is like a point attractor and then the Lorenz approximation is going to be to a dynamical approximation."
"Unknown","00;48;52;12","00;49;28;23","So we want to find the function of the non equilibrium steady state that's going to be describing how surprised you should be the potential function for that system. So these are big questions like how is the self information measured or calculated? And then what does it mean for the self information to be high or low? And how does the self information for different states that we might care about like homeostasis, how does the self information in those cases differ?"
"Unknown","00;49;29;00","00;50;00;04","Like is the self information higher or lower when homeostatic li you're in a good attractor. So Dean and Steven OK, so I don't know this, but I would guess that on some basic level the measure is on its most absolute terms, greater or less than to begin with because I think that that that relative difference is something that anybody doesn't even have to be aware of consciously calculating."
"Unknown","00;50;00;18","00;50;29;15","They can just you're kind of, you can kind of tell, but I'm not really sure. But I would think that as as we as we go up in terms of the, the determination and the accuracy of the measure, we would we could find ourselves getting more precise. But on the most basic level, I would think it would from a functional standpoint, that's where we would have to begin I guess."
"Unknown","00;50;29;15","00;50;59;10","And having being less surprised about the state that one is in, entails having a richer and a more accurate generative self model. So if you have a model that just totally off base, you're going to be recurrently surprised. If you have a very nuanced self model, your location and your circadian rhythm, then different observations will be less surprising."
"Unknown","00;51;00;15","00;51;26;27","Yeah, I was just reading back what you were saying because you did a really good explanation that the way in your explanation that the key thing was I should be more surprised or I should be less surprised that you, you yourself and doing the explanation come back to that basic difference. That's so again, as we get more precise, I think we can we can have more sophisticated ways of being able to show how we arrived there."
"Unknown","00;51;27;00","00;51;56;15","But at the beginning, even a two year old can somehow tell the difference between more and less that's why they dig in their heels. Right. So it seems like on that basic level, before we get into some of the more sophisticated stuff, we all can, it says addresses these questions for one simple case. I think on its simplest terms, that's where we can probably start we can look there first."
"Unknown","00;51;56;16","00;52;22;17","If that's not available. I don't know that other math matters. I know it does. But to the person who can't see that first, I'm not sure where they go. This past weekend, we were hanging out with some lava with some children, and we were really struck by how there would be some times where it seemed like you just would tell them something totally different, like switch topic in the middle of a sentence, and they just went along with it."
"Unknown","00;52;23;04","00;52;40;23","And then other times where they needed something really specific, like they wanted that piece of food and they want it in this part of the plate and they want to touch it this way. And so it's like they have a generative model and there's certain parts that they're surprised by or not. And so we're just like, we want that piece of food."
"Unknown","00;52;40;23","00;53;03;07","And I'm not too surprised at the route it takes to my plate. But if their generative model entails a specific way that that is going to get to their plate, they're going to be surprised by anything other than that. And if they don't have a generative model of topics in the world, then switching topics and talking about this event in a mad event, it's just like it's as if any other set of topics were addressed."
"Unknown","00;53;03;16","00;53;34;26","So great point about our intuitive connection to surprising information, how that's related to our generative modeling so blue. And then Stephen so just to go to your child model, like having had lots of kids around for a lot of time, you know, food is something particularly that they like fixate on, right? I mean, I my younger stepdaughter is like one of the easiest kids ever."
"Unknown","00;53;34;26","00;53;52;05","Like she's so chill and so laid back. But like I remember when she was about two years old, she would like freak out at one time. I cut I cut an apple for her, like sliced it up, you know, just to make it look easy to eat. And she got so mad because she wanted the whole apple, the whole thing, and she thought I was only going to giving her a part of it."
"Unknown","00;53;52;05","00;54;10;11","But I think maybe food is I mean, my point is I'm rambling with the story, but maybe food is one of these things that that is like so baked in to our generative model because otherwise the children have an attention span of a gnat. Like, you know, you're in the car and they start to argue and you just say, oh, look at that pretty yellow car right there."
"Unknown","00;54;10;18","00;54;28;27","And then they're done there over it. Like, so, so generally like you can surprise the child and completely shift them. But when it comes to food, it's like this weird. And many kids like that. Just ask them with the apple. But then there's also like this food can't touch that food. And like they have a bigger piece of cake than me and all this stuff."
"Unknown","00;54;28;27","00;54;48;29","So, so this food, like this fundamental like baked in thing that's like central to survival and therefore it's like very deeply ingrained in our generative model maybe. Nice. Agree. Stephen Yeah. Sort of the idea of children. I'll keep that analogy in there."
"Unknown","00;54;51;06","00;55;18;11","If so, we've got this these flows happening and we, we have state spaces that get readings off. So the very first state space reading, I mean, unless you got a prior somehow to go on, you don't really know what that means. Another one and another one. And so you get a series of state space insight, so to speak, and then you start to get a sense of whether something's more or less than I mean, in the simplest term, the average."
"Unknown","00;55;18;11","00;55;40;21","Right? But you know, we can then use gradient descent in that to sort of get an understanding of that. And that with children that can be interesting is so yeah, sometimes you just going to go with everything. And then I notice also like I get that with my daughter Layla. Sometimes it's like, you know, she was she was saying like, I want something very specific or that school there."
"Unknown","00;55;40;21","00;56;00;27","So and so when's that school like that? She, she knows. Well, I know because that's what happened when I was little. Maybe when she was a small baby or and it's all kind of made up stories in some extent, but it's kind of like she's converging on she's got enough state space information to say, OK, and probably you've got that with food, right?"
"Unknown","00;56;00;27","00;56;27;07","It's like there's there's enough state space information to say this and they can be proud. And I know that. And you didn't know that she hates me. I knew that you didn't know that. I knew that. This is quite cute that you've got that. OK, so she's got enough state space awareness that they're going to converge down. And then there's other times, like when you want them just to stay on the football pitch and not run off the swings, they just go crazy."
"Unknown","00;56;27;07","00;56;57;01","So there's something about, you know, sampling the space and saying you've got enough information and synchronization onto joint action MANIFOLDS is going to be one of the prices of the paper. So blue as a response. And then Dean so you know, super interesting about like asking your daughter Stephen, like, you know, the things she says that she remembers from when she was a baby."
"Unknown","00;56;57;06","00;57;18;22","It's something that's really fun to do with kids. And it's also leads to like the synchronization where I feel like maybe where we're going, but ask a kid when they can first talk, like when they can barely talk. Maybe like, you know, two years old is ask asking kid where they were before they were born. The answers are awesome or like, do you remember being in your mommy's tummy?"
"Unknown","00;57;18;22","00;57;39;04","Like and like, you know, I've heard ranges and ranges of of answers from kids and it's really super interesting. So where is this like is this some inherited prior? Is this like past life regression or is it just like they're falling into synchronization? They're making something up because children have these like great imaginations at that age. But where does this come from?"
"Unknown","00;57;39;04","00;58;08;10","Like, are they just responding back to what they think you want to hear? This is like an absurd question to ask you kids, right? Like, I mean, you can't really expect a reasonable answer, but ask because it's fun to find out what what they think that they were doing before they got here. It's fun and Dean first. Yeah, I think it's interesting because if you're going to go back to that geometry aspect of, you know, can can two year olds think in the abstract state?"
"Unknown","00;58;08;10","00;58;30;13","Yes, they can, number one. And the other part of it, I think where we're sort of we're all sort of synchronizing around is that if it's less or more that can be represented by the X and the Y on a graph, we've already shown that but if you want to think whether it's in or out, you have to add that Z vector."
"Unknown","00;58;30;25","00;58;56;20","And that is the part that most learning doesn't necessarily explicate. It's there two year olds do it. They know whether they're in or out, they know whether they're getting the whole apple or a slice so again, I ask, are we are we attempting as people who are trying to help the two year old to build a bridge from point A to point B?"
"Unknown","00;58;57;04","00;59;21;04","Or should we be actually understanding this as building something that is a product that is material to something that is possible? That's what the stochastic field is until we collapse it to that point. B, Right. And the only way that that happens is if we include in and out, if we include clear with the Z dimension to this."
"Unknown","00;59;21;11","00;59;47;02","So again, if we if we can't get in our own minds, if we can't get that correct, then we're actually going to get in the way of developing pedagogy it's I'm sorry to say that, but it's actually true. So we can think of these little people as these wonderful little right right brain the right brain hasn't been brought down to this."
"Unknown","00;59;47;03","01;00;15;19","It's these, these equations at the bottom of this page. And yet they're still able to function. They're functional form is self information based on product to process, to be determined so again, I'm not saying this because I've got it all figured up, but because I don't want to have this active inference tool, which is a fantastic pretend cheat potentiated to be collapsed to."
"Unknown","01;00;15;19","01;00;54;19","Now here's that here's the potential outcomes that we can engineer A through Z that that doesn't allow for a hunt Hudson Yards and yet there's a Hudson Yards. So if we're going to help people, let's not, as you say, Daniel, let's not over reduce prematurely here in the hopes of actually helping people when in fact what that does is it says as you fall out of the sky, rain drop you, you shall depart this this flow in Surrey British Columbia or the Gulf of California or at the at the mouth of the St Laurence River."
"Unknown","01;00;54;28","01;01;24;06","We can't do that or we shouldn't, but we do. And I can understand why the greatest thinkers do that. Well, I can't because we like to talk. But but bottom line is we've got to think rethink this. That's what active inference supports totally agreed. And we can engineer the landscape of flow. You can add a dam so that the water droplets do go one place or another."
"Unknown","01;01;24;06","01;01;50;04","But very interesting metaphor. So, Stephen, on this, and then we're going to go to the next tool that gets introduced yeah, I think well, I think I feel I know. So there's a question of it's an interesting question as well. When you say you to your old is where do they get the knowledge from? So we have abstraction in terms of thinking abstraction."
"Unknown","01;01;51;05","01;02;23;25","So we have well and the sort of ontological abstractions that we can create around our knowledge structures. But, you know, they have access to two years of state space, experiential sensations of which they can then make a story from whichever way they so please as they can. So there's an interesting question that that what it means to know that's abstract I or what's outside of the sort of lived experience level."
"Unknown","01;02;24;02","01;02;55;18","And it's sort of and there's the other way. And when when one thing I always find interesting is I see a child is around the age of 23 you see really see a change in the fingers the whole morphology the body shifts. And I think one of the reasons that maybe that memories aren't excessive or from before the age of three is literally they were encoded in a different body that's too far removed to revisit the the priors or the likelihoods from the states faces that had been laid down."
"Unknown","01;02;56;12","01;03;18;28","So it may be part of the natural way that we sort of forget but we don't necessarily forget the thoughts that we had cognitively. We just forget the the embodied stuff because we're going to we're going to lay down some new stuff unless you have a trauma, in which case that can lock in certain states. Lou, any comment on that?"
"Unknown","01;03;23;02","01;03;48;12","Of course. So, you know, it's interesting that encoding in a different body, I mean, we're doing that every seven years, right? Like we full cells and over but you know, there's there's this process of synaptic pruning that happens. So as we're babies, you know, we grow the zillions of neurons and then synaptic pruning happens like around the age of two or three where a lot of these neurons die back."
"Unknown","01;03;48;12","01;04;12;17","And then the ones that stay exist and continue to to build stronger and build better. But everyone is so completely different in terms of like their ability to remember things from when they were a baby and not always related to trauma. Like, I have no conscious memory instrument till I was ten but is super late. And like there's no I mean, maybe I might do some like hypnosis and reveal some kind of trauma like at some point in my life."
"Unknown","01;04;12;17","01;04;29;06","But I mean, for me to not have any like I remember like some flashes and some stuff. I remember the photograph you showed me the picture. Oh yeah. I remember that. I remember it. No, I probably remember the picture of it. Right. Like, so there's this whole other level of thing. But but the idea of being encoded in a different body is super interesting."
"Unknown","01;04;29;06","01;04;49;10","Because, of course, my body is different now also, but from when I was ten. But I mean also, like, you know, when you're 90, your body is different from when you were 50. So what stays? What goes? How is it chosen? Is it the same body, the aspect of it? Or it's just like, you know, we lock in to the things that we think are important for our model."
"Unknown","01;04;49;17","01;05;26;24","And if it doesn't, if it's not relevant for our model, maybe we just let it go Dean, I just want to say this real quick, because I know you want to move move forward, Daniel, but everything that we describe here in order to get to a concept of between, whether it's between us today and us seven years plus a day before that, between or any other between that we want to describe at some fundamental level, we have to be able to discriminate between more and less and what's in and what's out."
"Unknown","01;05;27;19","01;06;14;28","If we can do those things, we in any situation can describe between now, once we can describe between, we can see a difference between what a product is. The bottom of this slide and a process something that that equation can do. If we can get if we can get that clear, then stochastic chaos is a between thing that we can then manipulate to a certain outcome, or we can leave open to possibility if we can get that, just that we we will have conquered more than most people have conquered in their lifetime because they use the word between."
"Unknown","01;06;15;12","01;06;44;02","But I don't think they necessarily understand what makes that up. And I think that's what we I that's what I would like to be able to share with others and co learn with others as opposed to gives me building another set of specific outcomes that we can measure and say this was you one month ago, you a and this is you now seven years plus a day."
"Unknown","01;06;44;29","01;07;12;13","And now we're going to now we're going to decide whether or not you're closer to some thing that I've arbitrarily selected as the thing that makes you have learned something if we can get there. Could you imagine how amazing that would be? That just that one thing. Sorry, I get really passionate about this, but holy crap, I'm actually talking to people who can actually hear that and go, oh, that's interesting."
"Unknown","01;07;12;13","01;07;42;00","Instead of just dismissing it out of hand and going, We don't need to learn that because we already know what between meets between is geometric. So for sure information geometry will come into play. And then the idea of taking vast situations and through time with uncertainty and then calculating more or less Kafka expected free energy that could be an extremely helpful approach."
"Unknown","01;07;42;14","01;08;00;22","So blew anything on this or will continue. Yeah. So what's the next thing? Are we going right into the Michael Blanket no man talk about between now. Yeah, I just work. It's the markup we get what we talk about between I think that having that idea of the mark, I think I'll add it at that time. So, so go on, carry on."
"Unknown","01;08;00;23","01;08;29;24","Absolutely. The mark off blanket is even understood by the non technical as a between this but is it the between this that is your epithelium mechanically or what kind of between this are we actually talking about. We need the tools. Let's go to the next tool. So however this is the quote in general, we cannot discount the correction term that arises when flow operators are a function of states."
"Unknown","01;08;30;14","01;08;57;20","So if it were just Mt. Everest, we could just do the solenoid in the gradient decomposition and then figure out how to combine ISO contours with gradient climbing and we would get to the top. However, swept under the rug by the housekeeping term, is this change in the underlying mountain landscape? Indeed, it is this state dependency that underwrites stochastic chaos."
"Unknown","01;08;58;05","01;09;18;14","So a way to think about that is like the double pendulum the chaotic ness of that system arises from the exact angle that the double pendulums are in. You can't just say there's a Mount Everest and it's the bottom, it's like, OK, not very helpful for me predicting these wacky waving shapes. It's Do it. This presents us with a more difficult problem."
"Unknown","01;09;19;08","01;09;47;26","The problem can be finessed by using polynomial expansions of the flow operator and the potential as follows for end states. So could be one, two, three, four, and dimensions up to polynomial order. M so a linear approximation has a polynomial order of one a quadratic approximation has a has a polynomial order of two and so on. So it's like fitting higher and higher order terms."
"Unknown","01;09;48;13","01;10;20;24","So the big idea is that we're going to use polynomial expansions to approximate complex underlying flow functions, polynomial expansions do many things, but most importantly, they restrict or scaffold our model selection approach to a very specific form and function and size and tractable computation. So individuals might be familiar with a Taylor series, which is where you take a given point and you say, well, what is this function at that point?"
"Unknown","01;10;20;24","01;10;44;29","Like the sine of zero is zero. And then you say, What's the first derivative? That's this red line. And then you say, What's the second derivative? OK, it's starting to curve a little down, OK, what's the third derivative? And so on. And you can use the Taylor series to approximate that function further and further out from your entry point that you're calculating the first, second, third, fourth, fifth derivative on, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;10;45;20","01;11;09;17","And then this is a static approximation. So this is something that might be learned in high school or college level math, a topic that's very related but not always discussed is the Volterra series. And so the Volterra series is a model for nonlinear behavior similar to the Taylor series. It differs from the Taylor series in its ability to capture memory effects."
"Unknown","01;11;10;02","01;11;47;07","The Taylor series can be used for approximating the response of a nonlinear system to a given input. If the output of the system strictly depends on the input at the given time, and this is developed quite extensively, the Volterra in a SPM textbook by first in at all so again, many of the seeds and roots of what we're talking about today check the SPM textbook and documentation because that's where a huge amount of this competency in these authors arose from and how they represented it almost 15 years ago."
"Unknown","01;11;47;28","01;12;20;21","So what happens when we do this polynomial expansion of the functional four? Well, first off, we moved the problem that we were solving from static mountains only to trampolines that are moving as we're walking. That's what brings state dependent changes into the mix and action as well. And it moves us from again a static landscape that we can just calculate where the rulers are flat on and then just figure out the best way to get there."
"Unknown","01;12;21;03","01;12;57;04","Well, you can't just lay a flat ruler if they're state dependent changes because where the rulers flat at t zero is not where the ruler is flat. Literally the next moment the. Yeah, I think this is excellent, Daniel, because what this now says is now we can explain why there are impressions, why there is some residue left over, why the in and note aspect of this, not just the bump but the in and out going through that bump also has to be accommodated or explore at least acknowledged as part of everything that we're looking at here the whole thing."
"Unknown","01;12;57;19","01;13;25;11","So yes, that's a great explanation. Thank you. And the learning landscape isn't just the mountains. The interaction landscape is more like it's like the coupled systems we'll get to soon. But it's even one person. Learning landscape is like being in trampoline world sometimes so that brings us into this space with many important topics that are discussed in an earlier and different way."
"Unknown","01;13;25;11","01;14;17;21","By the SPM textbook. Now, how good is or could be this polynomial expansion? They write inspection of the Lorenz system suggests that a second order polynomial approximation is sufficient given the flow is second order in the states. So we're fitting in approximate motion that has two terms. So it's like a quadratic. So that's why we talked so much about the ball because the approximation that we're fitting is ball like which allows optimization techniques that are simple like convex optimization those are easy to roll the ball to the bottom of the hill by minimizing the potential function, which potential function, the free energy potential function, the free energy functional whereas if it was a rugged optimization"
"Unknown","01;14;17;21","01;14;42;07","landscape, you get the whole headache of how do you know when to stop? And what if there's just a whole neighborhood you didn't even go to so it seems like potentially a second order approximation is sufficient. Then they use this word on sorts, which is nice. It's an assumption about the form of an unknown function made in order to facilitate solution of an equation or other problem."
"Unknown","01;14;42;23","01;15;08;02","So now we're going to go with this idea that if we can have a second order approximation for Lawrence, we're going to be doing good enough. Let's work with that and see if that turns out to be the case. So it turns out if this thing that's so hard to model the self information, the surprise, the potential function is modeled by a second order polynomial, then the non equilibrium steady state is approximately Gaussian."
"Unknown","01;15;09;12","01;15;44;04","This is known as the low loss approximation in statistics, which is also in SPM very helpfully. Here we generalize the notion of the plus approximation to cover not just the quadratic form of the log density but also the solenoid or flow that underwrites non equilibrium dynamics. So the LA Plus approximation in classical statistics is like we're going to take the density distribution of what we're trying to estimate and we're going to find the peak, the maximum point, and then we're going to fit a Gaussian over that peak."
"Unknown","01;15;44;26","01;16;03;21","And so if there's like a big shoulder and then a tiny shoulder, you're just not going to get that tiny shoulder, right? But that's a very rich distribution. If it really has that structure in the real world, what you're going to get for that distribution is a Gaussian centered around the big peak. So for some distributions you're going to be way off."
"Unknown","01;16;03;21","01;16;32;24","There are things that are hard to estimate and there's things that don't work well with the Laplace approximation. It's not a solution, it's an approximation however, if we're interested in the mean and the variance around potentially the bulk of a distribution, then solving the parameters for the Laplace approximation is as easy as fitting a quadratic, which is to say the ball sliding to the bottom of the ball."
"Unknown","01;16;33;05","01;16;59;14","And once you go beyond second order approximation, you have a third order quadratic, there's a whole nother world because then the ball could get caught in that first little elbow or it could fall off the other side. So higher order approximations, they take more computational resources and while they might have increased accuracy, they can often be less tractable to actually solve."
"Unknown","01;16;59;26","01;17;34;16","So this is at least in my reading, a pretty fundamental contribution to the statistics of complex systems because they've taken the notion of Laplace approximation not just towards estimating the mean and the variance of some distribution out there, but to the saw an oil component, a flow post Helmholtz decomposition related to non equilibrium dynamics. Steven So up to this point we actually don't need Markov blankets yet."
"Unknown","01;17;34;26","01;18;03;22","It's a given. We haven't used the word. So how exactly has not come into play at all? Exactly, exactly. So it's telling. So you've told the story of what needs to be in place for that to be the kind of state spaces and then the nature of these state spaces being so changeable and nonlinear. And then there's this on top of that."
"Unknown","01;18;03;22","01;18;30;27","Then there's a way to attractively work within that which is the low pass approximation in statistics, which gives you does it always give one guy, is it Gaussian on any landscape or is there multiple or is it just one per landscape? Is yes, per dimension. Per state. The applause returns one and only one mean and variance. It's like fitting a Gaussian distribution to the log density."
"Unknown","01;18;31;22","01;18;59;09","So it does only give one, which is why I gave the example of the to hump. It's going to pick one and go there. And so, yeah, look, let's look at figure two. And so how interesting though that the paper is Markoff blankets and stochastic chaos but we're not even at the Mark Blanket. But the way that it gets led into is very improved and different than what we've seen before."
"Unknown","01;18;59;28","01;19;28;28","Instead of assume a partition dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, we're starting way back. So now here on the left is the flow of the Lawrence system using the Helmholtz decomposition. So here are the three components of the flow as they've described it. The blue is the gradients, the orange is the and oil flow, and then the gold is the correction housekeeping to write."
"Unknown","01;19;29;14","01;19;54;04","This uses the same format, but for a laplacian system based upon the Laurens and the upper panel. So we're going to be fitting a place like approximation to each of the states, each of the dimensions of this loran strange attractor the key difference is that the disappeared of part of the flow operator and the hessian are positive, definite."
"Unknown","01;19;54;21","01;20;22;15","So just really quick matrix vocabulary the jacobian matrix is the matrix of the first partial derivatives. So in the X, Y and Z dimensions, or however many there are what is the angle of the ruler? That's the first partial derivative. The Hessian is the second order, partial derivatives. So it's describing the local curvature so if someone said, my rulers flat and it's curving down, you're on the top of a hill."
"Unknown","01;20;22;29","01;20;47;06","If you're rulers flat and it's curving up, you're at the bottom of a hill and so on, so that's how the zero with the value of the function, the first derivative and the second curvature are used like in calculus so the hessian is positive, definite, which means the gradient flows converge to the maximum of the non equilibrium steady state density."
"Unknown","01;20;47;21","01;21;33;28","This is reflected by the blue arrows that point to the center of the state space. So in the Laurens world you're getting race card around. The flow is taking you all over the place yet by making the Laplacian approximation, all of a sudden the flow, the attractive part that's dominating the movements within that space, it's actually convergence. So that's not to say the Laurens system converges to a stable point, it's to say our approximation parameters converge towards potentially a more tractable and simple attractor in the abstract approximation space and we'll see how well of an approximation that indeed is."
"Unknown","01;21;34;08","01;22;05;17","But that's the key differences here. The blue arrows are taking you on a wild ride as the gradient takes you around the Lorenz flow. Here, we're doing a flow composition on our approximation, which we constructed to be of a certain type, and it turns out to have properties in its attractor that are very different than Lorenz Dean. And see then, yes, here's a question for everybody here."
"Unknown","01;22;05;17","01;22;44;22","If if we're talking about a process, could we be looking at those over time, seeing those areas in both the Lorenz and the the Laplace decomposition thickening or expanding or like having water added to them is has anybody contemplated whether in fact that is what is happening over time? So the fit is actually from a within the space is getting filled up by these arrows growing in terms of their circumference very interesting question."
"Unknown","01;22;45;18","01;23;35;09","The length of the arrow usually describes the amplitude like the speed of the flow in that moment. I do not know if I've seen a visualization where the tree rings. The arrows represent thicker or thinner vectors. But great question. And if anybody with more experience in vector math has a thought, that could be very interesting to know. OK, Steven, Adam Blue and just to clarify that I've got this right, but in each of those points where you've got the blue arrow and the surrounding flows so each one would be sold, so to speak, for that point, as a as I you know, a Gaussian approximation and then by this is like an assemblage of multiple"
"Unknown","01;23;36;21","01;24;18;19","results of a Gaussian approximation and so mapping them out, so to speak. And so this, this idea of multiple pieces of information and nested in this is so it comes into play with this. Yeah, there's some landscape and we go out there with our ruler, our jacobian and our curvature ruler our hessian, and then we're going to make just transects on the hill and we're going to just sample a bunch of points and add a bunch of points, you know, one comma, one, one comma, two, we're going to use the ruler and the curvature and we're going to look at at that point where the field is pointing and then if you've sampled at an"
"Unknown","01;24;18;21","01;24;50;18","inadequate resolution, you're not going to see a coherent vector field. So you need to sample at a resolution that allows the vector field to be kind of obvious so bloop. So I just want to point out, for people who might not know that you need to have a positive, definite machine to calculate a covariance matrix, like in the statistical analysis that I've done, this is like one critical point."
"Unknown","01;24;50;18","01;25;12;14","And if you don't have an invertible hessian, then you have to recalculate your model because all of your factors are too entangled to find out how they are covariate together or separately. So I just wanted you for anybody who doesn't have the background in in matrix maps. Let me point that out. Yes, thanks, Dean. So please help me."
"Unknown","01;25;12;22","01;25;44;19","Does that mean literally that you can't send one of those arrows you can't you can't let certain things be purged from your state space because that's like I really don't know. I'm not questioning I'm asking a question from a statistical standpoint and then being able to translate that to the physical reality. So I don't translate to physical reality."
"Unknown","01;25;44;19","01;26;08;10","Well, my brain just like doesn't work that way. But but what has to happen is what that really means is you can't establish conditional independence without having some idea of the covariance. And so if you can't calculate the covariance, you can't discover this conditional independence, which is why where we're building up to then in specifying the Markov link it."
"Unknown","01;26;08;13","01;26;39;00","So I just want that's, that's why I wanted to just point that out because you have to have that ability to find that that covariance. OK, let's go to where the covariance comes into play. And then Stephen so we're going to address how well does this approximation work because I mean, we're fitting a few quadratics to like the OG complex system is that really going to work what's being shown in figure three is on the very top."
"Unknown","01;26;39;11","01;27;05;07","So this is the left one is second versus third. First versus third and first versus second. So these are like three projections on a cube. So we're looking on a flat screen or a piece of paper about a three dimensional state space. And the red dots are the sampled trajectory in that cube so it's like there's a firefly moving around of the cube and we're looking at it this way."
"Unknown","01;27;05;07","01;27;48;04","And so we're projecting it onto that screen. And then in the background we see this very nice unit modal Gaussian attractor. So the lighter part is like the attractor part and then the darker part is higher potential function, more surprising, less likely. So that is the Lorenz trajectory being played out in our Laplace like Approximation Cube. And so it can be shown that the flow of the Laplace approximation, it, it has some of that kind of butterfly race car dynamics."
"Unknown","01;27;48;20","01;28;20;22","It's probably doing a lot better than just sticking a linear equation through it, but it's not perfectly recapitulating the underlying Lorenz system. So how good is the approximation? Well, one thing that this approximation is going to live or die by is whether it can characterize the Lorenz system as chaotic or not. Because if it turns out that the way we're going to deal with chaos systems with a positively off and off exponent is fit a non chaotic model, oh, I made an oscillator pendulum to describe homeostasis."
"Unknown","01;28;21;13","01;29;11;29","OK, so you made a simple model. Great. But what's really interesting is if our approximation could also reflect chaos yet handle it attractively. So what they do in formalism 12 is they show that the estimated lyapunov dimension for the approximation is 2.48 and they use some numerical approximation techniques here, like by sampling a grid kind of that transect sampling idea, but for the operative exponent at those points rather than say just the gradient and that favors or that compares very favorably 2.482.43 importantly they're both like similar and way over one with the actual analytical lyapunov dimension."
"Unknown","01;29;12;26","01;29;52;15","So the approximation is actually highlighting the chaotic nature and almost quantitatively the extent of the chaos because there's more and less chaotic systems. And so for our purposes, the lip gloss approximation is easier to handle than the Lorenz system because the functional forms of the flow in potential are immediately a hint. That's the whole point. We used an approximation family of equations that's going to be like having a ball rolling down to the bottom of a ball rather than being swept up in turbulent flow figure four is where we get to the covariance that Blue mentioned."
"Unknown","01;29;53;06","01;30;26;19","OK, so we're going to have three states. Those are the X, Y and Z. States are dimensions of the Lorenz system, and now we can look at the log of the log is just sort of a transformation to help highlight some of the differences between zero and one. Especially we can see the log of the Jacobian, which is that first partial derivative the log of the Hessian, which is the second partial derivative, and then the log of the covariance in the middle, which is like what Blue was referencing."
"Unknown","01;30;26;19","01;30;55;11","So here the first and the second states dimensions have very high correlations. Neither of them are correlated with the third. So the on diagonals are states being correlated with themself. The first and the second dimensions have high correlation. Well, what does that look like when we use that cube shining light? So on the bottom left here, we can see like the first and the second have a like an oblong relationship."
"Unknown","01;30;55;26","01;31;28;28","That scatterplot has a significant regression through it. There's a correlation coefficient, there's mutual information there, there's non scarcity, whereas the other ones that are uncorrelated relationships have what looks to be more of a spherical correlation. Like if you sample variable A and B and it's just a circle, there's no mutual information. And so interestingly, the covariance matrix looks a lot like the hessian matrix."
"Unknown","01;31;29;26","01;32;00;28","So that is providing evidence that if what we care about is the covariance among the states, we're getting a very similar structure when we use the second order polynomial approximation to those states and it turns out that it does pretty well if you want to, for example, estimate the first state given the second. So what if we could only measure two dimensions?"
"Unknown","01;32;00;28","01;32;42;22","Well, we wouldn't want to pick one and two because they're basically correlated in their measurements we would want to pick two and three and then do a really good job at predicting one given two, which is to say that the informational dimension of this system is between two and three. It's two and a half basically. So those are some of the connections between covariance among different dimensions and polynomial expansions to dynamical systems based upon flow approximation and then just to summarize here, then we can have any questions."
"Unknown","01;32;42;22","01;33;12;15","And then in the last 20 minutes we'll look towards a markup blanket. We still haven't even gotten to the Markoff blanket yet. So just this is the, the foothills of Mount Markov and the right. It's important not to complete conflate, it's important not to conflate the simplicity of a non equilibrium, steady state density. That's this one with the complexity of the underlying density dynamics."
"Unknown","01;33;13;01","01;33;52;17","The map is not the territory. You just cannot say it enough. Simple approximations are not claims about system simplicity. In other words, when prepared or observed in initial state, the probability density can evolve in a complex and itinerant fashion on various sub manifolds of the pullback contractor, and they're going to use information length to talk about that. But the important thing to know is just that our approximation has attributes that resonate with the original underlying systems dynamics, as well as attributes that we specifically know are different or they might be different or not, but no matter what, they're not claims about the underlying system."
"Unknown","01;33;52;24","01;34;27;29","So that's not a pipe. Stephen Yeah, I think this also speaks to this idea of triangulation or Multimodality is like, say this, this isn't directly speaking to what's out there or what system or what you could say, what whatever the things are that are being inferred so there needs to be all the more approximations that can be triangulated, as I say, which is kind of what happens in qualitative research."
"Unknown","01;34;27;29","01;34;57;02","Qualitative research is all about the triangulation of research, not about the exact measures and accuracy within research. Then you can get a better grip potentially on what might be out there, if that makes sense. So like you say with that pipe, you kind of, you know, if I could if I could go in and, you know, I've only got I've only got one aspect of that reality so I can only resolve it to a certain degree."
"Unknown","01;34;58;07","01;35;26;27","And it is what it is. And then I, I'd have to see I, I don't know how big that is as a painting, how, you know, until I see it in a gallery, et cetera, et cetera. Right. So yeah, I think that, that this, this, the need to find the way to get an approximate way in means that you need to have many approximate ways in to start to make at a higher level confidence in what you're thinking Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","01;35;26;27","01;35;31;17","Dean. Yeah. Dan, I can go back to slide 48 for a second. Yes."
"Unknown","01;35;34;06","01;36;02;17","So this is the fascinating thing about contrast and proportion because you've got nine squares up in the upper right there with the jacobian in the and the covariance and the hessian trying to translate that and that. And I understand this is, this is the big this is the sort of the, the grail of translation to translate that and the contrast in the proportion that you see there to fresh eyes, to new eyes."
"Unknown","01;36;02;24","01;36;44;04","They might look at that middle one with a with a completely different sense of what that pattern is describing for us. Then that then the two outside slices of bread to us because we're a little bit more familiar with it, the contrast in the proportion, you can actually see where the hessian matters from a statistical standpoint. But drop that into a context now where you've got mountains and rivers and lakes and forests and streams and how do we take that information there, which is, which is really quite clear to people who are familiar with it and translate it to the context, the situation in which we find ourselves and are now trying, trying processing to"
"Unknown","01;36;44;04","01;37;25;29","a converged sense of context. What does this what does this envelope tell us right we're inside of this cube now. How do we get outside of it? Use this tool to so to reenter the context and have a an agreed upon sense of what cool variation means. This is this is the grail. If we can set up our learning experience as situated one where we take this tool in, but don't confuse use the tool as you say, don't confuse the math with with the field."
"Unknown","01;37;26;23","01;37;56;15","That's that's again, it's it's fantastic. Like if you can get a whole bunch of people seeing what are what's the big picture here, what is the tool, what's the contrast in proportion with a tool and then what is the context? What's all of this fractal stuff out there in different colors and different shapes and different sizes? How do those how do we put those two things together into some sort of coherent narrative point?"
"Unknown","01;37;57;15","01;38;24;03","So in the last ten to 13 minutes, we're going to finally verge to the N-word mark off blanket. And then next week it would be awesome to speak with any of the authors or anyone else who would like to share their perspective or will continue because like we're basically halfway through and we haven't gotten to the core piece of the mark all blanket."
"Unknown","01;38;24;15","01;38;48;06","So we're going to just look where we're going in the last little bit of dot one at an end to we're going to like, you know, land on that Markov trampoline and then see where we go. OK, in section four, they're going to repeat the analysis of the previous section approximating two Lorenz systems coupled to each other through their respective first states."
"Unknown","01;38;49;01","01;39;19;16","This induces a richer, conditional, independent structure from which one can identify internal and external states that are independent when conditioned upon blanket states. So this is the more classical Markov blanket definition, which is blanket states, are those that conditioned upon them make internal and external states conditionally independent. So that's a definition that we've seen before. And the internal, external and blanket states, they all are co instantiated."
"Unknown","01;39;19;22","01;39;45;19","It doesn't make sense to talk about one without the other, and we've mentioned that before. So in FIG. seven, it's a lot like FIG. three where we were looking at those three projections of the cube of one Lawrence system. Well, now we're looking at two, and it's pretty clear from looking at their trajectories as well as just from their movement in the state space like these are pretty synchronized."
"Unknown","01;39;46;00","01;40;14;23","So some coupling has been instantiated no different than if you had like two engines and then you connect them with a heat transfer device. They're going to have coupled temperature fluctuations except now it's like more statistical figure. Eight is a lot like figure four. So in figure four, we had this three by three matrix describing the first partial derivatives, second partial derivatives or the covariance of states one, two and three."
"Unknown","01;40;15;04","01;40;40;01","And the on diagonals were states with themself and the off diagonals were states with other states. Now we're going to have three plus three states, two sets of three, two coupled the that's one, two and three is the first ends. And then four or five, six are the three states of the second. Lorenz You see that in the Jacobian there's high correlation and within each Lawrence system."
"Unknown","01;40;40;14","01;41;10;19","And then there's that one in four where there's a strong value. That's the coupling like that is the cell that represents the coupling between the first upper quadrant and then the lower right quadrant. And that induces some extremely interesting covariance structures. That is what we want to investigate. It turns out that by looking at the hessian of this system, some partitions fall out."
"Unknown","01;41;11;28","01;41;43;27","Those partitions can be numerically analyzed to show that basically there's partial correlations that approximate the hessian of the Lorenz systems that are coupled so we can use the Hessian, which we already established. The second order polynomial expansion is like basically adequate. We can use the hessian of our approximation, not of the system, not the system has a hessian."
"Unknown","01;41;44;06","01;42;17;12","Our model of the Hessian approximation very well aligns with the partial correlation. And so that's demonstrated by showing that two states that shouldn't have correlation. Third and sixth and fourth and fifth. So like here three and six are not correlated. We can show that even if they start very correlated like they just happened to start at a similar value, the dynamics of the system actually move them towards having a zero or even a slightly negative partial correlation."
"Unknown","01;42;17;26","01;42;59;17","So our hashing approximation is giving us deep insight into the partial correlations. And then I think a great place to sort of posit is with this connection of the graphical Bayesian network that we've looked at before with that same partitioning into four states internal, external and blanket states now first and then others then partitioned the Markov Perl blanket states which are of one kind into these two kinds of blanket states, incoming sensory states and outgoing action states."
"Unknown","01;43;00;02","01;43;21;19","That's what links us with perception, cognition, action and control theory and planning as inference. So this is an image we've seen before. And here are those six states. So one, two and three. That's Lawrence System 11, then four or five. Six is Lawrence System two, and one in four is the only cross coupling that we're putting into the model."
"Unknown","01;43;21;29","01;44;05;20","That's this cell right here. So we're cross coupling one in four. You know, you have two neurons, they have two neurons. And then there's a little tin can between the two of you, and that's inducing a global structure to all six nodes. So you don't need to have every neuron wired to every neuron. There's sparse city in this connection structure and technical details aside that is going to relate to the partitioning, which we're going to be deriving a partitioning on the hessian which is a second order polynomial expansion of our model."
"Unknown","01;44;06;13","01;44;35;23","So I think that is a great place to go for today. And just then just to close, then we can have last thoughts or what we want to talk about next week. Just to reiterate, there's no claim either the original Lorenz system or coupled Lorenz system possesses a markup blanket so the territory doesn't have a markup blanket. Our coupling doesn't even have a markup blanket."
"Unknown","01;44;36;21","01;45;04;17","The claim here is that there exists a Laplace approximation to these kinds of systems that in a virtue of the zero elements of the Hessian feature markup blankets. So not has a markup like it is, wants to be did have. Those are speculative interpretations that maybe future larva will discover to be the case or not. But what this paper actually claims is very far from that blue."
"Unknown","01;45;04;17","01;45;33;22","And then Stephen OK, so here we're going to stop just as we're getting good, just as it's getting really good. OK, it's the cliffhanger for next week. Yeah. I just wanted to leave off with where this figure is in the paper. Like right under that figure, it says the names active and sensory or blanket states inherit from the literature where these states are often associated with biotic systems that act on and sense the external milieu."
"Unknown","01;45;34;10","01;45;56;02","So I'm like why are they imputing sensory states onto particles? Like this is where the great leap in the paper kind of happens for me. And I'm like, OK, now my particle is sensing, which is like to me, OK, like I'm actually OK with that. Like, you guys know, you've seen me like I'm pretty good with pants like ism at all."
"Unknown","01;45;56;08","01;46;19;00","Or at overall, and it doesn't really make a big deal big difference for me. I'm still very interested, but it's something that a lot of people I think they're going to get maybe tripped up by. So I would like to hash that up and to say, well, there's absolutely no claim that real systems have a markup blanket, you know, like the skin."
"Unknown","01;46;19;19","01;46;45;18","It's like, are we going to be talking about real systems and how it maps onto physical components of the real world? And the mechanisms of sensory transduction? Or is this about the hashing approximation to the lip loss? So sometimes very close to each other in the text. So that can make it a little bit ambiguous. Stephen Yeah, very, very cool."
"Unknown","01;46;45;18","01;47;22;29","Yeah. Blue, Blue makes a good point, I suppose what I'm sensing here. Yeah. And correct me if I'm wrong is that this is showing a way to show that patterns can be existing within the covariance of the tractor states or tractors just in them. So it could just be a blob of stuff, right? In among blobs of things and stuff and particles and then it also shows that there can be the ability for those dynamics to partition out."
"Unknown","01;47;23;22","01;47;52;21","So it's kind of gives a bit of two ways. It gives the partition outpaced and then it also gives a way to have a blob. This is a very technical term, a blob of very useful the classic chaotic states which don't need to be themselves blanketed, but could be what becomes just sort of sensory states, for instance, but could be a reservoir within a bigger reservoir."
"Unknown","01;47;53;03","01;48;25;11","Would that be correct? It sort of assumption if we truly had no difference between our approximation and our incoming observations like we had a perfect model, then maybe that would be a valid claim that the map was the territory. And for systems that we define in software, it actually can be that way. But for any real system, this approximation, there's always going to be a delta between the incoming observations and our approximation."
"Unknown","01;48;25;25","01;48;54;27","And so the claim here is that it's the hash in the second level polynomial expansion of our approximation that has some very nice mathematical properties, not that the system has that or any specific properties. Dean. Yeah, I would just speak to the idea that the skin is a, is a great example because you can look at it as only as a product, as a limit where you can look at skin as a process."
"Unknown","01;48;54;27","01;49;21;28","I mean, we know that all the processing that's going on there. So again, do we, do we do we collapse it down to one type of function as a product? As a limit? Or do we see it actually as a process as well as as a something that's dynamical, something that's constantly changing and then that opens up the idea of what between means."
"Unknown","01;49;21;28","01;49;46;12","Now, I don't know if it takes down to the particle level. Seems like it does. It does look at those Planck scales, but I'm not really worried about that so much as I'm I'm interested in the idea of what between noises because I don't know that skin automatically is a partition. Sometimes it's a process as well. So if we keep that open, that'd be something interesting."
"Unknown","01;49;46;22","01;49;47;26","To take up next week."
"Unknown","01;49;50;01","01;50;21;19","Great. Yeah. I think if anyone else has any comments like what a fun paper and one we hit a lot of the warm up stretching and preliminary topics and contextualization that brought us like right to the Vista of Mount Markov with further clouds behind even that. But we're where we know that we can step into the dot to with a backpack that's prepared."
"Unknown","01;50;22;03","01;50;58;17","And then these are really interesting and clearly either unresolved and or un communicated and or UN applied questions in the literature in the state of the art, which is what is the relationship between these formalisms and specific nouns and verbs in the world, the kinds of things that we're semantically engaging with. And if it turns out that the semantics of a markup blanket are not like the semantics of any other thing, or they're importantly different from a semantics of what we currently feel familiar with."
"Unknown","01;50;59;11","01;51;46;29","Great. Or it would be interesting if they do map or overlap or encompass or nest within some other semantics that already exist. But that's the question. So we can just look at our final closing questions and if anyone has a thought otherwise. 32.2 next week on November 16th. And we hope to hear from you if you would like to join the discussion live, just get in touch with us or contact us at active inference at gmail.com, or just show up and ask questions or make comments in the lecture but interesting stuff."
"Unknown","01;51;47;20","01;52;19;04","We were a little trepidatious with such a complex paper, but I think bringing simplicity and simple rules underline complex behavior. And how can our approximations be tractable even when the world is just infinitely surprising? Those are some of the fundamental questions that this paper and active inference address. So Blue Stephen and Dean great work and we will see everybody next week by."
