"Speaker 1","00;00;32;28","00;01;05;15","Hello and welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is Active Lab Livestream number 32.1321. Stochastic Chaos in Marker Blankets. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is learning, communicating and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at some of the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;06;09","00;01;36;04","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams. At this short link, you can see some of the past, present and upcoming live streams we are here in the early November 20th 2132 discussions on stochastic chaos and markup like blankets and in the second half of November we'll be talking about the paper thinking like a state and we haven't yet set the papers for 34 and 35."
"Speaker 1","00;01;36;04","00;02;04;05","So if you have any ideas or if you're an author you want to come on to discuss for these states then get in touch with us today in active stream 32.1 the goal is to learn and discuss this extremely interesting paper stochastic chaos and Markov blankets by first in lines all tougher to Costa and power from 2021 and there's a lot to cover in this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;02;04;05","00;02;34;29","There's a lot of formalisms and figures and keywords and broader questions. So I'm sure we'll have a lot to think about and discuss. If you're watching live, then please feel free to write a question in the chat because otherwise Steven and I are just chilling here, so let's get into it with just intros and warm ups and if others join, we'll have them introduce themselves when they do join."
"Speaker 1","00;02;35;12","00;03;03;26","But for now, let's just say hello and maybe bring up just something that excited us about coming to this discussion or something that we wanted to resolve today. So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California, and something that I liked or remembered about the paper was that there was seemingly some changes or updates to the formalism of core terms."
"Speaker 1","00;03;04;18","00;03;31;14","And so how to understand that in the broader trajectory of the literature, which one of these changes are like updates? Where is it a software update? Where is it a breaking change and then what are the implications of those changes for some of the broader conclusions that people do or want to draw from active inference? And the FSP like the nature of thinness or biological systems or levels of nested organization."
"Speaker 1","00;03;32;16","00;03;33;18","So Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;03;35;14","00;04;13;16","Yes. Good morning from Toronto. I'm Stephen and I'm doing a practice base which is kind of moves into methods based HD. I work a lot with group processes and working with spatial creative spatial approaches to help do sense making. So I'm really interested in active inference within that as a as a kind of unifying way to help to close a lot of the loops and the fragmented questions that come up when trying to do sense making with different types of people in different types of spaces."
"Speaker 2","00;04;13;16","00;04;45;00","So yeah, as with Daniel, I'm really interested about this paper as after the initial view of it, because you see stochastic chaos. And I, you know, I'm consciously trying to not go too far down a sort of an abstract academic aspects of things but I realize that actually these underlying processes have got quite a lot of applications in this ability to understand why and how things are unifying."
"Speaker 2","00;04;46;15","00;05;35;19","And I think that's really exciting because there's a lot of sort of semi cohesion that looks at larger cognitive processes, the sentence practices and in activist processes. But what we tend to see when it gets down to the nitty gritty is, is it's how are things bubbling up through the kind of stochastic chaos of the world and life, or should I just say stochastic, separated, chaotic processes and so the idea of having stochastic chaos and what that means in this paper does that it's quite useful to start to look at what it means to have to be able to reconcile those approaches."
"Speaker 2","00;05;35;19","00;05;44;02","So it actually does start to help think about more applied approaches. So that's something I'm I'm interested and excited about this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;05;45;03","00;06;17;16","Thank you, Stephen. In the 32.0, this is kind of the lead in was this topic of flow. And that is in a way what might start to bridge this distinction that you raised. And we'll definitely return to between kind of abstractions and applications. Flow is a term that has applications across domains from the flow of water, flow of people, flow of information and money to psychological flow."
"Speaker 1","00;06;17;19","00;06;54;27","It's kind of a nomadic term. It's a transdisciplinary term and then that's an abstraction we're abstracting to the patterns of flow that help us connect the dots across these different systems. But also we want to apply it. We don't just want to say, well, water is flow and information is flow, and that's the end of the story. So how abstraction ins and applications kind of work like the left and the right foot together to build our knowledge and our application, almost like our epistemic and our pragmatic value."
"Speaker 1","00;06;55;09","00;07;00;15","I think that'll be a thread that's important to pull out. What do you think about that?"
"Speaker 2","00;07;01;29","00;07;44;08","Yeah, that's a really helpful connection, and I think this also speaks to that usefulness of this work beyond modeling directly is when when this idea of flows talked about in in these ways is kind of a bit vague. Right? It's kind of and it still has this idea of things flowing in a certain direction and in the flow and so I think when we start to also have the potential for stochastic processes and in a way the sense that everything's flow and how does what does low and high requirements mean?"
"Speaker 2","00;07;44;19","00;08;24;18","You know, what does low and high competencies preferences mean? They kind of these are quite bucket terms, right? And essentially they are what they are because they're workable truth be told. But, you know, we can start to look for something which can hold things in a more unified way, because I think that the way that we might feel in the flow when we're in a zone where we can both do things and we're immersed in it, may may well be maybe what we're in all the time anyway."
"Speaker 2","00;08;25;18","00;08;38;09","But it's just a different form of so that that also changes you know, the kind of ramifications out there great point."
"Speaker 1","00;08;38;09","00;09;08;13","And we can actually connect that to this sort of view from the outside and view from the inside, which we talk about a lot in active. So it's almost like there's the skier going down the hill and the view from the outside, the behavioral view is like given the angle of the hill, they're optimally flowing, that river is physically optimally flowing down that hill, as you'd expect from the friction and the potential energy and just the physics of the setup."
"Speaker 1","00;09;09;02","00;09;33;08","And then there's this internal experience of flow. So it's kind of like maybe we are in flow all the time, even when we are getting, for example, distracted or bored or frustrated. In what ways is that still flow because if we think about flow, it flows good. You know, it's a state where we're productive and happy and things like that, and then we're out of flow."
"Speaker 1","00;09;33;13","00;09;57;13","That's what you'd hear in the psychology literature. But let's just say that the river we're flowing and flooding, we don't say, Well, we're done using flow models because now it doesn't do what I thought it was going to do. Flow is the whole space. So how do we think about this whole psychological space as being particular regimes of flow and flows?"
"Speaker 1","00;09;57;13","00;10;38;01","The big topic that connects stress, fear, feeling overwhelmed, concern, excitation, et cetera, those are all flow states. Maybe it's not the flow state that we expect, maybe not the one that we prefer, but a river can have flow states that we don't expect or prefer either. And so it's like when we do abstract to the physical systems, we get a whole quantitative toolkit and we also get the ability to maybe look beyond phrasings that see flow as just something to be obtained and rather flow as the nature of perhaps interior experience and then we can talk about designing or perturbing regimes of flow."
"Speaker 1","00;10;38;07","00;10;38;26","Yeah, it."
"Speaker 2","00;10;40;25","00;11;07;13","Yeah, that's a good point because from the out there's the outside system, like say seeing someone skiing down a hill, you could say there's different ways of doing that. And then there's from the inside, you've got essentially a dynamic, non-linear dynamic or organism in this kind of transit. So thrive and survive and that is different. There's no getting away from that."
"Speaker 2","00;11;07;13","00;11;36;21","And the nature of that difference is that. So that's another question here. But the interesting thing is on that graph as well is often that graph only the flow is only shown on the top, right? And not on the bottom left, even though it could be seen to flow down. And so some of that, it's like a quadrant and it's just the top right, which is seen as the flow but what's also interesting is it kind of depends again on these multi scale dynamics."
"Speaker 2","00;11;36;27","00;12;24;23","OK, so within certain scales of and temporal scales, things start to fit are are organisms, preferred states, some of which is kind of built into our morphology. So, you know, if something becomes so easy, for instance, it's a lot easier if I'm trying to protect a building just to stand in front of the front door as a security guard and nothing happens all day but and I may end up in some sort of flow, but there's a point at which there's a desire for some stimulation, there's a desire for some change."
"Speaker 2","00;12;25;08","00;13;12;04","And there's also maybe changes that happen at the kind of this so ties in with having Saffron Adams Saffron's work about, you know, windows of experience both in real time and over time is when is it kind of in the same sort of time scales that we consciously function in and when is something beyond that, you know, so that could be where stress and boredom or stress and burnout can be both because the nature of the activity is is too rapid, it's too disjointed for the morphology or it may be that we perceive it that way because we have some, you know, depressive depression or anxiety that's also not enabling us to engage in those"
"Speaker 2","00;13;12;04","00;13;13;26","ways. What are your thoughts?"
"Speaker 1","00;13;14;14","00;13;41;14","Great. Let's take that points to one of the formalisms of the paper. So you just mentioned how there's like multiple time scales and there might be slower time skills as well as faster ones, which might even be faster than our rate of perception or modeling which are one in the same. If perception is indeed a generative model, and this is very early in the paper in Section two from Dynamics to Densities."
"Speaker 1","00;13;41;28","00;14;11;29","So they write The aim of this section is to get from the specification of a random dynamical system in terms of its equations of motion so the for example, differential equations that define the time evolution of a dynamical system to the probability density over its states in the long term future from any initial conditions. So going from dynamical systems, which takes us into the temporal realm to the density realm."
"Speaker 1","00;14;12;13","00;14;45;26","And so there we think about ocean water of different physical densities. There's a motion to the densities because denser things go down. And so that idea of denser things going down or flow from high to low density regions, just like in the atmosphere, just like in the ocean, that is going to be connected to the behavior of random dynamical systems and to information geometry."
"Speaker 1","00;14;46;12","00;15;13;21","So that's a little bit of the next piece. But the two time scales are here. Here's a classic flow model. There's a flow, and then there's the fast fluctuations so it's like there's the river moving ahead at one kilometer per hour. But each molecule in that river is not always going at exactly that speed rates. There's a fast fluctuation which might average out to zero."
"Speaker 1","00;15;13;28","00;15;41;23","So in the bulk aggregate or in the time aggregate, the flow dominates the behavior of the river. But the fast fluctuations are also occurring and they can often be equivalent to a well behaved, i.e. Gaussian error term. So this is where we see the separation of timescales into sort of the flow of the river and then the vibration of the molecules."
"Speaker 1","00;15;42;29","00;16;11;02","And those have two different partitioning of the system. The flow is well behaved because it is just like a single number for the whole river in the simple example. And the fast fluctuations are well behaved because they're smaller. If they were larger than the flow, they would become the flow itself. So they're smaller than the flow and they might be uncorrelated or have a zero mean, which allows us to do Gaussian statistics on them."
"Speaker 1","00;16;11;15","00;16;21;08","And then this idea of separation to slow and fast time scales is connected to density dynamics through the Focker Planck equation. Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;16;21;08","00;17;01;19","Steven Yeah. Just a little question on that. So the is this time dynamic, so flow is both the time scale of interest, I suppose you could say, and potentially one which has a net kind of change in some sort of direction or kind of gradient descent, I suppose and then the fast fluctuations that's it doesn't say random, but it's probably more stochastic but could also have flows going on."
"Speaker 2","00;17;02;00","00;17;15;12","So is this, is this, is this, you know, how much difference in the rate do they need to be to be classed as good and fast?"
"Speaker 1","00;17;15;16","00;17;43;09","Good question. So the X with a dot is kind of like the derivative of X. It's the rate of change in X, it's the flow in X is going to be decomposed to these two terms. Now, we might be interested in a very special solution to this equation. So again, we have X dot is kind of the change in X which is being broken down to these two dynamical variables."
"Speaker 1","00;17;43;17","00;18;07;20","And then that's being equivalent to the Focker plank, which is more of a density framing. So that's the key introductory step in the paper is just to build this really strong equivalence arc. They're the same picture between the dynamical specification and the density specification. So if we could solve when the dynamics were at a steady point, that would be equivalent to when the density would be at a steady point."
"Speaker 1","00;18;09;04","00;18;43;08","There might be some methods to help solve it in one phrasing or the other phrasing. It turns out that there's a way to solve with a little bit more feasibility when P of X equals zero. So that's when the flow the density flow given this is zero. And so that's what they're discussing here. Is basically asking when does that equal zero?"
"Speaker 1","00;18;43;21","00;19;19;10","And that is a stationary point so it's kind of like doesn't mean it's just simply flat in the reservoir. But, you know, there's a pump bringing water up to the reservoir at ten gallons per minute. And then the reservoir is dumping at ten gallons per minute. Then that is going to be a point where there's a station parity in the overall densities of those two bodies of water, just like if it were two bodies of heat and so were solving for a special place, which is where the total flow rate is zero."
"Speaker 2","00;19;22;09","00;19;56;03","Can I just ask a question? Am I going to deeper? So in a way, the the the flow is the ability of having this relationship to the flow is it gives it gives you a sense, I suppose you could say it's like when the graph the the gradient zero, you know, at the top of a graph between two types of the sentence and is it's got like that, that flat gradient, it gives you a chance to choose moments which could have a particular set of properties would happen to calculate everything about it."
"Speaker 2","00;19;56;03","00;20;12;08","It's just that I said they said, they said and now when that happens what happens then is it then that you then measure the density and just keep measuring lots of density points when you find the flow points to be it, that's a state of equilibrium or this is something else."
"Speaker 1","00;20;12;16","00;20;38;14","It's a very good question. Taking samples and using that to say something about the landscape is something we are going to get to welcome Dean. So we will talk about how samples can be empirically taken to see things and do inference on the flow density but you you made a good point, which is that like we want to figure out something about a special point."
"Speaker 1","00;20;38;14","00;20;57;13","Like let's just say that we knew that we were solving for a quadratic equation, which is going to come into play later. So it is going to look like a bowl. Now, it'd be awesome to know every single point on the whole bowl, but it turns out we might only be interested or mostly interested in one point the bottom of the bowl."
"Speaker 1","00;20;58;03","00;21;26;23","And for a quadratic function, the bottom of the bowl is the only time that the derivative is zero. So we can have this big nasty quadratic equation and then take the derivative of it. The first derivative and then just ask when does the first derivative the slope of the curve equal zero? And we know that for a quadratic equation there's only one point where that happens, and either it's like a bowl or it's like an upside down bowl."
"Speaker 1","00;21;27;01","00;21;59;01","But because we constrained the discussion to a specific family of equations, which is going to be important for variational inference, we can then solve some very reduced equations like the derivative, which is of a lower order of computational complexity, and then just get the one point that we actually wanted, which is like the location of the bottom of the bowl and then from the bottom of the bowl and some of the coefficient estimates that we have, we actually do get the whole bowl."
"Speaker 1","00;21;59;19","00;22;32;23","So this is kind of like we're taking some big family of equations and then we're going to be looking for special points, like especially where the flow is at equilibrium or stationary, and then fitting a family of equations with a form that we know we can compute with to approximate a flow that has a different underlying dynamic. And that is going to come into play where they show very early."
"Speaker 1","00;22;33;00","00;23;06;20","You can take a Lauren's attractor, which has some equations that govern its motion. So again, those can be moved from the equations of motion to the density dynamics. And then you can reconstruct an approximation of its dynamics and your approximation to the dynamics doesn't have to be even of the same form as the generative process itself. So it's like you could fit a linear model between height and weight with some error, but that doesn't mean that there is a linear model relating height and weight."
"Speaker 1","00;23;06;28","00;23;16;01","It just means it's an approximation here, a stick with a form that's very easy to solve. Steven. And then welcome Dean. Feel free to add anything you like you say."
"Speaker 2","00;23;16;02","00;23;41;14","So in some ways this is a bit like that particle wave challenge whereby you know, you have to use a particle to find where something is in time in space. You have to use a very simplified understanding of the wave to say, OK, at this point I have to I can't, I can't have all the other information. But to have my location information even if it's an information or location."
"Speaker 2","00;23;41;14","00;24;13;12","So it's like the flow. Finding a point in the flow gives you a way to identify the location, maybe in the information space. And then the Focker plank gives you a way to then embellish that with another type of, you know, put information back in in a way back into that into the cake mix for a bit more, you know, a bit more so and a few more chocolate chocolate buttons in there."
"Speaker 2","00;24;13;12","00;24;39;26","And so you can see what's going on. OK, that's quite useful to think about that. Would I be right in the sense of like what those two equations are doing, one's giving you OK, some chance to two to choose a moment in information space or physical space. So this you got something too. And then the other one is giving you a way to then put some information in which you can then start to do some variational processing on."
"Speaker 1","00;24;42;04","00;25;27;00","All, give a short thought, and then Dean and Blue, feel free to say hello and just any overall thoughts and take it wherever you want to go. Most dynamical systems have been framed classically using these equations of motion. So you get like a matrix that describes the differential equations that describe the unfolding of the Lorentz attractor. So it's framed as a series of dynamical equations so this early equivalence allows us to bring some of the tools of fluid mechanics and density dynamics and flow to bear on these dynamical systems."
"Speaker 1","00;25;28;14","00;26;23;01","So there are some ingredients or some kitchen tools that make approximations to flow very useful for equations of motion that might be intractable if you try to solve it on just that domain, like figuring out a chaotic systems underlying generative process, it's basically not possible, but potentially by approximating it with a very specific type of approximation, families of functions that we know have certain behaviors which we're going to talk more about using approximation families that are well behaved and using some of the things that have been developed from flow decomposition like the Helmholtz decomposition that doesn't exist for dynamical systems."
"Speaker 1","00;26;23;18","00;26;51;11","So by making that equivalence between dynamical systems and flowing systems, we can then use flow tools to study dynamical systems, as well as making it clear that we're describing the flow of our approximation. But it turns out that that does pretty well, at least in some of these examples that they're going to present in the paper. So Dean and then Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;26;52;21","00;27;03;23","I, I wasn't going to come on today, but the conversation was stimulating enough. I figured I had to jump in here and maybe add my $0.02 at some point."
"Speaker 1","00;27;05;22","00;27;07;00","Thanks. And blue."
"Speaker 4","00;27;08;05","00;27;39;12","Hi, I'm Blue. I'm a research assistant in New Mexico, and I was into this paper because it's, I don't know, kind of keeps my interest in information geometry. And Daniel, I saw like in the dot zero that you mentioned that course that's online. I'm like going to look into that for sure. And, you know, I'm curious about like a lot of the leaps that were maybe made in this paper between like particles from particles to cells and back to particles again."
"Speaker 4","00;27;39;12","00;27;45;28","And those kinds of transitions get a little fuzzy for me. So I'm curious to see kind of where this flows to."
"Speaker 1","00;27;47;03","00;28;12;23","Yep. I think that was the information geometry course of John Bayes. So that's like I, I haven't taken that, but I know that that's recommended and very cool. So we talked a little bit about flow about that's kind of one of the dreams that we could have a unified flow model for heat and people information, behavior, strategy, et cetera."
"Speaker 1","00;28;14;04","00;28;41;14","And one of the earliest moves that they do in the paper is just to really lock down this connection between dynamical systems systems through time and systems with density. So it's worth just repeating that because that's the second section of the paper and that's going to be a lot of the buildup another term that comes into play is the lyapunov exponent and chaotic systems."
"Speaker 1","00;28;42;00","00;29;08;26","So if anyone has a thought, of course, just raise your hand. But one way that chaotic is quantified and formalized, this doesn't mean it's the only sense of the word chaotic. Because sometimes people do use it non technically. But the technical definition of chaotic is referring to the extent of the sensitivity of the system to small changes, for example, in initial conditions or in perturbations."
"Speaker 1","00;29;09;17","00;29;37;20","And so there's what's known as the option of exponents, which is something that can be calculated from the model of a dynamical system. And there are some dynamical systems where adjacent points stay adjacent. So it's like two pieces of wood that are just put in a river that's moving straightforward. There's other systems where adjacent points converge or where adjacent points diverge, and it depends where you are in the system."
"Speaker 1","00;29;37;20","00;30;04;18","Like if you're at the bottom of the ball, then the either way you go it's like a stable equilibrium are going to get pushed back in. But if the ball were upside down, then either points to the side of the top of the ball would push you and diverge so that's the of exponents. And there's a lot of technical detail in exploring chaotic systems from this perspective."
"Speaker 1","00;30;06;08","00;30;19;21","So that's one matrix term that comes into play is using the lyapunov exponents especially the leading lyapunov exponents to characterize some of the attributes of a system."
"Speaker 2","00;30;20;00","00;30;47;28","Stephen needs to mention that idea of a system, you know, two things coming together and when they can meet, you know the system as well, they can converge or they diverge, but they could also when they bump into each other, there's also that the dynamics of the system. So there's both of the system's dynamics merging the dynamics of the change."
"Speaker 2","00;30;48;12","00;31;08;00","It will stop changing once they make it rain so that there's also that extra level of dynamical change which you get with these nonlinear dynamical systems which are actually working with a dynamic of the change. So you can sort of reset itself. It's not like with one, say in a physical system, they come together. That's kind of it."
"Speaker 2","00;31;08;11","00;31;13;20","When you did with variations on change, it becomes much more generative."
"Speaker 1","00;31;14;24","00;31;50;11","OK, OK. Yes. So sometimes these exquisite sensitivities to tiny, tiny differences in initial conditions, they get swamped by random fluctuations so that's what's interesting about their approach here is again, they're partitioning out the flow from the fast fluctuations and then they're describing how when when random fluctuations are added in, then the strange attractor is going to be retraced by replaced by a pullback attractor."
"Speaker 1","00;31;51;09","00;32;33;17","And then the flow is the expected motion. So that's the movement of the river of the flow term. If this flow shows exponential divergence of trajectories, i.e. positively operative exponents, we can impute stochastic chaos they then use this approach to investigate one of the classic chaotic systems, which has also been one of the earliest chaotic systems of Lorenz, who maybe there was some other last year where we did a little bit more on the Lawrence, but it was a meteorology question."
"Speaker 1","00;32;34;00","00;33;02;21","Lorenzo and colleagues were studying the weather and how it changes and about some of the sensitivity of the dynamical models to tiny changes. Like it seems like if it's you know, 21.1 C, it seems like that should be very similar in its behavior in the long run to it being just one degree higher and then as you got further away, it's like, well, then it'd be way more different in the future if it's more different today."
"Speaker 1","00;33;03;03","00;33;27;06","But then it could actually turn out that a tiny difference ends up sending your equations haywire, whereas a very different initial condition might actually like feedback and come back to a similar attractor through time. So that's the kind of systems that they were investigating in the 1950s. And there's been a lot of computer and technical work since then."
"Speaker 1","00;33;27;14","00;33;36;02","But this is still a total classic and a beautiful, strange attractor for them to be working on. As the first example in their paper, Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;33;38;05","00;34;24;08","So from what you're saying, the strange attractor is the kind of complexity science idea of these mathematical models where things get cool in, as you just described in initial conditions. Can can change the nature of what that becomes within a certain range and obviously outside that range, it doesn't, it doesn't form. So it's still kind of off equilibrium this pull back attractor is a is it's almost a set of states which can be moved towards through looking at the flows within other types of chaotic attractors."
"Speaker 2","00;34;24;20","00;34;48;27","So it's making a difference. So it's in some ways a strange attracts. So the pull back attractor would need or involve some sort of inference or some sort of some sort of drive to make it happen is not inherent to this, to the nature of the mathematics of that particular thing. Once you let it roll, would I be right in that?"
"Speaker 1","00;34;50;02","00;35;12;20","So the pull back attractor, it's kind of like, let's just imagine the attractor is like a post in the ground and there's a bungee cord so if we were looking at that quadratic ball, it'd be like there's an attractor at the bottom of the ball. And then if all you saw was the lateral movement of the particle. So we don't know anything about the height necessarily or the shape of the graph."
"Speaker 1","00;35;13;05","00;35;40;13","We just observe that when we push the ball to the left it gets pulled back as if it's being on a bungee cord, pulled, left, maybe it even overshoots and kind of dampens. So that's like a pull back attractor to a point attractor. What's being shown here is an attractor that is in higher dimensions. So if you had a two dimensional pull back attractor, it'd be like the line Y equals X, and if you get perturbed off the line, you come back down into the valley."
"Speaker 1","00;35;40;27","00;36;03;24","So that's like where you start to see vector fields and the flow of water into a river and now we're in a three dimensional attractor, at least three spatial dimensions. And so it's kind of like there's a race car going around this butterfly track and then it has the bungee cord. So you're getting pulled to this car that's moving."
"Speaker 1","00;36;04;02","00;36;24;25","And then if you sample your location at different times, you're being drawn to a pull back attractor, which is the compromise between the flow as defined by the equations of motions of Lorenz attractor and the fast stochastic fluctuations. Dean and then Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;36;26;16","00;36;56;16","Now, just quickly, I think this is why sometimes using a the metaphor of building a bridge is difficult because not all not all times is as convenient as the lowest energy state in a bowl. Sometimes what we have to look at is the fact that at one end, call it point a we're trying to figure out what point B is, and it isn't always the lowest energy state."
"Speaker 3","00;36;56;16","00;37;39;05","I think here's an example. So if you ever if you've been to Hudson Yards in New York, it's a fascinating translation of a space over time. And it and if you were to ask the people who actually constructed those high trestles at the at the point that they were built, if you did that, if you had asked them X number of years later whether or not that was going to be the lowest possible energy state or attractor state, I don't think they could have predicted that and so that's why I think it's difficult at times when we for the sake of convenience, for effort to expedite our sense of what's going to happen next."
"Speaker 3","00;37;39;05","00;38;22;26","We use a connector metaphor, but in fact, that's not exactly what stochastic possibility is about. So what we tend to do is collapse down too quickly, down to the particulars of what purpose a product can serve. And if we're going to build a bridge from a product to a process, which is what I think looking at stochastic separation is about, we should maybe drop the idea of a static connector and maybe look at the back and forth and the actual dynamics of those dynamic situations, which were now the tool of active inference affords."
"Speaker 1","00;38;24;29","00;38;46;17","Oh, interesting. It just made me think about like throwing a Frisbee and it catches on a roof that's its lowest local energy state. But if you just thought about gravity, maybe you'd say, well, it's going to fall to the ground. So one particular trajectory may not realize the ultimate lowest energy state yet. In a way, it's in its own energy state."
"Speaker 1","00;38;47;04","00;38;47;26","So Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;38;50;27","00;39;15;14","Yeah, so thinking about applications, I think what they mentioned is a good point is there's a natural tendency to want to have that kind of bridge between two stable things. The thing with two stable things is it is the stable, as we just mentioned. So therefore, if you're trying to get information about variations within them, particularly chaotic variations, you're not going to get much."
"Speaker 2","00;39;15;22","00;39;41;27","Right. So you kind of need this. There's a need to be off out of equilibrium to to give the conditions where things can move in potentially a strange attractor or potentially other types of, you know, solenoid or flows or something. There needs to be some way for flows to happen. And then within that which I think that might explain why that last graph."
"Speaker 2","00;39;41;27","00;40;14;08","So if I'm if I'm right in thinking that those photographs that you showed there kind of showing that you've got this strange fact that you can sort of look at it staying space using points of where something has become moment momentarily zero in the flow calculation gives you a zero. So you can then take a point and then the bottom right is basically saying you can recapitulate that as a global potential."
"Speaker 2","00;40;14;08","00;40;26;13","So you can sort of by taking the changes that happen in the second order, you can sort of recapitulate some kind of understanding of the structure of the information. Is that right?"
"Speaker 1","00;40;29;12","00;41;11;17","There's a lot there. It so I cannot reduce it to a binary, but yes, it is showing different aspects of how strange attractors which are found in these sort of exotic deterministic chaos systems are like a perfectly clean double pendulum. And then how when we take the approximation, we find a pull back attractor empirically in the approximation. So now we're describing a nicer, still stochastic, but much nicer and more approachable pull back attractor like it's being pulled back to some butterfly shape."
"Speaker 1","00;41;12;02","00;41;48;01","Now we don't get these like rings of Jupiter situation from our sampling because we're taking particular samples and we're fitting then a flow, what flow generated those samples. So we never see rings of Jupiter's strange attractor. We're dealing with approximations of random attractors and then we have at least two tools slash helpful techniques to apply that are going to help us come to terms with that approximation."
"Speaker 1","00;41;48;15","00;42;20;16","So one of them is we're dealing with flow so we can talk about the Helmholtz decomposition. So this was discussed a lot in Active 26 and as mentioned in the zero stochastic Chaos and Mark on Blankets was submitted like a few weeks after 26 was submitted based on mechanics. So the Helmholtz decomposition describes this partitioning into the ear rotational kind of the gradient putting the ruler on the hill."
"Speaker 1","00;42;20;16","00;42;44;19","What is the angle of the ruler? If you're on the top of the hill, it's flat. If you're on the hill it's going to be at an angle. So separating that ruler on the hill to the hiking map, the ISO contour, so let's make the ruler flat wherever it is, whatever the slope is, and then let's just take that ruler and kind of move it side to side as we go around this hill."
"Speaker 1","00;42;45;05","00;43;06;24","Now, if you're on the very top of the hill, then the ruler is flat and there's no ISO contour. But if you're anywhere else on that whole landscape, other than a local maxima, there's going to be some angle to the ruler and some way to get around the hill. So that's the Helmholtz decomposition. So that's one piece that we get to bring to the puzzle."
"Speaker 1","00;43;07;07","00;43;38;08","And then one piece that would be interesting to ask the authors or someone with more technical experience is we've seen the Helmholtz decomposition before into the solenoid or in the gradient components, but then there's this housekeeping term, you know, capital lambda and that's described in an appendix and it gets quite technical, but it has to do with the density landscape changing as a function of flow."
"Speaker 1","00;43;39;00","00;44;06;14","So it's not just like we're going to have one mountain topography and then we're going to have rain falling on that one mountain. There's going to be some changes as we flow around so that it's more like you know, you have a jet of hot water into a cold water. You can't just take the, the mountain of temperature and then just ask, well, what happens if we pour hot water on top of that mountain?"
"Speaker 1","00;44;07;00","00;44;33;29","Because the mountain is actually changing. The landscape is changing as a function of the flow. And some of that gets incorporated into this housekeeping term. So one tool that we have is from the flow toolkit is the Helmholtz decomposition into these different components that help us reconstruct a flow that is a much better approximation Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;44;35;15","00;44;50;04","Now, you mentioned there that we've seen solenoid and gradient before with Helmholtz decomposition. When you say we've seen it before, we saying we've seen it more recently with the solenoid at work, what was the solenoid opening? There was."
"Speaker 1","00;44;51;23","00;44;53;07","Like this was dropped."
"Speaker 2","00;44;53;08","00;44;54;02","Slipping gradient."
"Speaker 1","00;44;55;12","00;45;15;20","Oh yeah, like we've discussed it in paper number 26 and other papers like this is not a novel partitioning by the authors and it's very linked to other discussions that we've had about Helmholtz decomposition in the context of distributional approximation."
"Speaker 2","00;45;17;10","00;45;22;01","Yeah, but previously was it was more of a focus on gradient descent."
"Speaker 1","00;45;22;19","00;45;27;00","The focus within your regime of attention potentially. But it was."
"Speaker 2","00;45;27;01","00;45;58;08","It was there. OK, right. Going way back to early days. OK, OK. So so in, just out in the, in that paper that was looking at Southern water flow. It was, it was, it was giving more weight to that, wasn't it? Would you say it was giving more weight? Was it using that in a different explanatory way because there has been this shift around solenoid or flow to give another way beyond the consistency to explain how these dynamics can work."
"Speaker 1","00;45;59;14","00;46;28;12","They're kind of co instantiated because they're partitioning from each other of the same underlying model. So which one is emphasized more is totally a question of situation and flourish. But it also may be the case that over the previous three years, there's more of an emphasis on the importance of the ISO contours in complex problem solving as opposed to just run and gun gradient descent."
"Speaker 1","00;46;29;14","00;46;55;11","So I agree with that. So that's one tool we have. OK, so we do the Helmholtz decomposition because again, we're making this deep equivalence between dynamical systems and flow systems so one tool we have from the flow world is the Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields. Now, they write in Section 31, our objective is to identify the functional form."
"Speaker 1","00;46;56;14","00;47;33;01","So could be used in the sense like what function does it play? Or a functional is like a function of a function, a functional form of the self information or potential function that describes the non equilibrium steady state density. OK, so we go back to in three, the fancy I, the fancy J, they write the first disappear of part performs a Romanian gradient descent on a manifold on the negative logarithm of the steady state density, which can be interpreted as the self information of any given state or as some potential function."
"Speaker 1","00;47;33;15","00;48;03;25","So this is how surprised should I be to be in this state? So now let's go back to our bowl you shouldn't be surprised if you're at the bottom. You should be surprised if you're at the top. There's high potential. Now, if it were gravity that were pulling us down that would be potential energy, gravitational potential energy. You have higher gravitational potential energy that can get dissipated free energy can be dissipated if you have greater potential energy."
"Speaker 1","00;48;04;10","00;48;28;19","So we want something that is just like you could have the ball and the ball and know where's the ball expected to be and where is it going to roll down from? Where is there potential that's high and where's the potential low? And then here in FIG. one, they're going to plot self information on the bottom left. That's the wax self information."
"Speaker 1","00;48;29;08","00;48;51;21","And then there's that is fluctuating through time as the system is cranked. It's kind of like if the self information were state were staying at a constant value, it'd be like if you're in that race car going around the track, then you're always where you expect to be because again, the ball is like a point attractor and then the Lorentz approximation is going to be to a dynamical approximation."
"Speaker 1","00;48;52;08","00;49;28;20","So we want to find the function of the non equilibrium steady state that's going to be describing how surprised you should be the potential function for that system. So these are big questions like how is the self information measured or calculated? And then what does it mean for the self information to be high or low? And how does the self information for different states that we might care about like homeostasis, how does the self information in those cases differ?"
"Speaker 1","00;49;28;27","00;49;36;26","Like is the self information higher or lower when homeostatic li you're in a good attractor. So Dean again, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;49;38;20","00;50;05;14","So I don't know this, but I would guess that on some basic level the measure is on its most absolute terms greater or less than to begin with, because I think that that that relative difference is something that anybody doesn't even have to be aware of consciously calculating. They can just you're kind of you can kind of tell, but I'm not really sure."
"Speaker 3","00;50;05;24","00;50;29;13","But I would think that as as we as we go up in terms of the, the determination and the accuracy of the measure, we would we could find ourselves getting more precise. But on its most basic level, I would think it would from a functional standpoint, that's where we would have to begin I guess."
"Speaker 1","00;50;29;13","00;50;59;07","And having being less surprised about the state that one is in entails having a richer and a more accurate generative self model. So if you have a model that just totally off base, you're going to be recurrently surprised if you have a very nuanced self model, your location and your circadian rhythm, then different observation is will be less surprising."
"Speaker 3","00;51;00;12","00;51;33;17","Yeah, I was just reading back what you were saying because you did a really good explanation that the way in your explanation that the key thing was I should be more surprised or I should be less surprised at you. You yourself, in doing the explanation, come back to that basic difference. And so again, as we get more precise, I think we can we can have more sophisticated ways of being able to show how we arrived there but at the beginning, even a two year old can somehow tell the difference between more and less."
"Speaker 3","00;51;33;27","00;52;01;01","That's why they dig in their heels right so it seems like on that basic level, before we get into some of the more sophisticated stuff, we all can, it says addresses these questions for one simple case. I think on its simplest terms, that's where we can probably start we can look there first. If that's not available. I don't know that other math matters."
"Speaker 3","00;52;01;12","00;52;06;17","I know it does. But to the person who can't see that first I'm not sure where they go."
"Speaker 1","00;52;08;00","00;52;30;20","This past weekend, we were hanging out with some lava with some children, and we were really struck by how there would be some times where it seemed like you just would tell them something totally different, like switch topic in the middle of a sentence, and they just went along with it. And then other times where they needed something really specific, like they wanted that piece of food and they want it in this part of the plate and they want to touch it this way."
"Speaker 1","00;52;31;02","00;52;50;16","And so it's like they have a generative model and there's certain parts that they're surprised by or not. And so we're just like, we want that piece of food. And I'm not too surprised that the route it takes to my plate but if their generative model entails a specific way that that is going to get to their plate, they're going to be surprised by anything other than that."
"Speaker 1","00;52;50;16","00;53;12;21","And if they don't have a generative model of topics in the world, then switching topics and talking about this event at a mad event, it's just like it's as if any other set of topics were addressed so great point about our intuitive connection to surprising information, how that's related to our generative modeling. So Blue. And then Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;53;16;15","00;53;45;11","So just to go to your child model, like having, you know, had lots of kids around for a lot of time, you know, food is something particularly that they like fixate on, right? I mean, I've my younger stepdaughter is like one of the easiest kids ever. Like she's so chill and so laid back. But like I remember when she was about two years old, she would like freak out like one time I cut I cut an apple for her, like sliced it up, you know, just to make it look easy to eat."
"Speaker 4","00;53;45;20","00;54;05;05","And she got so mad because she wanted the whole apple, the whole thing. And she thought I was only going to giving her a part of it. But I think maybe food is I mean, my point is I'm rambling a bit, but maybe food is one of these things that that is like so baked in to our generative model because otherwise the children have an attention span of a gnat."
"Speaker 4","00;54;05;12","00;54;22;22","Like, you know, you're in the car and they start to argue and you just say, oh, look at that pretty yellow car right there. And then they're done they're over it. Like, so, so generally, like, you can surprise the child and completely shift them. But when it comes to food, it's like this weird. And many kids like that just, you know, astronaut the apple."
"Speaker 4","00;54;22;22","00;54;38;22","But then there's also like this food can't touch that food. And like they have a bigger stake than me and all this stuff. So so this food like this fundamental like baked in thing that's like central to survival. And therefore it's like very deeply ingrained in our generations model."
"Speaker 1","00;54;39;06","00;54;41;15","Maybe nice. Agree."
"Speaker 2","00;54;41;17","00;54;48;26","Stephen Yeah. So the idea of children, I'll keep that analogy in there."
"Speaker 2","00;54;51;03","00;55;11;20","If so, we've got this these flows happening and we, we have state spaces that get readings off. So the very first state space reading, I mean, and then you go prior somehow to go on, you don't really know what that means yet another one and another one. And so you get a series of state space insight, so to speak."
"Speaker 2","00;55;11;20","00;55;32;25","And then you start to get a sense of whether something's more or less than I mean in the simplest term, the average. Right? But you know, we can then use gradient descent in that to sort of get an understanding of that. And with children, that can be interesting. So yeah, sometimes it's just going to go with everything. And then I notice also like I get that with my daughter Layla."
"Speaker 2","00;55;32;25","00;56;00;24","Sometimes it's like, you know, she was she was saying like, I want something very specific or that school there. So and so when's that school? Like now she she knows. Well, I know because that's what happened when I was little. Maybe when she was a small baby or and it's all kind of made up toys in some extent, but it's kind of like she's converging on she's got enough state space information to say, OK, and probably you've got that with food, right?"
"Speaker 2","00;56;00;24","00;56;27;04","It's like there's there's enough state space information to say this and they can be proud. And I know that. And you didn't know that besides me. I knew that you didn't know that. I knew that. This is quite cute that you've got that. OK, so she's got enough state space awareness. That's going to converge down. And then there's other times, like when you want them to just stay on the football pitch and not run off the swings, they just go crazy."
"Speaker 2","00;56;27;04","00;56;33;11","So there's something about, you know, sampling the space and saying you've got enough information."
"Speaker 1","00;56;34;17","00;56;45;29","And synchronization onto joint action manifolds is going to be one of the prices of the paper. So blue as a response. And then Dean."
"Speaker 4","00;56;48;19","00;57;09;04","So, you know, super interesting about like asking your daughter Stephen, like, you know, or the things she says that she remembers from when she was a baby. It's something that's really fun to do with kids. And it's also leads to like the synchronization where I feel like maybe where we're going, but ask the kid when they can first talk like when they can barely talk."
"Speaker 4","00;57;09;07","00;57;32;26","Maybe like, you know, two years old is asking where they were before they were born. The answers are awesome. Or like, do you remember being in your mommy's tummy? Like and like, you know, I've heard ranges and ranges of of answers from kids and it's really super interesting. So where is this? Like, it's this term inherited prior? Is this like past life regression or is it just like they're falling into synchronization?"
"Speaker 4","00;57;32;26","00;57;53;19","They're making something up because children have these like great imaginations at that age. But where does this come from? Like, are they just responding back to what they think you want to hear? This is like an absurd question to ask you kids, right? Like, I mean, you can't really expect a reasonable answer, but asked because it's fun to find out what what they think that they were doing before they got here."
"Speaker 1","00;57;54;07","00;57;57;09","It's fun and Dean first."
"Speaker 3","00;57;58;12","00;58;24;13","Yeah, I think it's interesting because if you're going to go back to that geometry aspect of, you know, can can two year olds think in the abstract state, yes, they can, number one. And the other part of it, I think where we're sort of we're all sort of synchronizing around is that if it's less or more that can be represented by the X and the Y on a graph, we've already shown that."
"Speaker 3","00;58;24;27","00;59;05;22","But if you want to think whether it's in or out, you have to add that Z vector. And that is the part that most learning doesn't necessarily explicate. It's there two year olds do it. They know whether they're in or out, they know whether they're getting the whole apple or a slice so again, I ask, are we are we attempting as people who are trying to help the two year old to build a bridge from point A to point B, where should we be actually understanding this as building something that is a product that is material to something that is possible?"
"Speaker 3","00;59;05;22","00;59;26;18","That's what this stochastic field is until we collapse it to that point. B, Right. And the only way that that happens is if we include in and out, if we include the Z dimension to this. So again, if we if we can't get in our own minds, if we."
