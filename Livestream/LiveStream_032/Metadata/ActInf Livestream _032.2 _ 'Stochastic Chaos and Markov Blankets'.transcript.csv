"Speaker 1","00;00;36;16","00;01;05;15","Hello, everyone. Welcome to act in flood to act in flash mob live stream number 32.2. It's November 16th. 2021 Welcome to the acting lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us some of the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;06;09","00;01;32;13","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good and fun video etiquette for livestreams at this short link, you can see some of the upcoming streams. This is our second participatory group discussion on the stochastic Chaos and Markup Blankets Paper and then in the second two weeks of November, we're going to be discussing Thinking Like a State by our friend and co participant, Adele."
"Speaker 1","00;01;32;29","00;01;59;13","And we haven't yet set the papers for December. So if you know an author who you'd like to invite, or if you yourself would like to join for several weeks of discussion of one of your works, then just let us know today in active stream number 32.2, we're aiming to learn and discuss and ask what if and what is and hold all these different questions at once."
"Speaker 1","00;02;00;10","00;02;27;22","We're in the second participatory discussion around the paper Stochastic Chaos and Markov blankets by Kristen Hinds or Topher de Costa in PA. And last week we had an awesome discussion in the Dark One, and we got right up to the cliffhanger where the the M word actually was deployed. And I think today we're going to sprint up to that cliff and then jump off."
"Speaker 1","00;02;27;29","00;02;54;18","So it'll be a fun discussion for those who are watching live. Totally write questions and comments in the live chat and Steven and Dean and I and anyone else who joins will be just more than happy to hear what you have to share and to roll with it. As you write. Thanks. So let's begin just by giving a introduction or warm up so we can say hello."
"Speaker 1","00;02;54;18","00;03;24;14","And then also just maybe what was exciting about the paper overall or since we all participated in the DART one, what are you looking forward to in the DART two or maybe how have you changed how you thought about it over the previous week? So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll say what I'm excited for until a little bit later and I'll pass it to Dean Good morning."
"Speaker 2","00;03;24;25","00;04;00;18","My name's Dean. I'm in Calgary in the in the one week's time since we left off, I, I think this paper, more than many of the other people we've had conferences throughout, breathes life into something that is typically perceived as not very alive. It's just, it's just a sort of a point to add an explanation of. But I think this is one of those papers where when people pick it up and start having conversations with one another about the kind of work that's being done here, it makes it really, really interesting."
"Speaker 2","00;04;00;18","00;04;08;09","Doesn't give us necessarily the answers that the authors could project would be given. And I really like that."
"Speaker 1","00;04;09;23","00;04;10;14","Thank you, Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;04;10;15","00;04;13;23","Stephen, I'll pass it to Stephen yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;04;14;01","00;04;50;01","Good morning as well from Toronto. I'm really interested in this paper, I think, because it does give a unifying perspective. It does help with that unified perspective, even though at first when you see things like stochastic chaos, it can be like, oh, we're going down another rabbit hole, et cetera, et cetera. But actually, rather than always justifying or talking about applied activity through inference, through applications and quotient applications, there is some benefit to this kind of coming to the foundation."
"Speaker 3","00;04;50;15","00;05;24;16","So I'm excited by that. And also actually following the conversation we're having earlier and the fact that we have this complexity weekend is some of the ways that complexity can be talked about outside of a more woo woo kind of conversational sense, at least foundational levels, which again seems to get into unnecessary detail. Ultimately, I think it starts to allow some of these crossovers between applications of complexity and this to happen, which for me personally I don't think was necessary to articulate a year ago."
"Speaker 3","00;05;24;29","00;05;29;23","So I think some of this work does just help fill in some of those gaps."
"Speaker 1","00;05;31;18","00;06;06;14","Thanks. I agree. Like the system that's picked up and turned around and remodeled throughout the course of the paper in a very narrative driven way is the Lauren's attractor, which is like the classic complex systems model. So it just kind of plays into contemporary work on complexity and so many other areas. But and then also I really like what you said, like the authors I hope will be able to join for a future presentation."
"Speaker 1","00;06;06;14","00;06;41;05","So we're in contact. They probably won't join today, but what the authors are putting out there and then how that's received and communicated around and explored, that's what's fun. And I know that will have many cool things to explore today. So let's jump to the big questions. Then we'll look at the roadmap and try to remember where we got to yesterday and maybe a different big question is striking either of you or anyone in the live chat today."
"Speaker 1","00;06;41;18","00;07;09;29","And then we'll try to remember how far on our road trip we got last Tuesday, and then let's see which sections we're going to get to. And we have a bunch of other things kind of written down so the big questions that we had previously asked were What is a good model of thinkingness in a chaotic dynamic and discipline of world how might this model or approach to this speak to system sentiments?"
"Speaker 1","00;07;10;15","00;07;56;01","And then they're in little tiny font. It's sentence not in the phenomenological like experiential, but greeting sort of all. Good to see you. But sentience in the setting in the sense of feeling, thinking and feeling systems without worrying about the first person experience side, at least in this paper. And then the key technical question of this paper, which broaches on to a million and a half other areas, is what is a marker blanket, just what are these blankets and how is one model identified to find statistically, what are the pros and cons of different approaches and so that's some of the technical details that we'll get to."
"Speaker 1","00;07;56;04","00;08;05;21","So Stephen, thanks for raising your hand and then welcome survival after that. Feel free to say hello and introduce yourself if you'd like I'm curious."
"Speaker 3","00;08;05;29","00;08;24;11","I notice here that we start with Cygnus, which I do agree is this big question of things is something that Carl first and brings up quite a lot. But I think he's often he's the he in that part, I feel is often a bit of a lone voice in terms of really pushing the thing, this side of things."
"Speaker 3","00;08;24;23","00;08;49;16","And I think it's really interesting. That second question then is, OK, how does that speak to system sentience? And you see now we move into systems right? And signals sort of to me, it gives rise to systems and gives rise to sentience. However, I think it's thing is is still there. But I think this is still the game in some ways of being maintained."
"Speaker 3","00;08;49;16","00;09;16;05","So that first question because when we then get into the third question, things can get lost and it's all about system sentience. And I think there's something really interesting there because there is a question of I mean, even as we say in those brackets, what it really means to have system sentience or even just system is probably rather ill defined."
"Speaker 3","00;09;16;15","00;09;33;17","And I suppose to some extent is how much is it even needed, how much can Cygnus be maintained as an equal partner in the game and not sort of passed over once we scale. So I think that's a good, good piece of provocation thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;09;33;17","00;09;46;13","And to what extent can things and systems be identified in a bottom up way from measurements of dynamical systems? Serval Would you like to add anything or say hello or partial."
"Speaker 4","00;09;49;13","00;09;54;19","No, I'm terrible. I'm a complexity scientist."
"Speaker 2","00;09;55;00","00;09;58;13","I have found in the system a theory which is interested in building up."
"Speaker 4","00;09;59;05","00;10;01;29","An active models of social or political changes."
"Speaker 2","00;10;01;29","00;10;16;14","And I'm here to see the discussion around the symbolism of the paper, which I did not revise, and I therefore cannot make informed comments on thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;10;16;14","00;10;17;28","Serval. Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;10;19;13","00;10;45;22","I just want to add one thing to what Steve was talking about there. I think what the big questions and what this paper addresses pretty directly is can we can we accept a minimum of two, that there's an abstraction and that there's a material aspect to thing this and and and marrying those two things is kind of what we're hoping to be able to do."
"Speaker 2","00;10;46;07","00;11;10;11","But but it comes in two very discrete forms. So so what of that? We call it this because it kind of spans both realms. And that's what I think I take away from the idea that can be chaotic and not absolutely."
"Speaker 1","00;11;10;19","00;11;51;29","There's the map in the territory. And one thing that we're going to return to is like the first map that we apply to the territory. So already we're separating the territory in the map, but even the first map can be chaotic. And then can we put a second map, the laplacian approximation, as it turns out in the paper, can that second map be one that gives us some properties that make it more tractable to handle like, you know, potholders taking something hot out of the oven, give a better grip on the first map, which gives a better grip in terms of actionable insight into the territory."
"Speaker 1","00;11;52;11","00;12;07;27","Can that second level both be more tractable, especially using computers, but also retain those chaotic properties, which we're going to see when they estimate the lyapunov exponent of the proxy an approximation so that."
"Speaker 2","00;12;08;08","00;12;17;28","That's the recursion prior to the the repetitiveness. That's what I think this really gets into recursion modeling thinking."
"Speaker 1","00;12;17;28","00;12;18;16","So Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;12;20;07","00;12;49;21","Yeah, I'm going to put this is maybe a little bit of a question as well. It's rhetorical if it doesn't want to be answered. But I think that the thinness and the mark of a blanket because we're getting to that stage here, there is this place. I think there's tends to be a sense that, OK, we have a thing because it's it's trying to sort of maintain itself and it just dissipates if world, then it's effectively a system because it's got micro blanket network."
"Speaker 3","00;12;50;01","00;13;36;10","But with this it's like, well, you've got the men's attractor, then the men's attractor goes into thinness. Right now, and then Cygnus potentially goes into probably with a few phases, system sensing system. So the question is which side of the which side of thing? This is mark of blanket. This mark or blanket emerge from from going from the men's attractor into thinness and then continue or is it is like the men's attractor into thing this into Markov in blanketed thing this I'm curious what your thoughts are on that and maybe this paper might shed some light on that great question."
"Speaker 1","00;13;36;10","00;14;06;15","Let's look at the roadmap and just see how that comes into play. So we talked in 32.1 about a few different ideas and we have some slides ready with just tabula rasa if we'd like to add notes or we can always modify slides and deal with questions as people are raising them. Let's go to the roadmap though. OK, so the the roadmap of the paper is as follows in section one, there's an introduction."
"Speaker 1","00;14;06;15","00;14;40;21","In Section two, there is from dynamics to densities. So this is one of the really fundamental kind of linking events early in the paper where dynamical systems dynamics are linked to flow systems like densities. So this equivalence between dynamical systems and density driven systems is going to be finessed extensively in the paper. So that's an introductory step that's very important to note."
"Speaker 1","00;14;41;15","00;15;30;10","The Helmholtz decomposition is a tool from vector calculus that applies very well to densities and flows where it's usually applied. But because of what links were made in Section two, it becomes possible to take that Helmholtz decomposition approach to dynamical systems. That is specifically visited and revisited and then moved beyond in the Lorenz system. That's one of those classical chaotic systems and a favorite toy of complexity analysis the Lorenza system is moved beyond and then approximated with a laplacian and then even moved beyond there so that's pretty much where we got to last week."
"Speaker 1","00;15;30;21","00;15;56;20","We tried to do a really solid grounding in first the equivalence between dynamical systems and density driven systems or two kind of representations of underlying systems that could be seen as equivalent. And then we talked about the Lorenzo system and about how it's chaotic and how chaotic means like sensitivity to small changes as quantified by the by the LA and exponents."
"Speaker 1","00;15;57;17","00;16;19;26","And then we talked about how the Laplacian approximation, which is kind of like fitting a quadratic, which is kind of like letting the ball roll to the bottom of the ball. And this idea of like, well, if we can phrase the problem like a ball, then all we have to do is roll to the bottom. There's only one bottom and we know which slope we're on."
"Speaker 1","00;16;20;07","00;16;41;13","So that's also called convex optimization because no matter where you are, if you know that the problem is shaped like a quadratic curve, like a ball, you can just instantaneously estimate the slope of the ball and then just run downhill whereas if you're on a rugged landscape, just, you know, you're lost in a mountain region will go downhill."
"Speaker 1","00;16;42;06","00;17;06;03","You're going to get trapped into a valley potentially, and you might not make it out to the ocean. But if you could reimagine that rugged landscape in a way that was more bold, like it would allow for tractable estimation of which way to move in section four, we get to the Markov blanket concept and the free energy principle."
"Speaker 1","00;17;06;13","00;17;32;09","And I think that's going to be the really fascinating discussion is like, OK, so let's get what that Markov blanket, what is that partitioning? What are we really talking about? And then are we talking about the territory? Are we talking about the Laurens map or are we talking about the Laplacian map? Where is this blanket partition thing coming into the picture?"
"Speaker 1","00;17;32;23","00;17;56;27","And then how does that help us reduce our uncertainty about systems and what does it say or not about that underlying system? And that's where we're going to be talking about particular partitions. Of course, a favorite and recurrent pun, which is that particular means specific but also it means like a particle, like a autonomous particle drifting around in space."
"Speaker 1","00;17;57;15","00;18;21;26","And then Section five really comes to a culmination with a discussion of the free energy principle alone. And so I think it'll be interesting to discuss like what is subsumed into the free energy principle and why do we need one section and blankets and free energy principle and then another section on just the free energy principle. So that's kind of the roadmap."
"Speaker 1","00;18;22;13","00;18;23;20","Steven and Andy."
"Speaker 3","00;18;25;06","00;19;00;29","Yeah, yeah. Just a quick question. See if this clarifies something which I think is what you're saying. Dynamics is the dynamics more particular flow and densities. While you could have a density of particles, it's actually more like a probability density on wave functions. Would I be right in thinking this is kind of a wave particle or part actually a particle, then wave way into this, and that's partly how they're playing this out."
"Speaker 1","00;19;02;27","00;19;30;13","Someone with more experience with the formalism would be totally open to their contributions. On that question, my first take would be you could make dynamical systems model like equations of motion for a particle floating around. And so it's like you're focusing on the first, second and third derivatives of movements in X, Y, Z space or tetrahedral space for some particle."
"Speaker 1","00;19;30;13","00;20;02;02","So a dynamical system model could be describing the movement of a particle but the low that gives rise to the movement of that particle is it's kind of like figure in ground, like the dynamical equation features the movement of that particle, like I want to know the pendulum's location. And so that's going to be a dynamical model of the pendulum, whereas the flow based models, like you pointed out, are much more about, well, what is the underlying space of the flow of that pendulum?"
"Speaker 1","00;20;02;06","00;20;38;06","So it's like if it's to the left of the bottom, it's like it flows this way. And if it's to the right, it's like it flows that way. And so that is about asking what is the underlying flow dynamics that do give rise to movement of potentially particles? And those are why this meme is on the slide and why they are made in equivalence early in the paper, because it is like talking about the difference between the movements of a point through a space versus understanding the flow dynamics of that space that yes, does give rise to the movement of particles."
"Speaker 3","00;20;39;12","00;21;03;17","And could I just ask one? So what if almost it goes from a just purely the, you know, the momentum of a particle to this flow and the flow is kind of a bridge then between density dynamics, which is maybe more of a probability density of where it could be, which can map both to an object where an object might be, but also where a wave function might be in broad sense."
"Speaker 3","00;21;03;17","00;21;18;08","So then you're sort of going from literal particles in a classical sense to the flow, and then the flow then bridges into density dynamics, which is can be more probability orientated. Is that fair to say?"
"Speaker 1","00;21;19;03","00;21;46;13","Yes. Particle is going to take a particular year, meaning a little bit later when we talk about the partitioning of states, but I believe that's correct. And also the density like you suggested ties much more closely to statistical density distributions. Like in statistics, we're often interested in density distributions of a special type like the area under the distribution."
"Speaker 1","00;21;46;17","00;22;25;16","Summing to one, the integral over a distribution being one allows us to treat it like a probability distribution. And so that's the whole debate in quantum. Is it actually a wave or does that distribution of positional uncertainty merely describe our statistical inference on the location of something that's at a specific point? So whichever side we want to come at this from Section two says it's going to be OK to use both and we're going to sometimes lean more on our left leg and sometimes we're going to lean more on our right leg because there's tools that exist for one, but not the other."
"Speaker 2","00;22;26;00","00;22;50;01","Dean Yeah. I don't know this against answer Steven's rhetorical question, but I think where most people get introduced to a markup like it, they get introduced to the idea that it's either a way of partitioning and dividing or it's a way of being able to envelop or blanket. And I think what the paper points out is that it's both all the time."
"Speaker 2","00;22;50;01","00;23;13;17","So you could, for example, find a box of cookies and see all the cookies settling at the bottom, whereas or at the person who's, you know, described as being creative uses that box of cookies as a leverage point to get more cookies off the top shelf. Now it's a platform and now it's a mount. And so we can see it both ways at once if we think of it as both ways."
"Speaker 2","00;23;13;21","00;23;33;28","And what's not an oral question is that minimum of two piece again, that that is really fascinating about this. That really kind of blows people up. It's really both at once. Then you decide which is going to be and that's what I think is really fascinating for people who just sort of start getting into this because they they've been so habituated to saying, oh, it's, it's a cookie jar."
"Speaker 2","00;23;34;17","00;23;38;15","Oh, it's a platform. No, it's both and that's that's what we want to do."
"Speaker 1","00;23;39;15","00;24;01;00","Thanks. Dean and Marco in the chat wrote like a boat in a stormy sea. It moves at the mercy of the seas. And winds flowing forces with only its rudder sails and other limited mechanisms to steward the world's influence on its journey. So Bucky Meme one unity is plural at minimum two Bucky Meme two on his gravestone call me Trim Tab."
"Speaker 1","00;24;01;02","00;24;20;10","Kind of like the letter. And that is exactly getting at the point of this paper, which is if we just were talking about a dust molecule floating in the air, then we could say, well, we could use the dynamical systems model of the position of the dust particle, or we could do inference on the flow of the room."
"Speaker 1","00;24;20;28","00;25;11;15","And that gives us a different and complementary, totally excellent picture but that's a dust molecule. What about active systems that have affordances that are able to do inference on action selection, choose different policies? How do those active systems do inference? That's the winged snowflake, that's the moth to the flame. And those are the really exciting systems. And that also speaks to the difference between what's called mere active inference, like the particle where we can still have this partitioning and still see it as a dynamics or a flow versus the adaptive active inference, which is then we're thinking about those systems where the particle, the particular states are able to effect different policies and select between"
"Speaker 1","00;25;11;15","00;25;19;27","them in a way that acts as if it's resisting dissipation. And those are the kind of exciting systems that we want to get to by the end of the paper."
"Speaker 3","00;25;20;04","00;25;49;11","Stephen And Colin, on the idea of the cookie jar, is this the the cookie jar is maybe almost a particle, a thing that is like leveraged and there's a thing ness which it becomes. So it's a it has a thing about it, but there's a thing this of being an affordance. So this is an interesting just sort of came to me."
"Speaker 3","00;25;49;11","00;26;18;28","But the thing is in itself, is slightly emergent because there's only by the process of trying to use it to get the higher cookie does another kind of thing emerge which becomes a step. So there's something interesting there about the ness as, as, as an emergent, you know, is it ever a step really. But it's always it's never not a thing at the same time."
"Speaker 3","00;26;18;28","00;26;26;07","So there's a I think there's something quite interesting there and that emergent stroke blows stroke in a literal sense."
"Speaker 1","00;26;27;10","00;27;02;02","And also I don't know to what extent this is intentional, but thinness. We talk a lot about an excess, the non equilibrium steady state or non equilibrium stationary states and so it's like the things ness. That's the thing. The thing we're talking about is the things ness. So we're not talking and saying that the system is at stationary, we're saying that the things ness by virtue of how we're modeling it has stationary characteristics."
"Speaker 1","00;27;02;29","00;27;28;28","And that is the thing as we model it, which is that always existing difference between the map in the territory. We're not saying that the territory is even a thing. We're saying the way we're relating and interacting with the map, which we totally made, no one's going to deny that that maps things ness is tractable. I can hold the map in my hands."
"Speaker 1","00;27;29;04","00;27;31;16","That gives me better grip on my road trip."
"Speaker 3","00;27;32;26","00;28;13;27","Stephen that's severe. Yeah. I think also the, the thing this can tie in to the idea that something ontologically comes into being through relation to some sort of network dynamic in which it acts and that actually that speaks to this leavens a tractor, you know, so the lens becomes part of a network of an ontology of thing which is really a thing in relation to what some other thing is like, you know, because obviously the scale of the cookie box is quite a lot different to the scale of the atoms in the cookie box or the whatever scale we want to."
"Speaker 3","00;28;14;07","00;28;44;20","So there's the, and then there's some sort of affordance level and maybe we can get out of the whole sensing system thing and it's like it's just an affordance for the thing this to maintain the thing, this doesn't need to know about systems as such unless someone, some creature happens to evolve a brain which starts to sit down, working out system diagrams two legged ones potentially, but otherwise it's like it's just things all the way up, right?"
"Speaker 1","00;28;46;26","00;29;31;15","Let's now that were 30 fun minutes in let's sprints up to that Markov cliff and then see where we go so Fig. one of the paper is kind of making this first fundamental connection between the Lorenz system as defined by dynamical equations. So the traditional Lorenz is defined more like the blue version within equations of motion. Well it has a positively opposite exponent which is to say that very closely located points diverge much rather than stay in like a laminar flow parallel line world or converging."
"Speaker 1","00;29;31;24","00;30;06;02","So they diverge and that's what makes Lorenz system chaotic ergo difficult to predict given measurement error and tiny perturbations due to even thermal noise, which is like kind of how pseudo random number generators work. And then there's going to be an approximation based upon this stochastic solution and so the trajectory and the right panel here, it's the deterministic solution to the laplacian form of Lorenz based upon the Helmholtz decomposition."
"Speaker 1","00;30;06;17","00;30;20;08","And so this is sort of like the version on the right that's usually seen in the state space model is almost like we're sampling stochastic li from points along that racetrack. So that was figure what we would."
"Speaker 3","00;30;20;08","00;30;40;10","You just if you just explain that, just go over that one more time. Just to clarify that bit, I think I understand what you're saying, but it's kind of an important point you make there when you say deterministic solution that I didn't there is that window just to clarify what that means."
"Speaker 1","00;30;41;14","00;31;21;23","So the deterministic solution would have no noise so that the position at the following time is entire really determined by the non stochastic state that it's in at the preceding moment. Whereas when we talk about a stochastic form it's like that's like your cars driving and there's thermal vibrations on the road. Now, the lyapunov exponent on that car at nonzero temperature is small so that the flow term dominates the vibratory term."
"Speaker 1","00;31;22;05","00;31;44;00","But there could be some other system where the difference between if it's in the absolute zero world and just on the road, then it's going to go straight. But once you introduce any wiggling, when the system is chaotic, it has that positive, the opposite exponent, then the tiniest wiggle causes the system to diverge."
"Speaker 3","00;31;45;18","00;32;12;24","That's really helpful because so basically normally we just like with a deterministic thing, it's just whatever the initial conditions, if it varies slightly, but then once it runs, it will settle into something. But if you you've got the initial condition and you've got the perturbations due to noise as it's actually running, which as I suppose you could say, a little bit of an extra change in initial conditions to each state that the lens attracts is moving through."
"Speaker 3","00;32;12;24","00;32;15;00","So OK, that's that's helpful. Thanks, Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;32;15;02","00;32;41;28","Yes. And I'm going to just show this image. This is I don't know if it's the very, very first, but this is the image that Lorenz used to talk about chaos in 1961. So I mean what's the difference between 76.8 and 76.85. It's imperceptible. If your thermometer only had like three significant figures, you wouldn't even be able to talk about the difference."
"Speaker 1","00;32;42;09","00;33;13;11","But I mean how different can it be? And it turns out that these, those two systems start in perceptibly different, but nearby points in chaotic systems do diverge and so it's like, OK, but they're still tracking each other, right? It's like, well no wrong later on. And so of course a more chaotic system with a more positively operative exponent diverges faster, but any system with a positive leading the option of exponent is going to have divergence."
"Speaker 1","00;33;13;25","00;33;56;14","And so if you have a purely deterministic system or one without this kind of the option of induced chaos, then you can predict far out. However, prediction matter experts as Dean, I'm sure, will revisit us to meet their match with chaotic systems. And that's actually one thing I hope that we get to by the end, which is that by putting action in every loop and inference on action, we can still, whichever of these timelines we end up on, we're going to be doing OK because we're always readjusting our inference to whichever of these mountains we're on."
"Speaker 1","00;33;56;14","00;34;15;21","It's not like one of these is better or worse or more or less challenging. Like they have the exact same upper and lower bound. The only mistake would be to make a prediction and be super confident about it and be on the wrong predictive timeline. But as long as we're always updating our predictions, then either of these days are going to be OK."
"Speaker 1","00;34;16;06","00;34;33;07","But if we put on the jacket because we thought that it was going to be cold here and that's when it was hottest, then we're injured. But if we just think, OK, well, we know we have the jacket afford, and so we're just going to keep an eye on that as we watch the temperature and continue to update our predictions, maybe then it'll be OK."
"Speaker 1","00;34;36;10","00;35;21;20","So that was the initial Lorenz attractor. Section three goes into the Helmholtz decomposition, which we've talked about in several other streams, and we've seen it introduced as the breaking down of a vector field. The total current in this kind of electromagnetic representation into the irritation, which is kind of like the straight line. There's no rotation in those straight lines and the purely rotational solenoid or current flow currency we've talked about solenoid or in gradient partitioning and then what this paper does and I think the technical details are in the Appendix B of 16."
"Speaker 1","00;35;21;20","00;36;05;07","So that was the Bayesian Mechanics paper and then also there's this housekeeping, big lambda, and that's in one of the appendices to this paper. So that would be like something for someone else to help us understand a little bit of because it does matter and it's actually a key contribution because if the landscape is changing moment to moment, you can't just do the Helmholtz decomposition once and sail on that sea without updating your estimate of the partitioning here, of the decomposition here that decomposition."
"Speaker 1","00;36;05;07","00;36;35;05","So again, dynamical systems, that's like the position of the car and then we're going to because of Section two, be having an equivalence between that dynamics and the flow modeling. And one of the terms that shows up on both of these is the fancy fancy I it's the self information. The first part performs a reminder in gradient descent on the negative log of the steady state density, which can be interpreted as self information."
"Speaker 1","00;36;35;18","00;37;15;24","So how surprised should one be to be at a given location relative to expectation? So we talked about how like the potential energy of the ball higher up on the ball is higher and then the potential function drops. And that's the physical analogy to this more informational statistical distribution approach to the self-insure position. And then in 3.1 that self information is going to be pursued and expanded upon for a, a relatively more simple case."
"Speaker 1","00;37;16;09","00;37;39;08","So we're going to identify due to the Helmholtz decomposition that there's this key variable which can be interpreted as like a potential function corresponding to the self's appraisal and that self appraisal term may have functional forms so we can have a function that describes how surprised we should be."
"Speaker 3","00;37;39;28","00;38;06;23","Stephen Yeah. If you could go to that last slide, the previous one there that I think this is quite useful. So the Focker plank, if it's an equilibrium which we're not because we're doing non equilibrium steady state, but if it were then it would be zero basically is that equilibrium is not changing so there's no, there's no divergence because it's zero."
"Speaker 3","00;38;07;20","00;38;28;23","And then he's taking this homo composition, which in a way is like a vector with a vector you've got, you know, it can split some things moving into X and Y. So this the gradient is coming out in the solenoid. It was at right angles to the gradient. So it's kind of like that trick that he does with accuracy and complexity."
"Speaker 3","00;38;29;11","00;38;56;14","You can say that there's a solenoid and gradient which go together for when it's still in a kind of a particular angular momentum sense. And then there's that ability to with the housekeeping to then move it into the flow, which I'm not entirely sure. I think that's the bit where we might need some quite what because flow could probably be more specifically thought about."
"Speaker 3","00;38;57;03","00;39;31;09","So now you've got this ability to sort of sort of structure through the kind of more particular context, the solenoids and gradient and then there's this transition to a more kind of general variable which can be just we don't need to get the particulars now because it's a variational metric that just gets used in an approximation sense and then follows into what you're saying would I be on the right tracks with that?"
"Speaker 1","00;39;31;27","00;39;56;12","I'm not sure who he is, even though I have an expectation because it's a multi-person paper but just looking at these as like circles and triangles and squares, we can see that upside down triangle, fancy eye of X is in both terms. So there's like a Q multiplied by something and then a gamma multiplied by something. And we see that omega is defined as like the Q minus the gamma."
"Speaker 1","00;39;56;26","00;40;27;23","So these two terms which were decomposed out from each other, get recombined into the final flow. So that's just like if it were like a times X minus B times X and then Omega were defined as a minus B times X. So we're re composing a flow equation that still features this fancy eye. And yes, we're solving that for a specific point that matters."
"Speaker 1","00;40;27;23","00;40;58;19","We want to solve that for where the balls at the bottom of the bowl. So there's a function that's going to tell us more or less in multiple ways, whether we're more or less away from the bottom of the ball and again, it's not about the system being at stationary, it's about this decomposition, having a Focker, Planck steady state dean."
"Speaker 1","00;40;58;19","00;40;59;28","So yes, it goes."
"Speaker 3","00;41;00;14","00;41;18;26","Just one quick thing. So at the bottom of the bowl, if we the gradient can effectively be zero, but solenoid or could still have a value because it can still be spinning around at the bottom of the bowl. But the gradient then because I notice the gradient term isn't in the flow, but the solenoid all term is."
"Speaker 1","00;41;19;08","00;41;32;05","A the gradient is because Q minus gamma is in omega. So Omega is this Omega Delta fancy is just these two terms combined."
"Speaker 3","00;41;32;19","00;41;33;19","OK, OK. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;41;33;28","00;41;34;08","Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;41;35;04","00;42;03;12","Yeah, I was just going to say what typically when this is brought forward, it's easier to understand the decomposition and the compiling if we view the blanket as a partition. Where it gets little bit more interesting is when the blanket is literally an envelopment and there's a, there's a physicist by the name of Keith Humphries who talks about emergence and he looks at that piece of it as well, because there's a polar aspect to this."
"Speaker 2","00;42;03;22","00;42;27;24","We can think of that in terms of positive and negative fields, magnetization and stuff like that, and how that is also a decomposition and a re compiling so I understand how it was presented in this paper. That's the partition way of looking at it, right? It's more or less. But there's also the positive and negative polar piece to this."
"Speaker 2","00;42;27;24","00;42;53;05","When we look at the mark of blanket as a blanket as opposed to a separator. And again, if we're holding up two things at once, this this doesn't just just change that. It just making sure that we hold both things up at once. The envelopment and the divider. I just want to bring that out there because again, we can we can see it easier as a partition like the skin as a partition."
"Speaker 2","00;42;53;09","00;42;58;11","We don't typically see the skin as a platform for sunscreen. That's my point."
"Speaker 1","00;42;59;25","00;43;00;26","Thanks, Steve. Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;43;02;29","00;43;32;17","You know, this, this, this this is a good point in terms of you can imagine at first I was thinking about gradient. You know, it's obvious that you've got a gradient that you can pass through maybe where the gradient zero, but also solenoid or flow. I suppose if if things are moving around this way and then it starts to turn and it starts to go the other way at some point, the solenoid flow is also passing through a zero so they can both pass through a zero point."
"Speaker 3","00;43;32;17","00;43;35;18","It just wasn't as intuitive when I first thought about it."
"Speaker 1","00;43;36;04","00;44;05;15","Yeah, and even if you have something that's spinning around like something that's spinning in a circle like a hammer thrower, it's actually continual acceleration. That doesn't mean it's speeding up. It means that the vector is continually changing. So now our map is of that acceleration and it is unchanging in how it changes. So that is to say that the system can have added in a different way of thinking about it."
"Speaker 1","00;44;05;28","00;44;29;17","Yes, a solenoid or component. We're not saying that balls at the bottom of balls are dead and unmoving we're saying in our map there's only one point because we set it up to be like a ball map where the derivative is zero that's the solution where the rate of change is zero. So that's not to say that the system isn't moving."
"Speaker 1","00;44;29;23","00;45;06;24","That's to say that the flow steady state has been achieved in figure four. Well, in FIG. three, we see the three states. So this is like the cover of the book, like kind of three different projections from a three dimensional system. The second versus the third, first versus the third and the first versus the second. And we're seeing how there's movements of sampled trajectories and they're kind of coming back to something that's ball like for any set of two dimensions."
"Speaker 1","00;45;07;09","00;45;52;23","So it's kind of like a three dimensional ball now because any two of these dimensions, it's more like a regular bowl, the kind of soup goes in, but then like the Super Bowl is like a down projection of a system that has an attractor in a higher dimension, potentially a much higher dimension. But Lorenzo, they're only modeling three because the particle only moves in three dimensions when we continue to investigate the bowl like properties of our Laplacian approximation to that Lorenz system, we see that there's a few different shapes of balls depending on which angle we're going to shine the flashlight from."
"Speaker 1","00;45;53;13","00;46;22;12","Some of them are like spherical so a spherical ball doesn't have any specific correlation between the two dimensions. It's like a cloud of points. The regression is just like flat through it. However, there are some couplings where the ball is non random, so it's almost like if we were tracking the movement of a ball, it's getting jostled around in these balls."
"Speaker 1","00;46;22;24","00;46;41;27","Well, like the one of the first and third if that was the light we were shining, it would just look like it was a scatterplot, as are totally the regressions flat. There's not much information being provided. It's it's within the ball. So already has some nice dynamics, but it's kind of within that attractor zone. It's a scatter. There's no pattern."
"Speaker 1","00;46;42;13","00;47;05;14","But clearly for the first and the second, we see that there is a coupling. Now imagine if we didn't see the ball because of course we don't. It's not there. That's part of our map. We're just seeing the movement of that ball as we sample it through time. And it would be only on this manifolds kind of being like spending more time going from the top left to the bottom right in these images."
"Speaker 1","00;47;06;21","00;47;35;19","So we're going to take that idea and then connect it to the Jacobian and the Hessian, which is again throwback to our Matrix Math slide and an awesome opportunity for anyone who wants to bring more of a technical interpretation to the stream the jacobian is like the first. The unnamed matrix is just like the matrix of position. So that's like the first moment of the distribution."
"Speaker 1","00;47;36;03","00;47;59;11","And then higher moments are like the partial derivatives. So Jacobian is like the first order, partial derivative so that's like the slope of the ruler at that point. And then the ocean is the second partial derivative. That's like the curvature. So if it's a ball there's only one point where it's flat and then it could be flat and the ball could be like up or the ball could be upside down."
"Speaker 1","00;47;59;26","00;48;26;21","And so that's why it's important to also have this second curvature term to understand whether we're at a ball like this or ball like that. So that's kind of like calculus and those balls, those ball attractor shapes which we're inferring using the laplacian quadratic assumption. So it's not saying that the Lorenz has these processes. These is these, it's saying that's the approximation that we're going to make."
"Speaker 1","00;48;28;19","00;48;58;13","It turns out that although there's somewhat of an unclear correlation pattern in the first derivatives, so like the movement to the left, it's not like it's correlated with movement up however, the second partial derivative, the hessian matrix, starts to look a lot like the covariance matrix. So the actual positional covariance of these states with each other. So like the on diagonal is kind of obvious."
"Speaker 1","00;48;58;13","00;49;33;03","Like of course your position on the x axis is is correlated well with your position on the x axis, but there are correlations between state one and two and that is recapitulated in the structure of the second order polynomial approximation to these attractors that are laplacian approximations so again, up until that point in 3.5 and in figure six, Markov has not been introduced nothing has been said."
"Speaker 1","00;49;33;14","00;49;53;04","That word hasn't come into play. It didn't come into the systems definition. And so that's just really important because it's just showing like there's a lot of groundwork to get to where we make the Mark Colvin partitioning. And so there's power and challenge in that."
"Speaker 3","00;49;53;08","00;50;28;03","Steven Would I be correct in saying that effectively? So it's a case of approximating the states of the Levin's attractor, and that's what's currently there. So this is different ways of showing that within some manifold state space. And by approaching it in different ways, it reveals a different type of approximation the only thing I would ask, I'm a little bit confused why those squish, maybe I'm missing something."
"Speaker 3","00;50;28;08","00;50;40;05","I can see why that be kind of around one and just trying to work out how it squishes. Is it something to do because of the solenoid or piece or the gradient piece or is there something else?"
"Speaker 1","00;50;41;06","00;51;24;08","OK, so if we were talking about just a particle undergoing Brownian diffusion in three dimensions, so it doesn't have any kind of correlations or any sort of structure, just it's just a random walk in three dimensions. Well then it would have a spherical error profile for all of these images. But we are capturing structure that exists because Lorenzo structure has a specific specification so the states are whichever are being modeled, if you care about pressure and volume, that's your state space, that two dimensional state space of the map it's not saying those are the only states of that system."
"Speaker 1","00;51;24;08","00;52;08;23","It just those are the ones that you're modeling. In the Lorentz system, we have three states. It's position in three dimensions, but those three dimensions again also apply to a Brownian diffusing particle, which has a difference jacobian, covariance and hessian. We're talking about those being calculated for the Laurens system with the parameters that they selected. And so we are pulling out CO variances and connecting it to this second order polynomial approximation in the motion for a system where the movement is not just a Brownian diffusion."
"Speaker 1","00;52;09;04","00;52;16;04","And so that's why their structure in the covariance and that's why the structure is interestingly recapitulated in the Russian dean."
"Speaker 2","00;52;17;18","00;52;47;22","Yeah. And Hollywood, Hollywood supplement that with this. Things, things. There we go. Things that are in something that's moving the thing that's moving that's in something that's moving that's on something that's moving has a tendency to have the negative charged things all congregate in one place down in the lower right corner and all the positive things all congregate in another place in the upper left corner."
"Speaker 2","00;52;47;27","00;53;18;27","That's the nature of movement. And so that polar part of it is in play as well. If we consider it as part of these statistical transitions. And that's again, it's it's fascinating if you if you look at it, a minimum of two things. So not just not just as a partition but also as an an envelope, those things suddenly pop out at you and you see the pattern in and in a different way."
"Speaker 1","00;53;19;29","00;53;38;07","So I want to think about a physical system that's not chaotic but will help us understand what this covariance matrix is. So let's think about a children's carousel. So it moves. The horsey is moving around in a circle. And so that's like our unit circle, like the four quadrants. And then also the horse is going up and down OK?"
"Speaker 1","00;53;38;16","00;53;55;04","So when you're, you know, so again, it's like, you know, if you were at 12:00 on the carousel, it's like you have a one for the Y and a zero for X OK, so hope that makes sense. Now as it goes around, it's like point five and point five. Again, just using simple numbers here, like."
