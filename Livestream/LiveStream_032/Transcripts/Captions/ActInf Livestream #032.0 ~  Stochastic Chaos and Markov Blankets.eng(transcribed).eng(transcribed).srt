00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,800
hello and welcome everyone to actin flab

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,440
live stream number 32.0

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,920
at the actin flab the paper we're

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
discussing is going to be stochastic

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
chaos and markov blankets and it's

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,640
november 7th

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,199
2021

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,000
let's play our theme

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:52,239
[Music]

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
welcome to the actinft lab everyone we

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
are a participatory online lab that is

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
communicating learning and practicing

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
applied active inference

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
you can find us at the links on this

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
page

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
this is a recorded and an archive live

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
stream so please provide us with

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
feedback so that we can improve on our

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,360
work

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
all backgrounds and perspectives are

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
welcome here and we'll be following

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
video etiquette for live streams

23
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
at this short link you can see our past

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,240
and upcoming live streams and here on

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
the main tab the live stream calendar

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
for 2021

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
we're here in early november we had our

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
fourth quarterly lab round table

29
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
summarizing the kinds of projects that

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
you can get involved in

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
and what we had done in the previous

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
year what we're looking forward to next

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119
year and then the first two weeks of

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
discussion are going to be on november

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
9th and 16th for this paper that will be

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
discussed tonight

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,479
in

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
stream number 33 we'll have abel's paper

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
thinking like a state and we haven't set

40
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,279
the papers yet for 34 and 35.

41
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
the goal of

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,479
32.0 is to learn and discuss this paper

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
stochastic chaos and markov's blankets

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
2021

45
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
by carl firsten connor hines kai

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,319
oldhofer lancelot decosta and thomas

47
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
parr and just like all the dot zeros

48
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
this is just an introduction to some of

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
the ideas it's not a review or a final

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
word and especially if you have any

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
experience

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
or you want to learn more about any of

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,599
these areas and help improve our

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
presentation or

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,959
understanding of it that'd be very

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
helpful you can join a live stream or

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
just come get involved in some of the

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,599
aspects of the lab because

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,560
these are things that we want to

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
understand but also there's a lot to

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
learn

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
and in the coming two weeks we're going

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
to discuss this paper

64
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
so i'm daniel and i'm in california

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,840
the big questions of this paper

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,720
are related to the general

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
discussion in the active inference and

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
free energy principle literature and

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,120
beyond what is a good model of thingness

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
in a chaotic dynamic and dissipative

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,480
world so do we think of things as as

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
they are in the snapshot or do we have

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
to think of them through time at what

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,720
spatial or temporal scale or with what

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
kind of measure stick does it make sense

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
to talk about things

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and then how does the result of that

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
first question this model or approach to

79
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
thickness speak to

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
system sentience which is going to be a

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
word that is used in this paper

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
and

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,959
notably this is not being defined in

84
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
terms of feeling like experiencing

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
it's

86
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
defined in the paper as where internal

87
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
states look as if they're inferring

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,120
external states so perhaps closer to

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
what dennett would call the intentional

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,480
stance

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
but this is sort of just pragmatism

92
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,840
meets

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
anti-dissipativism

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
third point what is a markov blanket and

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
how is one modeled and identified or

96
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
defined statistically this is going to

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,799
be

98
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
the technical

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
bulk and contribution

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
of the paper so

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,918
if

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,160
anyone wants to learn more and help us

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
present some of the technical details

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
which we're going to go through in this

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
lecture but total disclaimer if it's not

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
accurate or it's an incorrect

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
generalization

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,240
a word that wasn't a key word per se but

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
maybe is just a qualitative entry point

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,440
is this idea of flow and here we have

111
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
people flowing like a

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,400
long time exposure in a subway station

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
and there's water flow which has several

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
aspects the water itself is moving but

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
also there's the flow of energy

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
there's information flow and then

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
there's this psychological concept of

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
flow

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
and so

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
different aspects of these

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
could be said to be flowing in different

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,759
ways

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
and people jump across these different

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
areas so wouldn't it be cool if there

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
were a quantitative model that kind of

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
incorporated some of what was meant

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
by all these concepts including

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
a science of

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,039
perhaps perception cognition in action

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
so the big picture is how are we going

131
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
to connect kind of physical

132
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,160
flow

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
models

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
to potentially other kinds

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
like macro systems and informational and

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
even psychological or behavioral

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
paper is stochastic chaos and markov

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
blankets

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
2021

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
and uh

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
two of the aims and claims of the paper

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,080
of which there are definitely multiple

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
so this is just a few of them

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
in this work we attempt an end-to-end

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
derivation of a markov blanket starting

146
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
with a normal form of stochastic chaos

147
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
and ending with a functional form of a

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,759
synchronization map

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,280
the second

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
aim

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
or like a summary of the paper is we

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
conclude with the discussion of the

153
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
implications and generalizations of the

154
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
following heuristic

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,919
so not necessarily formal but more like

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,720
using empirical simulation

157
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
or approximation proof of principle for

158
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,199
understanding simulating and

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
characterizing an elemental form of

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
sentience in systems that self-organize

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
to non-equilibria

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
so that is where sentience comes in and

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
again this isn't

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
saying that because we did some matrix

165
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
math

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
we think it has phenomenological

167
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
awareness sentience is going to be more

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
like intentional stance

169
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
it's resisting dissipation perhaps it's

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
acting strategically given the

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
affordances in its niche

172
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
so one really relevant paper

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,080
for stochastic chaos and markov blankets

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,039
is

175
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
the paper bayesian mechanics for

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
stationary processes with multiple of

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
the same authors

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
and um this one was put on archive on

179
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
june 25th 2021

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
and then this one looks like it was

181
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
received by the journal

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,120
at

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
july 9th 2021 so

184
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,599
one

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
question is like to to what extent are

186
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
these complementary

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,560
are these requisite or are they

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
somehow related to each other or are

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
they two independent

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
kind of dimensions of advance

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
there's some overlapping areas but also

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
there's some different areas so that

193
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,919
would be good to

194
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,479
learn about

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,479
so there's the keywords of the paper

196
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
were bayesian thermodynamics

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,160
information geometry

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
variational inference and markov blanket

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
so let's go just

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
one level deeper into the flow example

201
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,960
we have a lot of

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
fields like

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
math physics information computing

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,759
thermodynamics geometry

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
a few other fields

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
where there are models of physical flow

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
so

208
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
everything from heat engines and heat

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,440
flow to

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,479
quantum

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,039
and classical computation

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,680
clouds and everything else so

213
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,039
this is a engineering experience

214
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
and ontology

215
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
and um from multiple different areas of

216
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
mathematical formalisms that sometimes

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
map very closely to the real world or

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
not

219
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,599
then

220
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
there's these again flow

221
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,958
models

222
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,080
or process models for mental flow for

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
example thinking about attentional

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
allocation or informational processing

225
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,080
and

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,800
the big idea which is proposed

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,519
in

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,360
fristen at all 2006 at least one

229
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
phrasing of it in an image that gets

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
referenced back many times is this idea

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
of like a winged snowflake

232
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,240
and so

233
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
below the phase boundary so above

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
the temperature of melting ice

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
the droplets are unable to

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,959
enact policy so they simply

237
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
fall from phase

238
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
and then they become rain

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,080
but above the solid phase boundary

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
so

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
below the freezing point of water

242
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
there are the snowflake structures so

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
there's an organization

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
and then

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
one can imagine that if this shape above

246
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
the phase boundary

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
is able to enact action on the

248
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
environment

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
first if nothing other than

250
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
by chance

251
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
you would find that there'd be for

252
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
example persistence of the most adaptive

253
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
action policies

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
so that is the exchange

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
and the interfacing of active systems

256
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,440
with their environment that precludes

257
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
the phase transition so that's the

258
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
winged snowflake example

259
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
of

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
early er fristen

261
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
and it will come back at the end in a

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
pretty interesting way

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
so one of the first keywords is bayesian

264
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
here's rev bays and we've talked a lot

265
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
about bayesian things so just to kind of

266
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
pick a few new images

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
here's some overlapping

268
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
between frequentism

269
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,040
here

270
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,680
and bayesianism here and

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
some of the overlap so it's just kind of

272
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,360
interesting to look at

273
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
and what exactly does it mean for a

274
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
theory or for statistics to be bayesian

275
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
explicit modeling of priors

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,880
and here's the sort of classic

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
bayes theorem which

278
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
i'm just not going to go into right now

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
i'm sure there's awesome resources to

280
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
learn more about bayesian statistics

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
and just sort of the way that it becomes

282
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
meaningful is just embodied how we want

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,839
to be able to bring our full knowledge

284
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,880
to bear

285
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
on scientific questions or any other

286
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,560
kind of question we want to be able to

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
integrate different kinds of data sets

288
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
and have models that can be able to

289
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
receive data as well as generate it

290
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,000
these things are all tractable in modern

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
bayesian

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
frameworks

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
thermodynamics is the quoting wikipedia

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
here branch of physics that deals with

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
heat work and temperature and the

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
relation to energy radiation and

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
physical properties of matter

298
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,519
so there's this sort of thermodynamic

299
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
patterns or laws in the way that they

300
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
relate to statistical mechanics so how

301
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
the kind of jostling of molecules

302
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
leads to the ideal gas law

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
or

304
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
kind of work

305
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
capacity in

306
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
temperature

307
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
engines

308
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
and then just looking around there was

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,639
kind of just some old ideas some new

310
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,680
ideas

311
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,040
so this is something we've talked about

312
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
before with

313
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
decision making but also

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
it's um

315
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
how we think about chemical reactions in

316
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
terms of

317
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
the lower activation energy is the

318
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
kinetic product that's like the one that

319
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
is easily jostled to

320
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,200
and then the one that has a higher

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
uh activation energy is not favored to

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
occur but then it sometimes can be like

323
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
a lower thermodynamic product so

324
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
releasing more delta g

325
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,519
and then

326
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,360
if we're going to have some sort of an

327
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
information thermo synthesis

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,279
what does

329
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,639
delta g

330
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
informationally look like like what is

331
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
the informational

332
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,959
imperative

333
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
the title of the paper has stochastic

334
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,600
chaos

335
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
so just

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,079
found a few

337
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,959
different

338
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
citations on it

339
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
and it's an idea that

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,920
has been going back since before 2000s

341
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,160
so i don't know when the exact beginning

342
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
was but it's been around so that was

343
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
just one

344
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
question for uh the authors or for

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
anyone who's knowledgeable about it what

346
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,279
is uh the scope of stochastic chaos and

347
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,079
how

348
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
how do we

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,000
think about the relative

350
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,399
importance or meaning of

351
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
solving one category

352
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,839
of

353
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
dynamic systems

354
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
so what is stochastic chaos

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
stochastic

356
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
subject to probabilistic variation in

357
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
one way or another and we'll kind of

358
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
like look at multiple ways that that can

359
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
come into the picture through sampling

360
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,839
or approximation and then chaos which is

361
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
sensitivity to small changes which is

362
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
summarized

363
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
at least in one way by the lyopniv

364
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,040
exponent which is a measure of how

365
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
closely

366
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,959
separated points either converge or

367
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,518
diverge

368
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
as a feature of the shape

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,199
and the type of the matrices that

370
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,600
describe the systems

371
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
another keyword was information geometry

372
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
so

373
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,519
i'm definitely not the person to

374
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
give a specific definition

375
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
it would be great to learn more from

376
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,720
someone who could link this to the

377
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,399
specific

378
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,040
modern advances so a few people who have

379
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
emailed us

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
but uh john baez who is a professor in

381
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
the uc system

382
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,680
wrote

383
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
on

384
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,440
his site which has a whole curriculum on

385
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,360
information geometry

386
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
not that i've taken it but heard it was

387
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,480
good

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
information geometry is the study of

389
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
statistical manifolds which are spaces

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
where each point is a hypothesis about

391
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
some state of affairs

392
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,240
this subject usually considered a branch

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
of statistics has important applications

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
to machine learning and somewhat

395
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
unexpected connections to evolutionary

396
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
biology

397
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
so

398
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
this image

399
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,839
it just kind of was like if these are

400
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,120
dimensions of

401
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,199
something abstract

402
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,360
that projected down onto the graph paper

403
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,120
is going to look like a triangle

404
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
and then this shape which maybe is kind

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
of like a saddle shape or if the

406
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
two um distal parts are connected it's

407
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,399
like a tetrahedra in a way

408
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,440
then

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,519
that projected down from a specific

410
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,160
angle is going to look like a

411
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
right angled

412
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
square

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
but from a different angle it would have

414
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
a different profile

415
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,399
so the same tetrahedra

416
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,600
rotated

417
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,959
in different ways

418
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,680
can project down into a different

419
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
geometry

420
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,079
so

421
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
kind of interesting to think about that

422
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,720
with

423
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
information and if you're measuring

424
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
several axes of information you have an

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
informational tetrahedra

426
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
as if it doesn't need to be

427
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,800
saying that it is actually that way

428
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,360
one of the other keywords was

429
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
variational bayesian inference and this

430
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
was from the slides of 26

431
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
and some also good blog posts that

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
others have written

433
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
it

434
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
was defined in this blog post um by

435
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,440
variational inference methods that

436
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
consist uh consist in finding the best

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
approximation of a distribution

438
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
among a parameterized family so it's

439
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
kind of like finding the best linear

440
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
model for a data set this is a way to

441
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,399
fit more

442
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,600
complex

443
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
data

444
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
and models but it keeps it constrained

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
within a family so that you're just

446
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
tuning the knobs that you know

447
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,199
interact in a good way

448
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,279
versus all the possible degrees of

449
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,920
freedom in modeling which is basically

450
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,199
infinite

451
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,160
and then

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
two ways that bayesian approaches can

453
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,199
be deployed there's probably many more

454
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,720
than this too

455
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
there's the sampling based approach or

456
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,560
the monte carlo

457
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,440
like

458
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,519
gambling approach which is like

459
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,480
pointillism where it kind of samples and

460
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
then this if the underlying distribution

461
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
you're kind of agnostic to it if you run

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
this properly and the underlying

463
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
distribution has the right properties

464
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
you can sample something that's totally

465
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
adequate for making good decisions

466
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,160
and then the alternate approach is kind

467
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
of like the svg approach the variational

468
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
inference you kind of have a

469
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,400
library of cat or of mammal subunit

470
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,439
vectors

471
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,720
and then

472
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
that vector

473
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,360
set gets

474
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,000
fit in a way that's more tractable than

475
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
just this sort of endless sampling oh

476
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
what if there was a whole body and you

477
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
just missed it type questions however if

478
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
there was a whole body in your library

479
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
or the family of functions you were

480
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
trying to fit were only whole body

481
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
then uh

482
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
i mean

483
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
you can have a mismatch there just like

484
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,720
you could fit any other model

485
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
incorrectly

486
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
so the markov blanket is one of the um

487
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
terms that i think many people are

488
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
curious about certainly

489
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
ourselves included

490
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
and

491
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,039
from

492
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,080
number 14 livestream number 14

493
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
we talked about this continuum slash

494
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
development of the concept from

495
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,039
the way it was phrased by

496
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
markov by the way we're still trying to

497
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,640
figure out which one

498
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
uh

499
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,679
slash exactly which contribution the

500
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
father and the son made

501
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,120
towards the development in pearl 1988

502
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
in the

503
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
uh textbook

504
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
uh

505
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
shown here

506
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
and this is where computational methods

507
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
start to come in

508
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
and some of the pure math assumptions

509
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
get deployed in real data sets so then

510
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
the markov blanket is defined as the set

511
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
in a bayesian graph of insulating nodes

512
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
so moving from this matrix

513
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
representation towards this graphical

514
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,640
bayesian representation

515
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,919
and then

516
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,400
there's some of the developments by carl

517
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,559
fishton and others which this paper is

518
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,760
part of

519
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
that do a few different things relating

520
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,639
to connecting

521
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
separating the

522
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,760
blanketing states

523
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
into incoming sensory and outgoing

524
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,200
action

525
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,360
so partitioning of the blanket

526
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,880
as well as

527
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
implementing some of these components of

528
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
principle of least action which is not

529
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
implicit in just mere statistical

530
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
insulation on a bayesian graph so we'll

531
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
talk about some of that stuff but i

532
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
think there's enough to cover in what

533
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,559
this paper

534
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
here adds and

535
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
number 14 number 20 number 26

536
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
many other papers

537
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
that we've discussed in many that we

538
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,080
haven't have very insightful

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
uses as well as criticisms of markov

540
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,159
blanket concept

541
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
so what is the free energy principle

542
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:04,840
this

543
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
keyword one way to answer it since it's

544
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,559
a

545
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
keyword in many papers

546
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
what are three possible attentional

547
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,320
regimes that you might be able to expect

548
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,080
will reduce your uncertainty about this

549
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
question because if you're not worried

550
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
about this question

551
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
it's all good then but if you are you

552
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
want to reduce your uncertainty so what

553
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
are the actions to reduce your

554
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
uncertainty

555
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
well the third sentence of this paper

556
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
that we're discussing here is

557
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
in brief the free energy principle is a

558
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
variational principle of stationary

559
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
action

560
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
applied to a particular partition of

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
states

562
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
where this partition rests upon

563
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
conditional

564
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
independencies

565
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
which is the other side of the coin of

566
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
uh

567
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,679
which which things influence each other

568
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
and which don't kind of two sides of the

569
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,840
coin there

570
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,559
there's then a link to citation 15.

571
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,799
so citation 15 if you want to go one

572
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,880
more layer into

573
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
establishing whether this is a mereditus

574
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
claim or not

575
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,440
there's friston's 2019

576
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
monograph free energy principle for a

577
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,919
particular physics particular being

578
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
specific but also referring to

579
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
particular or autonomous states as

580
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
they're known

581
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,919
and also much discussion has occurred

582
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,000
since this paper so

583
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
look forward to seeing

584
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,799
how

585
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,000
it develops

586
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
and then a third possible attentional

587
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,159
regime would be to come participate and

588
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
contribute with actimflab because every

589
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,440
day

590
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,120
we are reducing our uncertainty about

591
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,919
terms as well as any participant can

592
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,200
attest

593
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
and we're always trying to improve our

594
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
informational niche through projects

595
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
like educational courses and ontology

596
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
development so that the questions that

597
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,320
people ask

598
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
every day like what is a markov blanket

599
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,960
why does it matter what is the fep why

600
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
does it matter

601
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,320
there will be awesome resources to share

602
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
about those questions

603
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
one other piece before we jump into the

604
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
paper is just a little bit of matrix

605
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
math vocabulary so i hope that i'm

606
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
just even quoting the definitions

607
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,120
correctly because i'm not super familiar

608
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
with a lot of these distinctions

609
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
and would think that there's a lot more

610
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
expertise that people could share which

611
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,960
would be awesome so the jacobian matrix

612
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,559
and the determinant

613
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,320
is a construct in vector calculus

614
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,559
and what's relevant here is that it's

615
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
the matrix of the first order partial

616
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
derivatives so if you have just like a

617
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
lump in space you can take the partial

618
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
derivative it's like putting a ruler and

619
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
finding the derivative of a certain axis

620
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
of a certain variable

621
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
at that spot

622
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
and so you can find the partial

623
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,799
derivatives of higher order

624
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
models

625
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,799
the hessian matrix

626
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,799
is defined as the square matrix of

627
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,360
second order partial derivatives

628
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,200
of a function or field

629
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
it describes the local curvature of a

630
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
function of many variables

631
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
so same idea it's like

632
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,799
how

633
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
the the linear slope and then also the

634
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,679
curvature so that can tell you a lot

635
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,640
in

636
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
especially

637
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
a certain case

638
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
that's going to come into play in how

639
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,039
this paper

640
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,200
defines its analysis approach

641
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
specifically the laplacian approximation

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
so the abstract

643
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,440
in this treatment of random dynamical

644
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,840
systems we consider the existence and

645
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
identification of conditional

646
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,919
independencies at non-equilibrium steady

647
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,520
state

648
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,440
these independencies underwrite a

649
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
particular partition of states in which

650
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
internal states are statistically

651
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
secluded from external states by blanket

652
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,520
states

653
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,679
the existence of such partitions has

654
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,880
interesting

655
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
implications for the information

656
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
geometry of internal states

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
in brief this geometry can be read as a

658
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
physics of sentience where internal

659
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
states look as if they are inferring

660
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,320
external states

661
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,279
however the existence of such partitions

662
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,480
and the functional form of the

663
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
underlying densities have yet to be

664
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
established

665
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,159
here

666
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
using the lorenz system as the basis of

667
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
stochastic chaos we leverage the

668
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,960
helmholtz decomposition and polynomial

669
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,360
expansions to parameterize the steady

670
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
state density in terms of surprisal or

671
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,720
self-information we then show how markov

672
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,120
blankets can be identified using the

673
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
accompanying hessian to characterize the

674
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,679
coupling between internal and external

675
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
states in terms of a generalized

676
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
synchrony or synchronization of chaos

677
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
we conclude by suggesting that this kind

678
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,559
of synchronization may provide a

679
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
mathematical basis for an elemental form

680
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,679
of

681
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,760
autonomous or active

682
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,120
sentence in biology

683
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
okay cool

684
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,480
how will that happen here's the road map

685
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
the first section is the introduction

686
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
the second section

687
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
from dynamics to densities makes the

688
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,480
connection between dynamical models

689
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,919
and

690
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,039
densities

691
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,600
which takes one towards flow like if you

692
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
have water in the ocean of different

693
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
temperature and densities you can do the

694
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
flow modeling

695
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
section three

696
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
is the helmholtz decomposition which

697
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
we've also revisited elsewhere

698
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
and it relates to

699
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
splitting apart a vector field into

700
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,320
two components one that's kind of like

701
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,840
hill climbing and one that's more like

702
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
curvature

703
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
the lorenz system a classic

704
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,240
complexity

705
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,279
model

706
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
is brought up

707
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
and

708
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
used as an initial case

709
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,080
for this kind of dynamics to densities

710
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,158
plus helmholtz decomposition

711
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
then some further

712
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
lorenz

713
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,960
systems other than the lorenz are

714
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,520
analyzed and then the laplace and

715
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,120
systems other than the laplace are

716
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
analyzed

717
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
section four markov blankets and the

718
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
free energy principle

719
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,559
talks about sparsely coupled systems and

720
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,520
specifically where the different

721
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,880
partitions are engaging in some type of

722
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
synchrony which is going to be like

723
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,559
correlated action conditioned upon the

724
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,960
blanketing states

725
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
that leads to a discussion of particular

726
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
partitions boundaries and blankets

727
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,480
and a kind of revisiting using a

728
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
simulation analysis of

729
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
markov blankets

730
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,960
the last section is about the free

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
energy principle and mentions active

732
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,840
inference so it's pretty

733
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,399
interesting

734
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
just to start with the data availability

735
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,960
statement they wrote that the code used

736
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
to run the simulations and create the

737
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,840
figures for the paper are freely

738
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,159
available in the dem toolbox of the

739
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,559
matlab package spm12

740
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,960
so if anyone maybe wants to

741
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
like do spm live with us

742
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
that who knows how to do it that'd be

743
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,679
awesome spm stream it's be great so

744
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
let's start with the introduction

745
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
slowly because there's going to be some

746
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,880
more technical parts later

747
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,600
the last sentence of the first paragraph

748
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
of the introduction

749
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
is

750
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
from this

751
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,720
one can elaborate a physics of sentience

752
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
or bayesian mechanics that would be

753
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,039
recognized in theoretical neuroscience

754
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,760
and biology so imagine if the top half

755
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,279
were redacted

756
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,320
what do you think would allow for quote

757
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,559
the elaboration of a physics of

758
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
sentience or a bayesian mechanics

759
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,760
so

760
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
not possible

761
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,480
or it's already been done who did it or

762
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
well it would have to have this

763
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
attribute it'd have to be able to run on

764
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
this type of computer or it'd have to

765
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,960
have this many variables or fewer so

766
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
what are we looking for here

767
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,039
what would justify

768
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,360
this sentence

769
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
that they start the paper with

770
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
and why would it matter which is kind of

771
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
tied up with maybe what would um be the

772
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
motivation for developing it however

773
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,840
much effort

774
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
it

775
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,679
involved why would it matter to have a

776
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,600
physics of sentience well

777
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,760
why did it matter to have a physics of

778
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
heat

779
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
let's pull back one more sentence

780
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
the internal states can then be cast as

781
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,279
representing in a probabilistic fashion

782
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,120
external states

783
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
so that's what they're going to

784
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,760
elaborate a physics of sentience on from

785
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
this partitioning of internal and

786
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
external states

787
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,600
but not just any partitioning

788
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,399
a particular partitioning where internal

789
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
states can be cast as representing

790
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,000
external states

791
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
so this is kind of a minimal

792
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,159
representation we have internal and

793
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,320
external states and we're not going to

794
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
define them as even action or sense

795
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,559
partitions in the blanket yet just

796
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,399
there's some partition between internal

797
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,200
and external states and the question is

798
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,159
is this

799
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,080
how you think the world is partitioned

800
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,520
or how our statistical models are

801
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,799
positioned what is this partition

802
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
and we've talked about that in a few

803
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,480
different papers and that's going to be

804
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
a big part of this paper

805
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
then we can pull back one more

806
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,919
sentences

807
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,080
in the abstract or i mean in this first

808
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,399
paragraph

809
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,000
where they define the free energy

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,679
principle which

811
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,559
were which we read previously and then

812
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,440
specifically if the states of a system

813
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
whose dynamics can be described with

814
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
random or stochastic differential

815
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,120
equation eg the length vine equation

816
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
possess a markov blanket then an

817
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
interesting interpretation of their

818
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
dynamics emerges

819
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
the conditional independence in question

820
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,279
means that a set of internal states are

821
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,159
independent of another external states

822
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
another external set when conditioned

823
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
upon blanket states

824
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,679
and so that is the blue here's the

825
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,039
precondition

826
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,880
for the red claim which is going to be

827
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,840
what is

828
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
the basis for

829
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,039
in the author's words elaborating a

830
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,440
physics or sentence so

831
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,760
that is kind of where we're going

832
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
in this paper

833
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
agree or disagree there's going to be a

834
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
lot of specific points where juan can

835
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,360
raise a qualm and that's totally okay

836
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,760
and i think a lot of the

837
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
discussion i hope will be very

838
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
interesting with people

839
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,840
seeing which parts of this presentation

840
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,440
resonate with them or their

841
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,000
understanding or not

842
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
those are the big questions what kind of

843
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
blankets line up with different parts

844
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,159
aspects or partitionings of the world

845
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,440
map is not the territory etc

846
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
what makes some partitionings in the

847
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,880
world act informationally like

848
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,519
inferentially anticipatory

849
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,679
predictively etc

850
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
why are some partitions able to be cpus

851
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
and other partitions are just

852
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,720
divided halves of a cup of water

853
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
how do partitionings of

854
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,000
variables that model the world

855
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,760
lead to a physics of sentience and

856
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,039
action

857
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,720
is there another way to get to a physics

858
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
of sentience and action

859
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,760
is there another way to do physics

860
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,360
they

861
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,799
describe

862
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,480
their approach to part one

863
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,080
by

864
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,559
applying the helmholtz decomposition

865
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
which

866
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,240
we're going to return to so this is just

867
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
kind of a a preamble and we'll talk more

868
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,240
about some of the keywords but

869
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,519
they're going to apply the helmholtz

870
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,919
decomposition to the solution of the

871
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,080
focker plank equation describing the

872
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,679
density dynamics of any random system

873
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,080
and then

874
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
later on they're still summarizing part

875
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,600
one and they're going to say we

876
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,840
approximate the flow

877
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
from the yellow part

878
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,519
with a quadratic expansion which means

879
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,679
the steady state density reduces to a

880
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,440
gaussian form

881
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,919
so it's kind of like if you fit a

882
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,440
quadratic model

883
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,159
ax squared plus bx plus c

884
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,039
to

885
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,799
some

886
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,559
data set

887
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,120
it's not a statement that the data set

888
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,960
is going to have a derivative that's

889
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,640
linear and then a derivative of that

890
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
that's a constant

891
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,399
that's not

892
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,320
part of the data set of the world that's

893
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
about the quadratic model which is a

894
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
very constrained model set that you

895
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,320
chose to fit

896
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,919
and maybe other models would have fit it

897
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,120
better other ones would have had more or

898
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,000
fewer parameters but you knew something

899
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,760
about the form of the solution because

900
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
you constrained it to a certain set of

901
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
parameterized equations which is why

902
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,880
they talk about variational inference

903
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
and then

904
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
they're going to show that for a lorenz

905
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,880
system

906
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
subject to appropriate random

907
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
fluctuation

908
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,080
there's going to be this third state

909
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
which is independent of the first two

910
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,399
states or dimensions and this means that

911
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,080
the third state has no blanket states

912
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
and therefore is not is no there's no

913
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
particular partition of interest

914
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,200
so

915
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,039
one question for anyone who maybe

916
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,519
understands the formalism just why does

917
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,840
this claim specifically

918
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,158
matter

919
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
so section two

920
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,640
the aim of this section is to get from

921
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,039
the specification of any of a random

922
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,600
dynamical systems in terms of its

923
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
equations of motion to the probability

924
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
density over its states in the long term

925
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,480
future from any initial conditions

926
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
we are only interested in systems that

927
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,000
have a limit set

928
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,360
in other words

929
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,159
systems that possess an attractor

930
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,080
we want to describe systems that do not

931
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
necessarily visit all possible states

932
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,120
are not necessarily time reversible

933
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
are stochastic in nature

934
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,280
and potentially chaotic

935
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
in short we are interested in stochastic

936
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,359
chaos in systems with a pullback

937
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
attractor and then there's several

938
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,119
citations

939
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,359
from the 90s and

940
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,199
maybe that's some of the earlier models

941
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,280
of it

942
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
that's

943
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,359
how they describe it and then they

944
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,639
show this formalism where the lang vine

945
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,800
the change in the state of x

946
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
that's kind of like a derivative

947
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,839
uh sign sometimes

948
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,879
is equivalent to like a flow and then

949
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,719
these faster fluctuations so kind of

950
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,960
like a wave and a ripple but that's

951
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,839
going to describe

952
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,520
the change overall of some location

953
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
and then that is

954
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,560
equivoc equivalated to

955
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,920
the focker plank density dynamics so

956
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,240
they're the same thing that's the equal

957
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
sign

958
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,599
so that

959
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,000
i can't say whether this is just a total

960
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,480
tautology super obvious or whether this

961
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
is a

962
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,839
conclusion that was only more recently

963
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,240
understood that would be helpful to no

964
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,760
but that's one of the baseline

965
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,320
equivalences in the paper is going to be

966
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
you can have

967
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
a specification of a random dynamical

968
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,760
system like here's the set of equations

969
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,240
that describe how this sensor is

970
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
returning data

971
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
and then

972
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,359
turn it into

973
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,119
a flow

974
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,599
and a density

975
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,640
estimation framework

976
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,000
so the plank

977
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,240
they write the dot product the dot

978
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
notation

979
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
indicates a partial temporal derivative

980
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,320
in the absence of random fluctuations

981
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
i.e gamma equals zero

982
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,440
the attractor corresponds to a limit set

983
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
namely the set of states onto which the

984
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,800
solutions of one converge so

985
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
uh there's kind of like

986
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,480
uh

987
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,720
some steady state

988
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,160
attractor

989
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,040
which

990
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
is when there's a heat differential like

991
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
there's a it's warmer outside it's

992
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,280
cooler inside and then

993
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,400
there's some

994
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
point where the thing

995
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,960
gets a zero

996
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
when the flow shows

997
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
exponential divergence of trajectories

998
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,599
with positively open of exponents i.e

999
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,200
real positive eigenvalues in the

1000
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
jacobian of the flow the system can be

1001
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
said to be chaotic

1002
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
so they're systems that kind of converge

1003
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,640
nicely when they're pulled away a little

1004
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,720
bit so let's just say that it stayed the

1005
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
same temperature inside and outside in

1006
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
that previous example then that

1007
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,680
equilibrium would be like pretty nice

1008
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
because it would return to it if it

1009
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,440
slightly

1010
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
were moved away from it but there's also

1011
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,720
systems

1012
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,880
where nearby points

1013
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,920
diverge and that's a measure of

1014
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,119
this

1015
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,640
approximated by this leopardive exponent

1016
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
and then the question is for systems

1017
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,560
that do have positive

1018
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
leading leopardive

1019
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,640
vectors

1020
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,839
then

1021
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,560
what happens to those

1022
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
flow

1023
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
models

1024
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,839
and then what happens when

1025
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,800
there's

1026
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
a um

1027
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
reinstating of the random fluctuations

1028
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,480
how does that sort of system that would

1029
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,240
be chaotic if it were allowed to just

1030
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
somehow deterministically evolve

1031
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
so it's like you're fitting the

1032
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,839
underlying model and it's a little noisy

1033
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,880
around it and then you swap out the

1034
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
actual scattering of the real world

1035
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,640
populations of deer and rabbit for just

1036
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,839
the partial

1037
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,800
derivatives that you were estimating

1038
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
and then maybe you see that there's some

1039
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,640
bifurcation in the population density

1040
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,400
but of course any real population is

1041
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,160
either going to experience one branch or

1042
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
the other of that bifurcation

1043
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,720
so

1044
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
that's kind of the modeling that they're

1045
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,079
working on

1046
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
and then when you go from that dynamical

1047
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,680
systems approximation to the flow

1048
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
if the flow shows exponential divergence

1049
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
of trajectories we can impute stochastic

1050
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,760
chaos

1051
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,079
so they take one of the classic systems

1052
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,359
of deterministic chaos

1053
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,160
uh

1054
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,880
and dynamical chaos the lorenz system

1055
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,480
which is kind of a butterfly looking

1056
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
attractor

1057
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,200
and they

1058
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,119
um

1059
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
uh first

1060
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
show the trajectory of lorenz attractor

1061
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
with and without this reinstating of

1062
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
random fluctuations

1063
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,280
so we know that there's a

1064
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
divergence

1065
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
lyopniv divergence that's

1066
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
making the system chaotic

1067
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
when there's no random

1068
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
fluctuations so what happens when that

1069
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,440
is reintroduced

1070
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
the middle panels

1071
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,440
show the corresponding solutions in the

1072
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,520
three-dimensional state space

1073
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
illustrating the butterfly shape of the

1074
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,640
limit set

1075
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
so

1076
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,079
even when the um

1077
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,440
and the random attractor so the

1078
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,359
deterministic one is the kind of clean

1079
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,560
butterfly

1080
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,320
and then the um

1081
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,560
uh one with a random fluctuation

1082
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,359
the points are outside of

1083
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,280
the butterfly it's a slightly different

1084
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
shape

1085
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,520
but then it it still illustrates it's

1086
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,040
not a uh

1087
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,560
you know

1088
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
an x

1089
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
in the state space so it still

1090
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,960
is kind of following this but just

1091
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,800
it's of course it's not

1092
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,040
following the exact tracks that it's on

1093
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
because there's a random fluctuation

1094
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,640
term but it still is going to have a

1095
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,520
certain

1096
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
geometry

1097
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
because this is a model hence

1098
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
information geometry

1099
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
so

1100
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
that's going to get some transformations

1101
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,359
and approximations

1102
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,520
lower left panel plots the fluctuations

1103
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
in the potential evaluated using the

1104
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
laplacian form this is kind of formalism

1105
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
that's going to come later but expresses

1106
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,920
the self-information

1107
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,760
as an analytic

1108
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,599
function of the states

1109
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,880
and then

1110
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
the states

1111
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,560
i was not exactly sure why they were

1112
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,960
called states rather than dimensions so

1113
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560
if anyone has a thought on that that'd

1114
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
be interesting and then the lower right

1115
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,079
is the potential function of the first

1116
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,319
two states basically or dimensions

1117
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,480
is shown as an image with the trajectory

1118
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,160
superimposed

1119
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,319
so this is kind of the um

1120
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,960
eve this smoothly varying global

1121
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
potential

1122
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,280
plot

1123
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,480
with the

1124
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,760
lighter and the darker representing

1125
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,599
different values there's this like

1126
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,480
dynamical butterfly

1127
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,079
that's

1128
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,800
fit from the re-sampling

1129
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,160
of the true lorenz

1130
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
all right so the key insight from figure

1131
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,079
1 is that the underlying system this is

1132
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,920
kind of a key complexity

1133
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,000
insight that the underlying system can

1134
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,119
have very simple and defined rules yet

1135
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
unpredictable dynamics

1136
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,599
so in the case of dynamical equations

1137
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,760
it's systems like the lorenz attractor

1138
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,119
and many other

1139
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,640
systems that are just very simple and

1140
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,160
they only have a few parts yet they

1141
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
result in these very incredible

1142
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,280
and

1143
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,160
rich

1144
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,119
behavior

1145
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,319
and then there's also kind of like

1146
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,800
simple rules complex outcomes you know

1147
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,920
ants and humans so just a simple rule

1148
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
can be underlying something that's

1149
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
giving

1150
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,319
an extraordinarily complex pattern

1151
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,760
and

1152
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,440
yet if we measure these systems

1153
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,280
empirically

1154
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
that um have some simple rules

1155
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,200
underlying them but there's also this

1156
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
random fluctuation or we don't sample at

1157
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
all

1158
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
there will be some but not overwhelming

1159
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,720
noise there will still be dynamical

1160
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
patterns to pull out

1161
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,359
so

1162
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,280
we can still reduce our uncertainty

1163
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,440
about the location of future points by

1164
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,960
using a statistical model that we

1165
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,319
defined that doesn't even have to be

1166
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,839
similar to the generative process

1167
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,079
so if someone said well you get money

1168
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,280
for getting

1169
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,119
predictions closer to the actual

1170
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
position of the sampling

1171
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,040
even if your model that you're fitting

1172
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
to it is like a neural network or is

1173
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,560
this kind of model that we're going to

1174
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,880
discuss here rather than a differential

1175
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
equation that's actually the true

1176
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
generative model

1177
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,960
you can still

1178
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
do better than just guessing within this

1179
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
cube

1180
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,720
so section 3 goes to the helmholtz

1181
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,160
decomposition

1182
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,280
and they write um

1183
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
so that was the previous section was we

1184
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
can regard the deterministic lorenz

1185
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
system as describing the expected flow

1186
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,720
of a random dynamical system that is

1187
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,800
subject to random fluctuation that was

1188
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,040
what we just talked about the flow of

1189
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,640
such systems which possess a

1190
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
non-equilibrium steady state density can

1191
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,800
be expressed using a generalization of

1192
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,599
the helmholtz decomposition into

1193
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,560
dissipative which is irrotational and

1194
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
curl free and conservative which is

1195
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
rotational divergence-free components

1196
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,960
where the latter are referred to as

1197
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
solenoidal flow

1198
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,440
for an introduction to the

1199
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
generalization of this helmholtz

1200
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,839
decomposition see appendix b of 16 which

1201
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,200
is

1202
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,960
bayesian mechanics stream number 26.

1203
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,160
so

1204
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,240
we're looking for where p

1205
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,880
dot so the partials

1206
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,319
of p partial derivatives of p are zero

1207
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,240
so where is

1208
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,119
that

1209
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,000
flow equilibrium

1210
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,800
well

1211
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,400
that is going to

1212
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,560
be a function f

1213
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,920
that has a few

1214
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,240
terms including one that's

1215
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,000
i think introduced in this paper the

1216
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
housekeeping function

1217
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,640
but it has two terms that are the

1218
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,400
classic helmholtz decomposition which is

1219
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
the solenoidal the tangential current

1220
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,280
that's just the spire the iso contour

1221
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,720
and the gradient which is kind of like

1222
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,079
the up and down

1223
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,760
so that's how a total current in

1224
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,000
electromagnetics gets decomposed and

1225
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,040
it's related to um kind of fundamental

1226
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,000
vector field math

1227
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,160
so

1228
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,359
let's go and uncover what was hidden by

1229
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,720
this gray box

1230
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
so we have the the focker plank steady

1231
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,000
state p of x equals zero p dot of x is

1232
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,200
zero

1233
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,640
there's some function that's going to be

1234
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,440
a decomposition of that into

1235
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,839
a solenoidal and a gradient flow

1236
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,359
component the helmholtz decomposition

1237
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,240
and then

1238
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,800
this housekeeping term

1239
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
which is an append in appendix but um

1240
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,839
didn't go into in super depth

1241
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,839
so curious about what that is but it

1242
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,839
results in this whole flow term

1243
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,720
here is the fancy eye

1244
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,800
maybe it's a fancy j the first

1245
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,960
dissipative part performs a romanian

1246
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
gram gradient descent on the negative

1247
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
logarithm of the steady state density

1248
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,079
which can be interpreted as the

1249
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,400
self-information

1250
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,520
which is the

1251
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,640
negative

1252
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,160
natural log of p of any given state

1253
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
or as some potential function

1254
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,480
so that's kind of like how surprising is

1255
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
that state the second part of the flow

1256
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,160
is the solenoidal circulation on the

1257
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,280
isocontours of the steady-state density

1258
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,720
and then the third term is this

1259
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
housekeeping term that accounts for how

1260
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,720
changes in the flow operator

1261
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,959
change

1262
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,520
so it's a um

1263
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,560
extension of the helmholtz decomposition

1264
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,480
thinking about how to solve dynamical

1265
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,680
equations

1266
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,160
so this is from active26 the

1267
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
synchronization map and

1268
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,680
i'm not going to go into the whole thing

1269
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,480
because you can check out 26 but the key

1270
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
question is about this sigma this

1271
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,400
synchronization manifold

1272
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,640
between the internal the external states

1273
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,200
conditioned on the blanket states

1274
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,079
so

1275
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,800
how do you insulate yet have

1276
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,119
anticipation across that installation

1277
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,079
and then also from 26 this is kind of

1278
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,359
what it looks like to see a stochastic

1279
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,720
trajectory

1280
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,440
decomposed into a gradient

1281
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,560
and a rotational component

1282
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,040
all right 3.1 our objective is to

1283
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
identify the functional forms form of

1284
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,720
the self-information or potential

1285
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
function that describes the

1286
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,119
non-equilibrium steady-state density

1287
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,839
so why

1288
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,760
that's

1289
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,680
how surprised you should be

1290
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,760
that's the potential function

1291
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,420
that's sort of the um

1292
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,499
[Music]

1293
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,520
the fund the fundamental frequency of

1294
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,920
both the solenoidal and the gradient

1295
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,000
so it's an important variable to know

1296
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
but how is self-information measured or

1297
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,280
calculated

1298
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,040
how does the self-information for

1299
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,800
different non-equilibrium steady-state

1300
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,520
or equilibrium study states compare

1301
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,200
what does it mean for self-information

1302
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,440
to be high or low

1303
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
so to be surprised or not

1304
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,200
so first

1305
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,560
they um in formalism 4 address this set

1306
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,880
of questions basically for one

1307
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,160
simple er case which i'm not super

1308
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,560
familiar with the matrix

1309
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
math so we'll leave it to others to

1310
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,599
evaluate some of the technical details

1311
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,800
so then they

1312
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,160
follow up and say basically

1313
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,800
we could solve that easily without that

1314
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,240
correction term

1315
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,640
that arises when flow operators are a

1316
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,960
function of the states indeed it is this

1317
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,400
state dependency that underwrites

1318
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,720
stochastic chaos so that's like the

1319
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,800
double pendulum

1320
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,520
the reason why it's a chaotic system is

1321
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,319
because the states at the time depend on

1322
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,800
the previous time

1323
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,680
in a way that generates chaos

1324
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,839
so there's so much dependence over short

1325
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,079
term that things can diverge really fast

1326
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,920
this present this presents us with a

1327
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,839
more difficult problem the problem can

1328
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,359
be finessed by using polynomial

1329
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,040
expansions of the flow operator and the

1330
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,440
potential as follows for n states up to

1331
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,680
polynomial order m so they're going to

1332
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,920
use polynomial expansion approximation

1333
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,680
on a complex underlying flow functional

1334
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,599
polynomial expansions

1335
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,200
restrict and scaffold our model

1336
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,960
selection approach to a manageable size

1337
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,119
and tractable computation so it's kind

1338
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,480
of like the taylor series and the

1339
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,440
volterra series and other

1340
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,520
polynomial expansions

1341
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,119
which can fit

1342
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,520
functions often that are very complex

1343
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,400
well

1344
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,280
and so this is showing um the

1345
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
taylor approximation to

1346
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,280
a um sine wave

1347
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,960
and showing how the first approximation

1348
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,800
gets you like between

1349
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,760
1 and negative 1 the red line might be

1350
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,000
totally more than enough but with only a

1351
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,359
few more terms being added all of a

1352
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
sudden it starts fitting really well

1353
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,720
further and further out so that doesn't

1354
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,599
mean it can go forever but the um

1355
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,119
polynomial expansions can be very

1356
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,400
powerful

1357
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,760
in the

1358
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,920
numerical case like just doing good

1359
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,319
enough with quick and dirty as well as

1360
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,280
in the analytical case

1361
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,720
here's a figure from spm 2007 textbook

1362
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
which is a great textbook by the way

1363
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,119
and it's talking about the volterra

1364
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,960
series as a general

1365
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,800
non-linear input state output

1366
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,280
characterization system so

1367
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,720
nb no to bene good note to you

1368
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,480
volterra kernels are synonymous with

1369
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,839
effective connectivity

1370
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,920
and then they write

1371
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,079
this is from the spm

1372
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,480
12 so later than this but right up from

1373
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,559
the point of view of regression models

1374
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,720
modulatory effects can be modeled with

1375
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,559
nonlinear input output models and in

1376
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,559
particular the volterra formulation

1377
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,880
described above

1378
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,559
because the kernels are high order they

1379
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,640
embody interactions over time and among

1380
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,880
inputs and can be thought of as explicit

1381
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,280
measures of effective connectivity

1382
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
an important thing about the volterra

1383
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,400
formulation is that it has a high face

1384
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,040
validity and biological plausibility

1385
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,200
the only thing it assumes

1386
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,119
is that the response of a region is some

1387
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,880
analytic non-linear function of the

1388
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,680
inputs over the recent past

1389
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,440
this function exists even for many

1390
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
complicated dynamical systems with many

1391
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,839
unobservable state variables

1392
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:18,880
so

1393
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,200
cool

1394
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,599
why does it matter to do a polynomial

1395
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,520
expansion of the functional form of the

1396
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,000
solution to this flow problem

1397
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,839
the parameterization in 5 allows for

1398
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,599
state dependent changes in the amplitude

1399
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,520
of random fluctuations

1400
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,359
encoded by the leading diagonal of the

1401
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,119
flow operator

1402
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,400
with that functional form of the

1403
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,480
polynomial it is straightforward to

1404
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
solve for polynomial coefficients the

1405
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,800
flow operator by solving the following

1406
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
simultaneous equations for a series of

1407
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,919
sample points

1408
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,520
some of the keywords that are

1409
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,720
from spm and elsewhere that might come

1410
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,319
into play to learn more about these

1411
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,960
topics are expectation maximization

1412
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,240
optimization

1413
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
parametric empirical base

1414
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,160
dynamical systems identification and

1415
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
generalized linearization schemes for

1416
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,200
fitting

1417
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,040
glms to

1418
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,960
non-linear systems

1419
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,359
and then something that's not as much in

1420
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,400
spm

1421
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,160
but comes into play later with active

1422
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,000
inference and hopefully we'll be able to

1423
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,559
demonstrate this in the literature as we

1424
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,319
sort of sift through it

1425
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,480
is that action planning

1426
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,319
amidst uncertainty and feedback with the

1427
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,599
environment

1428
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,760
radically changes the nature of that

1429
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,079
kind of flow estimation problem

1430
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,119
you can't

1431
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,839
um use the same model necessarily for

1432
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:38,720
the

1433
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,319
um

1434
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,880
leaf on the stream as something like the

1435
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,559
winged snowflake that's actively

1436
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,160
resisting

1437
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,880
so

1438
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,520
how good is this approximation

1439
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,079
to use the polynomial expansion

1440
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,559
of the fitting of the random

1441
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,720
fluctuations of the random dynamical

1442
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,960
system that is chaotic

1443
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,200
inspection of the lorenz system suggests

1444
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,119
that a second order polynomial

1445
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,960
approximation is sufficient given the

1446
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,440
flow of second order in the states

1447
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,079
this unsoughts so

1448
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,520
vocab

1449
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,119
onsots

1450
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,800
an assumption about the form of an

1451
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,640
unknown function which is made in order

1452
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
to facilitate solution of an equation or

1453
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,279
other problem

1454
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,720
has an interesting implication if the

1455
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,319
self-information can be approximated

1456
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,400
with a second order polynomial it means

1457
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,079
the non-equilibrium steady state is

1458
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,480
approximately gaussian this is known as

1459
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,520
the laplace approximation in statistics

1460
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,920
here we generalize the notion of a

1461
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,079
laplace approximation to cover not just

1462
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,240
the quadratic form of the log density

1463
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,920
but also the solenoidal flow that

1464
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,119
underwrites non-equilibrium dynamics

1465
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,559
big if true

1466
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,960
it has to be

1467
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,760
so

1468
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,800
here's the helmholtz decomposition

1469
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
so now we're taking

1470
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,319
that

1471
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,839
solution that we had earlier

1472
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,160
uh and thinking about it in terms of

1473
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,000
fitting only up to the second order

1474
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,760
polynomial expansion of the flow

1475
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,480
solution so that is as they say what is

1476
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,800
known as the laplace approximation in

1477
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
statistics and it's in spm textbook 2.

1478
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,880
here's the actual flow decomposition of

1479
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,839
the lorenz system

1480
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,240
the solenoidal flow is red the gradient

1481
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,000
flows blue and the correction term is

1482
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,960
gold

1483
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,720
the flow is shown as a quiver plot at

1484
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,119
equally spaced points so it's kind of

1485
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,440
like the vectors of different

1486
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,000
direction at different points and then

1487
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,520
the right is the same but for the

1488
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,200
laplacian based upon the one on the left

1489
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,400
here

1490
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,440
the key difference is that the

1491
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,200
dissipative part of the flow operator

1492
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,839
and hessian are positive definite

1493
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,839
indicates the laplacian which means the

1494
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,760
gradient flows converge to the max

1495
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,599
maximum of the non-equilibrium steady

1496
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,079
state density this is reflected in the

1497
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,520
blue arrows that point to the center of

1498
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,760
the space

1499
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,079
so even though the gradient of the real

1500
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,160
flow is pointing

1501
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,359
all the different directions because

1502
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,040
it's kind of like a mixing flow so

1503
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,640
there's all the vectors are going in

1504
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,000
different directions

1505
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,920
but then in the laplacian

1506
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,400
second order polynomial expansion

1507
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
the blue arrows are all pointing to the

1508
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,440
center

1509
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,319
or to some manifold that's much more

1510
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,240
compact so it's kind of like a

1511
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,160
converging solution even though the

1512
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,599
actual system

1513
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,359
we defined it to have

1514
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,960
stochastic chaotic properties so

1515
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,319
here's spm

1516
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,559
looking at the lorenz tractor

1517
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,960
alas poor lorenz

1518
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,640
i knew it horatio

1519
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,960
a model of infinite citations of most

1520
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,200
excellent fancy it hath returned to the

1521
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,680
pullback attractor a thousand times

1522
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,160
and now how abort in my imagination it

1523
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,119
is

1524
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,640
so that's

1525
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,839
modified

1526
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,280
from hamlet

1527
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,920
because right after that seemingly very

1528
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,880
cool

1529
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,920
solution

1530
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,359
they say

1531
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,839
indeed the equations of motions

1532
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,599
we have written down are deterministic

1533
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,599
implying that there is no stochasticity

1534
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,960
in the sample paths of the process

1535
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,000
assuming a fixed initial condition this

1536
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,440
speaks to the fact that helmholtz

1537
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,040
decomposition of the deterministic

1538
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,880
lorenz system is not a description of a

1539
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,240
dynamical system with random

1540
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,079
fluctuations ie systems in which the

1541
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,839
dissipative part of a flow operator is

1542
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,280
positive definite

1543
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,640
we therefore need to look beyond the

1544
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,960
lorenz attractor so that takes us to

1545
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,160
appropriately 3.3 for beyond the lorenz

1546
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,799
system so okay cool

1547
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,680
now beyond lorenz system we go

1548
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,520
to the chaotic laplacian so figure three

1549
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,000
this is um a trajectory kind of like a

1550
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,240
pointless trajectory of three states

1551
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,640
kind of three dimensions comprising a

1552
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,520
laplacian approximation

1553
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,680
to a stochastic lorentz system so here

1554
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,280
it's second by third

1555
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,079
first by third first by second of the

1556
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,920
nest density so it's showing three

1557
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,960
projections like the geb cover

1558
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,119
onto a two dimensional and notice how

1559
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,880
the light is in the center so it's like

1560
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,799
they're getting pulled back

1561
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,720
to the peak of the gaussian

1562
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,839
on each dimension

1563
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,240
so that's the non-equilibrium steady

1564
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,680
state which by construction in the

1565
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,920
laplacian is a multivariate gaussian

1566
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,319
that's super key and extremely

1567
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,599
interesting

1568
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,160
the middle panels show deterministic and

1569
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,920
stochastic solutions as a function of

1570
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,200
time

1571
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,400
while the right panel plots the same

1572
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,240
trajectories in the state space the

1573
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,440
shape of the attractor retains a

1574
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,960
butterfly-like form but is clearly

1575
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,880
different from the lorenz attractor so

1576
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,319
what do you see when you look at this

1577
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,440
attractor

1578
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,799
be honest

1579
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,040
but it has a butterfly-like shape and

1580
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,160
the um

1581
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,799
generated trajectory has some

1582
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,799
uh similarity with

1583
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,079
the

1584
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,079
underlying generator function but it has

1585
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,640
a such a nicer form to solve

1586
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,319
and then the lower left is the self

1587
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,160
information the potential as a function

1588
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,079
of time based upon the analytic form for

1589
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,680
the equations of motion

1590
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,760
and the deterministic trajectories of

1591
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,680
the previous panel

1592
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,119
and then

1593
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,440
the flow of the laplacian which is the

1594
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,599
approximated

1595
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,599
expansion

1596
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,520
nicely solvable etc

1597
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,200
against the lorenz

1598
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,079
that's the true flow is evaluated at 64

1599
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,160
space points it can be seen that

1600
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,520
although there is a high correlation

1601
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,280
between the flow of the laplacian loren

1602
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,680
systems they are not identical so not

1603
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,280
super visible could have provided like

1604
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,200
an r squared or some other information

1605
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,920
but clearly they are um drawing from the

1606
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,520
same manifold

1607
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,319
so

1608
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,799
if this is good enough to stay alive

1609
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,079
then

1610
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,720
c'est la vie

1611
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,720
upper panels just focus on those so

1612
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,119
this is again the projection onto two by

1613
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,240
three one by three and one by two

1614
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,760
of three

1615
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,240
of this multivariate gaussian

1616
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,000
laplacian approximation which makes it

1617
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,160
really nicely solvable so one can then

1618
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,599
estimate the lyapunov dimension

1619
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,680
which is approximating to the house door

1620
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,480
hausdorff dimension

1621
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,599
which in this example was 2.48

1622
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,400
so

1623
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,960
the laplacian approximation

1624
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
was used to sample

1625
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,079
and then estimate the lyopniv dimension

1626
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,400
and then it turns out that

1627
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,319
that compares very closely 2.43 and 2.48

1628
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,760
which in the grand scale of things where

1629
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,160
above one means chaotic system

1630
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,119
it means that the laplacian

1631
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,200
expansion has some of the nicely

1632
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,720
solvable characteristics of the

1633
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,880
generalized laplacian like the

1634
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,200
multivariate gaussian and the easy

1635
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,720
computation

1636
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,040
yet it also identifies the system as

1637
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,400
chaotic

1638
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
because it's it still gives a positively

1639
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,280
open exponent

1640
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,680
from this sampling

1641
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,440
in short the flows of the loren system

1642
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,119
and its laplace approximation have an

1643
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,480
attracting set with between two and

1644
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,319
three dimensions for our purposes the

1645
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,160
laplace approximation is easier to

1646
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,640
handle than the lorenz system

1647
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,559
because the functional forms the flow

1648
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,280
and potential are immediately at hand

1649
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,960
so

1650
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,359
pretty interesting

1651
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,480
figure four

1652
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,160
so now

1653
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,000
this recalls our earlier discussion of

1654
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,480
the jacobian and the hessian

1655
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,200
so

1656
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,319
let us recall the jacobian is the first

1657
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,799
order partial derivatives

1658
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,440
the hessian is the second order partial

1659
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,119
derivatives

1660
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,119
okay

1661
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,240
so

1662
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,720
we have the jacobian

1663
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,559
the hessian and the covariance

1664
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,520
between these three dimensions

1665
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,240
so

1666
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,480
the lorenz attractor was in three

1667
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,799
dimensions okay it was in state one two

1668
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,559
and three that's kind of why there's

1669
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,640
it's like thermodynamic states so there

1670
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,480
are dimensions though so

1671
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,319
the lens attractor was this like kind of

1672
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,160
you know ant flying around in space in

1673
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,599
three dimensions

1674
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,799
so we fit a polynomial expansion

1675
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,720
specifically to those three dimensions

1676
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,880
the measurements of them

1677
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,599
now for those three dimensions

1678
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,680
we can talk about

1679
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,079
their correlations

1680
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,760
in the first partial derivative

1681
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,079
and the second partial derivative and

1682
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,599
the covariance

1683
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,559
that's in the

1684
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,880
top here

1685
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,400
in this example the third state is

1686
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,319
independent of the first pair

1687
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,480
where the independence

1688
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,000
rests on the directed coupling from the

1689
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,480
third to the first state

1690
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,040
and so it's logged to show the sparsity

1691
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,720
so

1692
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,920
do you see where we're going with the

1693
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,280
markov blanket

1694
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,920
see how this third state

1695
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,520
it's not part of the lorenz system

1696
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
underlying differential equations

1697
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,680
it's actually just a total figurement of

1698
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,960
the laplace approximation model

1699
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,720
but it's quite an interesting pattern

1700
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,799
the middle panel

1701
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,720
shows slices through the steady state

1702
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,799
density over the two states

1703
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:13,000
um

1704
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,160
[Music]

1705
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,839
at increasing values of the remaining

1706
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,880
state

1707
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,559
so the only correlation in play is

1708
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,240
between the first and second state so

1709
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,839
this is related to

1710
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,599
sphericity error correction and

1711
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,040
evaluation

1712
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,200
and it's a topic that is discussed in

1713
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,240
spm textbook

1714
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,040
but basically spherical errors are the

1715
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,760
ones where the two axes are not

1716
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,040
correlated but then when there's

1717
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,680
non-spherical errors then there's

1718
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,760
you get a different shape

1719
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,240
the lower panel the correlation

1720
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,760
is illustrated in terms of the

1721
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,520
conditional density over the first state

1722
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,799
given the second

1723
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,119
so this is kind of showing that

1724
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,640
by and large

1725
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,400
it's

1726
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,280
doing well

1727
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,760
largely confined to the 90 credible

1728
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,520
intervals would be good to see some you

1729
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,559
know

1730
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,480
simulation statistics and raw data on

1731
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,599
that

1732
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,720
so

1733
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,400
again alas

1734
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,680
i knew him well

1735
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,359
the preceding treatment leverages the

1736
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,520
simplicity of the laplace approximation

1737
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,920
to stochastic chaos in which sparsity

1738
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,240
constraints on the hessian are easy to

1739
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,880
identify or implement

1740
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,760
now

1741
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,960
just like lorenz was dropped

1742
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,960
now this is going to be

1743
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,000
going beyond the laplace

1744
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,119
system

1745
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,640
so

1746
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,480
i'm going to go into too much detail

1747
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,559
here but that's

1748
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,839
that's a section that people could

1749
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,079
explain more about or we could look at

1750
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,559
more in the dot one the dot two so three

1751
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,119
point five summary

1752
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,720
it is important to not conflate the

1753
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,960
simplicity of a ness density with the

1754
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,720
complexity of the underlying density

1755
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,559
dynamics

1756
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,319
in other words when prepared or observed

1757
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,920
in some initial state the probability

1758
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
density can evolve in a complicated and

1759
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,520
itinerant fashion on various sub

1760
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,880
manifolds of the pullback attractor so

1761
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,039
the map is not the territory that's

1762
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,680
something that has come up many times

1763
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,640
the laplacian is not the lorenz

1764
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,599
but

1765
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,559
the laplacian is a good approximation to

1766
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,240
the lorenz

1767
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,119
in their simulations

1768
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,559
figure six

1769
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,359
so

1770
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,160
now

1771
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,839
the chaotic laplacian system

1772
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,920
is um

1773
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,200
it's kind of shown in a time series way

1774
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,920
where this is the true

1775
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,280
relationship

1776
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,440
between um the first and the second

1777
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,359
state so let's go to here so we see the

1778
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:40,880
first and the second state

1779
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,000
here's like where there's this

1780
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,480
non-spherical error

1781
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,000
and so this is kind of like an

1782
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,160
interesting like coupling in the model

1783
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,680
that's independent of the random

1784
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,359
fluctuations

1785
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,240
and so that represents something very

1786
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,720
deep about the structure of

1787
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,559
the laplacian approximation to the

1788
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,400
lorentz

1789
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,280
now

1790
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,520
using the laplacian in a generative

1791
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,920
capacity

1792
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,839
there's this initial misattunement in

1793
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:14,319
their setup it starts somewhere far from

1794
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,000
the pullback attractor

1795
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,240
and then like the correlation evolves

1796
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,880
through time and then they say

1797
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,640
the density converges to the steady

1798
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,799
state density after about 16 seconds

1799
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,480
however it takes a rather circuitous

1800
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,920
route from this particular set of states

1801
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,799
okay

1802
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,960
so that's interesting it starts with

1803
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,599
like they were differently correlated

1804
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,119
because of they starting in a weird

1805
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,559
place and then they found their true

1806
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,559
correlation structure note that the

1807
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,079
average density over short periods of

1808
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,280
time can be highly non-gaussian

1809
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,200
even though the density at any point is

1810
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,879
by construction gaussian

1811
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,520
something to think about

1812
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,520
so then we get to finally markov

1813
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,839
blankets

1814
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,000
so they repeat the analysis but now they

1815
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,880
approximate two lorenz systems that are

1816
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,160
coupled to each other through their

1817
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,119
respective first states so the first and

1818
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,200
the second states were coupled

1819
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,960
so it's almost like one of our coupled

1820
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,559
states we're gonna

1821
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,920
couple out now

1822
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,160
this induces a richer conditional

1823
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,160
independent structure from which one can

1824
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,000
identify internal and external states

1825
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,359
that are independent when conditioned

1826
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,440
upon blanket states so

1827
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,880
what does it mean to sparsely couple

1828
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,799
systems

1829
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,480
and what are these quote first states

1830
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,559
the first dimension okay figure seven so

1831
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,000
now there's generalized synchrony in a

1832
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,680
laplacian system

1833
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,880
so this is now the same figure as figure

1834
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,200
3 like this

1835
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,839
except now we're looking at

1836
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,839
the generalized synchrony

1837
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,200
so now there's a synchronization

1838
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,240
manifold in

1839
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,319
the first

1840
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,799
state when those two got linked up so

1841
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,319
now there's more lines because there's

1842
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,520
like two coupled chaotic systems

1843
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,839
but the middle is showing that their

1844
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,520
state spaces are

1845
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,799
coupled

1846
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,559
and this is illustrating the degree of

1847
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:09,839
synchronization

1848
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,319
and then again showing that their flows

1849
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,440
are correlated no stats

1850
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,720
figure eight

1851
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,200
now instead of having

1852
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,240
3

1853
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,119
by 3 in the matrix correlation and

1854
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,880
covariance in the first and the second

1855
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,200
derivatives now it's

1856
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,960
6 by 6.

1857
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,400
so here is now the identification of

1858
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,520
using the log of the jacobian

1859
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,079
and the hessian to identify

1860
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,000
different partitions

1861
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,240
so that partitioning between the one and

1862
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,680
the four

1863
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,880
between that first state of both

1864
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,480
is the one that we knew about that's

1865
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,480
like

1866
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,400
the the one that was wired into the

1867
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,920
system

1868
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,200
but then the other ones are showing

1869
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,799
other correlation patterns now for i

1870
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,400
don't know why this four and five

1871
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,960
connection is not included in a box but

1872
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,039
these are the partitionings

1873
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,520
and so um

1874
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,720
the sparsity structure of the covariance

1875
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,960
supports a particular partition into

1876
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,839
internal states five and six dark blue

1877
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
active

1878
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,920
fourth state the one that induces

1879
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,640
the one that connects

1880
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,879
here

1881
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,920
sensory first state and external second

1882
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,920
and third state this partition is

1883
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
illustrated here and the remarkable

1884
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,200
thing is that despite their conditional

1885
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,559
independence there are correlations

1886
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,640
between internal and external states and

1887
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,160
here between the second and fifth states

1888
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,760
so

1889
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,599
interesting patterns

1890
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,240
showing these evolving through time

1891
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,520
nine

1892
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,440
so now they're going to look at the

1893
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,319
partial correlation of the states

1894
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,839
um and showing that the hessian

1895
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,119
is

1896
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,799
recovered

1897
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,039
so here is like that

1898
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,599
hessian on the top right

1899
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,480
and then now they're gonna show

1900
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,920
that it's recovered it's a little bit

1901
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,599
light

1902
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,440
but it's showing how

1903
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,520
these so so these squares

1904
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,799
are showing the partial correlation

1905
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,960
coefficients and hopefully pulling out

1906
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,839
the similar structure as identified here

1907
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:26,799
and then um like the strong correlation

1908
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:27,759
well

1909
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,520
yeah we'll investigate that more in the

1910
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,439
dot one the dot two and then showing how

1911
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,439
like the third and the sixth state

1912
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,279
for example so that's like three and six

1913
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,158
they're not supposed to be coupled

1914
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,839
and so then they initially start off

1915
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,198
with a high correlation because maybe

1916
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,799
they start in the same neighborhood but

1917
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,479
then they converge towards a zero

1918
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,719
correlation

1919
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:49,439
so

1920
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,640
that is

1921
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,759
sparse coupling

1922
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,359
it does not depend upon gaussian

1923
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,439
assumptions about the non-equilibrium

1924
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,080
steady state density it implies that the

1925
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,158
dynamical influence graphs with absent

1926
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:03,920
or directed edges admit a mark called

1927
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,238
blanket which may or may not be empty

1928
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,839
these independencies can be used to

1929
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,000
build a particular partition using

1930
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,679
following rules

1931
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,279
capture the flag figure 10.

1932
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,359
so here's where we see kind of the

1933
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,319
classic bacteria example but now it's

1934
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,080
two bacteria communicating i'm not sure

1935
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,158
if it was always that way and then here

1936
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,839
is a little bit more

1937
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,080
of a coupled systems with two times

1938
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,080
three

1939
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,640
which is pretty interesting

1940
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,719
so here is where we see the mark all

1941
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,279
blanket as we've seen it before but also

1942
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,479
in a new way

1943
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,399
how great

1944
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,158
here's some technical definitions of the

1945
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,158
markov blanket so

1946
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,799
not for tonight but

1947
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,759
for another night

1948
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,198
so um

1949
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:52,640
here's a question they asked themselves

1950
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,719
why why one might ask why does a

1951
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,800
particular partition comprise four sets

1952
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,760
of states

1953
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,000
i don't know why is the tetrahedra the

1954
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,560
smallest polyhedra who knows

1955
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,679
in other words

1956
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,840
why does a particular partition consider

1957
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,239
two markov boundaries sensory and active

1958
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,640
states so why can we skip straight to

1959
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,400
the fristen blanket rather than just

1960
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,840
identifying the pearl 1988 or the markov

1961
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,679
earlier model

1962
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,120
the reason is that the particular

1963
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,800
partition is the minimal partition that

1964
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,640
allows for directed coupling with

1965
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,800
blanket states

1966
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,440
so that again is from figure 10

1967
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
and the key thing to note from figure 8

1968
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,360
is that there are profound covariances

1969
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,800
between some internal and external

1970
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,159
states despite the fact they are

1971
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,320
conditionally independent

1972
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,199
so

1973
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,840
we're defining like nodes that are not

1974
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
connected are conditionally independent

1975
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,400
that's how the bayesian graph works

1976
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,760
so here one and four get correlated

1977
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,520
get a connection with each other that's

1978
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,440
this connection right here right there

1979
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,719
and right there

1980
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,640
so now they're coupled

1981
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,120
one and four so even though

1982
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,280
some of the internal states

1983
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,760
are so now it's like

1984
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
the external states are

1985
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,239
at minimum two and bucky fuller

1986
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,840
famous quote unity is plural at minimum

1987
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,600
two the internal states have to be at

1988
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,360
minimum two

1989
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,040
external states have to be at minimum

1990
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,280
two

1991
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,679
so that's pretty interesting

1992
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,880
because they yeah

1993
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,280
um

1994
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,159
yeah

1995
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,760
the particular partition is the minimal

1996
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,199
partition that allows for directed

1997
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,199
coupling with blanket states

1998
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,080
okay

1999
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,600
and then um

2000
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,120
they're the second the fifth states are

2001
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,440
highly correlated yet are

2002
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,760
twice removed

2003
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,920
and so this is leading to a general

2004
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,120
synchrony through partial coupling

2005
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,320
of

2006
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,040
dynamical systems

2007
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,120
note this is their words note there is

2008
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,360
no claim that either the original lorenz

2009
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,120
system or coupled lorenz system

2010
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,679
possesses a markov blanket

2011
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,000
the claim here is that there exists a

2012
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,080
laplace approximation to these kinds of

2013
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,000
systems that in virtue of the zero

2014
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,600
elements of the hessian

2015
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,719
feature markov blankets so

2016
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,719
oh how many days

2017
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,000
the having a markov being a markov

2018
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,120
modeling a markov

2019
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,760
no claim

2020
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,960
a laplace approximation

2021
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,360
approach to systems identification can

2022
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,960
add constraints and make the problem

2023
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,480
easier to solve

2024
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,880
the markov blanket is arising

2025
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,400
literally within the laplace

2026
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,000
approximation

2027
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,760
which is just an approximation it's not

2028
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,840
a description of the system

2029
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,080
so

2030
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,000
on to the free energy principle

2031
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,600
the existence of this any particular

2032
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,679
partition means that one can provide a

2033
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:52,960
stipulative definition of the

2034
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,040
conditional density over external states

2035
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,719
being parameterized by the conditional

2036
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,640
expectation of internal states given

2037
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,920
sensory states

2038
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,080
we call this a variational density

2039
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,840
parameterized by expected internal

2040
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,320
states mu

2041
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,040
so

2042
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,400
going from

2043
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,679
the minimal coupled systems

2044
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,960
to

2045
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,400
there are still some persistent

2046
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,040
covariances

2047
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,920
and these covariances

2048
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,360
partition out

2049
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,040
into

2050
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,360
a markov blanket

2051
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,120
what if

2052
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,760
the expectation of the internal states

2053
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,960
were of external states

2054
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,040
in other words or in words for every

2055
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,719
sensory state there's a conditional but

2056
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,000
it has to be conditioned on the blanket

2057
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,840
state which is how the whole thing is

2058
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,400
set up in words for every sensory state

2059
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,000
there's a conditional density over

2060
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,600
external states and conditional density

2061
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,080
over internal states where internal and

2062
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,360
external states are conditionally

2063
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,400
independent

2064
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,159
this admits the possibility of a

2065
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,560
diphyomorphic map between the sufficient

2066
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,280
statistics of the respective densities

2067
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,040
the existence of this mapping rests upon

2068
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,560
a continuously differentiable and

2069
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,000
invertible map

2070
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,679
which is linear under a laplace

2071
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,600
approximation so diffiomorphic is like

2072
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,679
stretchable

2073
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,159
so that allows

2074
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,640
some of these formalisms to arise

2075
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,719
again would be awesome to hear what

2076
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,000
other people

2077
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,760
can bring to the table about this but

2078
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,679
this is like the energy minus entropy

2079
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,400
form the divergence term plus the

2080
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,480
self-information about the policy and

2081
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,320
then the accuracy minus the complexity

2082
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,000
so would be awesome to learn more about

2083
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,760
this

2084
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,360
okay the font got a little out of

2085
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,920
control here but

2086
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,000
this functional

2087
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
the big one

2088
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,440
is going to be expressed in a few

2089
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,880
different forms

2090
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,800
so it's an expected energy minus the

2091
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,840
entropy

2092
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,080
that's energy minus entropy

2093
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,679
self-information

2094
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,560
plus kl divergence okay self-information

2095
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,320
plus kl

2096
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,159
negative log likelihood of particular

2097
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,080
states and the kl diversions accuracy

2098
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,080
minus complexity okay accuracy minus

2099
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,159
complexity

2100
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,600
it's also in the machine learning

2101
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,719
context

2102
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,640
evidence lower bound elbow

2103
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,239
this is the basis of the free energy

2104
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,920
principle

2105
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,760
put simply it means that the expected

2106
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,199
internal states of a particular

2107
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,040
partition at non-equilibrium steady

2108
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,120
state can be cast as encoding

2109
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,199
conditional or bayesian beliefs about

2110
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,840
external states

2111
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,000
equivalently equivalently the flow in

2112
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,440
the internal manifold can be expressed

2113
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,199
as a gradient flow on a

2114
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:28,480
variational free energy

2115
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,679
that can be read as self-information

2116
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,520
this license is a somewhat teleological

2117
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,880
and directed description of

2118
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,440
self-organization as self-evidencing

2119
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,040
in the sense that the surprisal or

2120
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,480
self-information that constitutes the

2121
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,159
potential is known as log model evidence

2122
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,520
or marginal likelihood in bayesian

2123
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,000
statistics so

2124
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,120
wow

2125
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,159
great fep

2126
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,400
work

2127
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,320
what does it mean to talk about the

2128
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,199
physiology perspective here though so

2129
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,960
what does it mean for self-evidencing in

2130
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,800
the biological context the blood vessels

2131
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,159
wanna observe themselves working

2132
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,560
so now in section five one getting

2133
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,880
hopefully towards the end here

2134
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,000
um

2135
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,760
in alternative this is later in section

2136
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,840
five one in alternative and deflationary

2137
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,199
perspective

2138
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,480
rest on noting that free energy

2139
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,760
gradients are also the gradients of

2140
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,760
self-information so the organism wants

2141
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,159
to be minimally surprised about

2142
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,679
some chaotic

2143
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,360
pullback attractor

2144
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,280
so whether or not things are wacky out

2145
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,719
there or not

2146
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,040
having this updating flow

2147
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,480
model

2148
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,120
that comes to a pullback attractor

2149
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,840
that is of the approximation that the

2150
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,400
modeler controls is very important and

2151
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,760
the organism wants to be minimally

2152
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,280
surprised about the expectations and

2153
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,280
preferences that it has over

2154
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,360
observations and that is defined with

2155
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,280
some technical details here

2156
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,239
so

2157
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,760
this formulation of gradient flows is

2158
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,960
simpler and shows that they're

2159
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,640
effectively minimizing a different sort

2160
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,159
of prediction error

2161
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,840
namely the difference between particular

2162
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,440
states and the expected values at

2163
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,960
non-equilibrium steady states

2164
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,880
this leads to exactly the same gradient

2165
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,800
flows but a complementary interpretation

2166
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,320
in which autonomous states are drawn

2167
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,400
towards their steady state expectation

2168
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,840
heuristically one could imagine this

2169
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,600
kind of stochastic chaos as apt to

2170
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,840
describe the motion of a moth attracted

2171
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,159
towards a flame but constantly being

2172
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,400
thwarted by turbulent i.e solenoidal air

2173
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,360
currents

2174
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,280
because active states influence sensory

2175
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,280
states and possibly external states this

2176
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,040
would look as if the particle eg the

2177
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,280
moth was trying to attain its most

2178
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,120
likely state in the face of random

2179
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,159
fluctuations and solenoidal dynamics

2180
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,239
this perspective emphasizes the active

2181
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,400
part of self-evidencing sometimes

2182
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,840
referred to as

2183
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,000
active inference

2184
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
so how cool first in 2006 the winged

2185
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,239
snowflake

2186
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,560
21

2187
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,159
like a moth to the flame

2188
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,199
5.2 so they um

2189
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,000
uh

2190
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,280
give more

2191
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,760
summarization here about that sequence

2192
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,679
that they took of constructing the

2193
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,960
laplacian approximation with a quadratic

2194
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,080
form and then looking at that first and

2195
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,280
second

2196
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,960
partial differential uh partial

2197
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,040
derivatives matrices the jacobian and

2198
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,239
the hessian

2199
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,199
looking at the conditional

2200
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,199
independencies then the generalized

2201
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,440
synchronization synchronizing

2202
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,760
given the um partitionings

2203
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,719
and then

2204
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:29,760
suggesting that there's some

2205
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,199
diphyomorphic like stretchable

2206
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,640
connection between the internal and the

2207
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,880
external states conditioned upon all of

2208
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,320
that and then that's the bayesian

2209
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,600
mechanics

2210
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,440
in which internal states on average

2211
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,000
parameterized beliefs of a bayesian sort

2212
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,080
about external states

2213
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,040
okay

2214
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,280
so

2215
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,040
some of the implications in the last few

2216
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,120
slides here so clearly the worked

2217
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,800
example based upon sparsely coupled

2218
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,560
lorenz systems does not mean that a

2219
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,040
conditional synchronization map exists

2220
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,960
or is indeed invertible which would

2221
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,040
allow the tail of two densities the

2222
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,440
recognition and the generative model

2223
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,480
in any given system

2224
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,199
so you can't just specify any system

2225
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,719
potentially and find a conditional

2226
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,480
synchronization map

2227
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,320
however the above derivations can be

2228
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,560
taken as existence of proof that such

2229
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,120
manifolds and accompanying variational

2230
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,360
free energy formulation can emerge from

2231
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,679
sufficiently sparse coupling

2232
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:26,480
so

2233
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,560
this is one system classic system of

2234
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,199
complexity analysis and it worked here

2235
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,320
maybe there's other systems where it

2236
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,159
will or won't

2237
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,000
a particular partition is necessary to

2238
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,520
talk about states that are internal to

2239
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,360
some particle or person

2240
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,880
and which can be distinguished from

2241
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,440
external states one way of understanding

2242
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,600
the ensuing coupling between internal

2243
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,120
and external states is in terms of

2244
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,800
generalized synchrony that's that

2245
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,040
synchronization manifold

2246
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,719
this synchronization can be expressed as

2247
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,560
a variational principle of least action

2248
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,040
using the notation

2249
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,360
notion of variational free energy so

2250
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,600
this is from another decosta paper the

2251
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,440
synthesis on discrete state spaces and

2252
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,159
it is uh talking about how that

2253
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,639
variational free energy minimization of

2254
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,679
perception and planning as inference

2255
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,960
about observations

2256
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,520
can be seen as a generalization

2257
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,920
here's active inference

2258
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,080
um if you have no prior

2259
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,239
then you're you have surprise pure

2260
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,920
surprise optimal surprise intrinsic

2261
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,719
motivation info gain info max principle

2262
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:31,840
because it's just about what's

2263
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,560
surprising given no priors when there's

2264
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,159
no ambiguity

2265
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:38,800
so when there is a model that abstracts

2266
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,920
away from for example measurement error

2267
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,239
you have risk sensitive policies and

2268
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,480
kl divergence based control and occam's

2269
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,400
principle and there's other cases like

2270
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,920
bayesian decision theory expected

2271
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,080
utility theory as well as maximum

2272
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,120
entropy and jane so it's kind of

2273
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,199
um there's a lot of

2274
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,560
pieces that are coming into play when we

2275
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,639
talk about active inference

2276
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,199
probably some that will still are

2277
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,130
yet to learn

2278
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,239
[Music]

2279
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,560
but there are some pretty interesting

2280
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,719
patterns arising from this partitioning

2281
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,760
here's another form another implication

2282
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,600
so the polynomial form of the helmholtz

2283
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,800
decomposition from formalism 5

2284
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,560
may provide a generic model for observe

2285
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,960
random dynamical systems in other words

2286
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,880
it could be the basis of a forward or

2287
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,400
generative model that explains some

2288
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,000
empirically observed flow

2289
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,679
estimated using the first and second

2290
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,280
moments to quantify the flow and

2291
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,360
covariance of random fluctuations over

2292
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,600
state space respectively

2293
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,040
this kind of generative model is

2294
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,000
appealing because of its

2295
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,600
parameterization in terms of the

2296
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,520
underlying non-equilibrium steady state

2297
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,840
density in other words one could in

2298
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,920
principle try to explain empirical data

2299
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,360
in terms of a gaussian steady state

2300
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,000
density which may include constraints on

2301
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,679
conditional dependencies so let's

2302
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,520
think back to the beginning with flow

2303
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,400
and

2304
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,440
information flow and mental flow and

2305
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,519
grain it um moving down a

2306
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,320
quarry or all these kinds of flow and

2307
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,920
then could there be something that

2308
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,960
integrates across them

2309
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,120
another option for scaling this approach

2310
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,719
to high dimensional dynamical systems

2311
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,320
would be to learn the state dependency

2312
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,080
of the flow operator and the

2313
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,920
non-equilibrium steady state density

2314
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,679
using unsupervised learning approaches

2315
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,080
such as deep neural networks

2316
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,239
a similar approach has become popular in

2317
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,600
the deep learning literature in the form

2318
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,440
of neural stochastic differential

2319
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,440
equations

2320
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,920
so here's two recent stochastic

2321
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,280
differential equation papers

2322
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,639
and then

2323
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,239
they bring up this very interesting

2324
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,360
suggestion

2325
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,120
one could use a separate feed-forward

2326
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,800
neural network to parameterize the

2327
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,159
different components of the flow

2328
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,480
operator and the self-information

2329
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,920
this would require differentiable

2330
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,679
transforms to be applied to the output

2331
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,199
layers of the network to constrain the

2332
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,360
hessian and solenoidal flow operator to

2333
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,280
be positive definite and antisymmetric

2334
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,440
respectively so

2335
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,120
suggesting

2336
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,600
some neural network architectures that

2337
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,400
might

2338
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,080
facilitate

2339
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,880
active inference

2340
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,840
then this is a pretty nice

2341
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,600
piece it is interesting to relate flows

2342
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,960
across a markov boundary to the

2343
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,639
constructal law

2344
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,000
which like the free energy principle

2345
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,280
seeks a normative account of the

2346
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,719
structure and dynamics of complex

2347
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:23,840
systems

2348
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,520
in the case of the constructor law this

2349
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,360
is articulated in terms of maximizing

2350
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,040
external access

2351
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,159
to the currents internal to the system

2352
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,280
so

2353
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,679
here is um adrian bajan

2354
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,400
who's like a awesome professor

2355
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,719
and researcher who has done many years

2356
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,040
of work

2357
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,440
like fristen in some ways

2358
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,840
um on this construct the law so i was

2359
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,800
quite

2360
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,239
happy to see that connection

2361
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,040
here's another final implication one

2362
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,880
practical implication finally the

2363
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,199
practical implication great

2364
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,760
it licenses the use of inverse sample

2365
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,840
covariance matrices of a sufficiently

2366
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,320
long time series as petition potentially

2367
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,679
sufficient description of the steady

2368
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,360
state density

2369
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,280
so we could take a real time series and

2370
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,880
fit that laplacian approximation

2371
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,560
this would furnish a description of the

2372
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,560
expected flow and leopard of exponents

2373
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,080
to establish whether the system was

2374
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,320
chaotic or not

2375
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,920
in conclusion

2376
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,520
last sentence

2377
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,120
having a simple functional form for the

2378
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,440
flow of random dynamical systems may be

2379
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,360
useful for both modeling

2380
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,840
and analyzing time series generated by

2381
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,520
real-world processes that are far from

2382
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,920
equilibrium that may or may not be

2383
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,440
chaotic

2384
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,719
so we can think of two chaotic systems

2385
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,600
the humans and the ants and then

2386
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,880
everything else

2387
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,120
so

2388
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,360
pretty interesting paper

2389
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,679
um

2390
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,040
the coming two weeks hopefully we'll

2391
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,560
have some good group discussions we're

2392
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,480
going to email the authors now that

2393
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,360
we've done our work on the dot zero and

2394
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,520
would be awesome to have them on for the

2395
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,520
two discussions we'll have or for any

2396
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,960
other time

2397
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,920
um

2398
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,639
thanks everybody who was watching i hope

2399
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,560
if you are watching to the end you found

2400
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,000
this interesting and

2401
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,760
come get involved with active lab

2402
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,920
because

2403
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,159
we could all have some shared resources

2404
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:25,920
so that some of these questions that are

2405
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,239
really being advanced in this paper

2406
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,120
like

2407
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,880
the connections to complexity and

2408
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,080
dynamical systems theory and

2409
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,520
statistical thermodynamics um these are

2410
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,560
important contributions and this is not

2411
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,639
a fringe apologetics for active

2412
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,719
inference it's barely mentioned in the

2413
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,320
paper it's actually some really

2414
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,120
fundamental work that

2415
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,159
i hope

2416
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,800
is understood and critiqued

2417
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,360
where valid so what would a good

2418
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,440
understanding here enable of the kinds

2419
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,639
of things that are discussed in this

2420
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,600
paper which came out in 2021 but think

2421
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,760
into the future

2422
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,600
what are the unique predictions and

2423
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,920
implications of this paper what are the

2424
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,320
next steps for fep and active inference

2425
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,159
what are the goals of this research and

2426
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,560
what are you still curious about

2427
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,600
so

2428
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,719
thanks for sticking around for a long

2429
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,199
live stream at a different time but

2430
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,480
so it goes

2431
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,199
so have a good one everyone hopefully

2432
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:28,080
see you around the lab or around

2433
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,080
bye
