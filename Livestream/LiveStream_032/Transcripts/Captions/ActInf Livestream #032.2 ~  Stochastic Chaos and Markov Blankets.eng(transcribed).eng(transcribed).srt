hello everyone welcome to actin flab to

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
act in flab live stream number 32.2 it's

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
november 16 2021

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
welcome to the active lab

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,199
we are a participatory online lab that

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,000
is communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,480
applied active inference you can find us

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,520
at some of the links here on this slide

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
this is recorded and an archived live

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
stream so please provide us with

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,320
feedback so we can improve on our work

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,119
welcome here and we'll be following good

17
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
and fun video etiquette for live streams

18
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,119
at this short link you can see some of

19
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,360
the upcoming streams this is our second

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
participatory group discussion on the

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
stochastic chaos and markov blankets

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
paper

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,159
and then in the second two weeks of

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
november we're going to be discussing

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
thinking like a state by our friend and

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
co-participant aval and we haven't yet

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
set the papers for december so if you

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,400
know an author who you'd like to invite

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
or if you yourself would like to join

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
for several weeks of discussion of one

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,720
of your works then just let us know

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
today in active stream number 32.2 we're

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
aiming to learn and discuss and ask

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
what if and what is and hold all these

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
different questions at once

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
we're in the second participatory

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
discussion around the paper stochastic

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
chaos and markov blankets by fristen

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,639
heinz ultzhoffer decosta and par

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,959
and last week we had an awesome

41
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
discussion in the dot one

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
and we uh got right up to the

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,239
cliffhanger where the the m word

44
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,879
actually was deployed and i think today

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
we're gonna um sprint up to that cliff

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
and then jump off so it'll be a fun

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
discussion for those who are watching

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
live

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
totally right questions and comments in

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
the live chat and stephen and dean and i

51
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
and anyone else who joins will be just

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
more than happy to

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
hear what you have to share and to um

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
[Music]

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
roll with it as you write things so

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,200
let's begin just by giving a

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
introduction or warm-up so

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
we can say hello and then also just

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
maybe what was exciting about the paper

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,480
overall or since we all participated in

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
the dot one

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
what are you looking forward to in the

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,519
dot 2

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
or maybe how have you changed how you

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
thought about it over the previous week

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,599
california

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
and

69
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
i'll save what i'm excited for until a

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
little bit later and i'll pass it to

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
dean

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
hey good morning uh my name is dean i'm

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,560
in calgary uh in the

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
in the one weeks time since we

75
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
left off i

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
i think this paper more than many of the

77
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,480
other people we've had conversations

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
around breathes life into something that

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
is typically perceived as

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
not very

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
alive it's just it's just a sort of a

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,000
point to and an explanation of but i

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
think this is one of those

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,959
papers where

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,640
when people pick it up and start having

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
conversations with one another about

87
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,560
the kind of work that's being done here

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
it makes it really really interesting

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
doesn't give us necessarily

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
the answers that the authors

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
could project would be given and i

92
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,680
really like that

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
thank you dean stephen i'll pass it to

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
stephen

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
good morning as well from toronto um

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,238
i'm really interested in this paper i

97
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
think because it

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
it does um give a unifying

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
perspective it does help with that

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
unifying perspective even though at

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
first when you see things like

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
stochastic chaos it can be like oh we're

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
going down another rabbit hole etcetera

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
etcetera

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
um but actually

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
rather than always justifying or talking

107
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
about applied active influence influence

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
through applications and quotient

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
applications there is some benefit to

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
this kind of coming to the foundation

111
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
and so i'm excited by that and also

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
actually following the conversation

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
we're having earlier in the fact that we

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
have this um complexity weekend

115
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
is some of the ways that complexity can

116
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,960
be talked about outside of a more

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,039
woo-woo kind of

118
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,560
conversational sense at these

119
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
foundational levels which again seems to

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,800
get into unnecessary

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
um detail

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
ultimately i think it starts to allow

123
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
some of these crossovers between

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
applications of complexity and this to

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
happen which for me personally i don't

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
think i was necessarily able to

127
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
articulate a year ago so i think

128
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
some of this work

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
does just help fill in some of those

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
gaps

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
thanks i agree like the system that's

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
picked up and turned around and

133
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
remodeled throughout the course of the

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
paper in a very

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
narrative driven way is the lorenz

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,960
attractor which is like the classic

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
complex systems model

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
so it just kind of

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,880
plays into

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
contemporary work on complexity and

141
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,400
so many other areas

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
but and then also dean i i really like

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,080
what you said like

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,639
the authors i hope will be able to join

145
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,600
for a future presentation so we're in

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
contact they probably won't join today

147
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,360
but

148
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
what the authors are putting out there

149
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
and then how that's received and

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,080
communicated around and explored

151
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
that's what's fun and um

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
i know that we'll have many

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,759
cool things to explore today

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
so let's

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
jump to the big questions

156
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
then we'll look at the road map and try

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
to remember where we got to yesterday

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
and maybe a different big question is

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
striking either of you or anyone in the

160
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
live chat today and then we'll

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
try to remember how far on our road trip

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,639
we got

163
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
last tuesday and then let's see which

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
sections we're going to get to and we

165
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
have a bunch of other things kind of

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
written down so the big questions that

167
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
we had previously asked were what is a

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
good model of thingness in a chaotic

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
dynamic anticipative world

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
how might this model or approach to

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
thingness speak to system sentience

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,319
and then there in little tiny

173
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,840
font it's a sentence not in the

174
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
phenomenological

175
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,080
like experiential

176
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
but greeting cerval good to see you

177
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
but sentience in the set in the sense of

178
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
feeling thinking and feeling systems

179
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
without uh worrying about the first

180
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
person experience side at least in this

181
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,639
paper

182
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
and then the

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
key technical question of this paper

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
which

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
broaches onto

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,919
a million and a half other areas is what

187
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
is a markov blanket just what are these

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
blankets

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,879
and how is one modeled identified

190
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
defined statistically what are the pros

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
and cons of different approaches and so

192
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
that's some of the technical details

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
that we'll get to so steven thanks for

194
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
raising your hand and then welcome

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
serval after that feel free to say hello

196
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,639
and introduce yourself if you'd like

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
yeah i'm curious and i notice here um

198
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
that we start with thingness which i do

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
agree is

200
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,599
this big question of thingness um is

201
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,639
something that

202
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
karl fuston brings up quite a lot but i

203
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
think he's often

204
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
he's the he in that part i feel he's

205
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
often a bit of a lone voice in terms of

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
really pushing the thing this side of

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
things and i think it's really

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
interesting that second question then of

209
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
okay how does that speak to system

210
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,639
sentience

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
and you see now we move into systems

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,679
right

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
and okay thing this sort of

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
to me is it gives rise to systems and

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
gives rise to sentience however

216
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
i think it's thing this is still there

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
right things are still the game in some

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
ways are being maintained so that first

219
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,279
question

220
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
because when we then get into the third

221
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
question things can get lost

222
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
and it's all about system sentience and

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
i think there's something really

224
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
interesting there because

225
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
um

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
there is a question of i mean it's it's

227
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
even as we say in those brackets what it

228
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
really means to have system sentience

229
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,760
or even just system is

230
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,959
probably rather ill defined and and i

231
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,200
suppose to some extent is how much is it

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
even needed

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
how much can thingness be maintained

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
as an equal partner in the game and not

235
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
sort of passed over once we scale so i

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
think that's a good good piece of

237
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
provocation

238
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
thank you and to what extent can things

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
and systems be identified in a bottom-up

240
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
way from

241
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
measurements of dynamical systems

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,640
serval would you like to add anything or

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
say hello

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
or bonjour

245
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
hello i'm turbo

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
i'm a complexity scientist

247
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
i founded the chemistry social

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,839
laboratory which is interested in

249
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
building uh

250
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
inactive models of social political

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
changes and i'm here

252
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
to

253
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
see the discussion around the formalism

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
of the paper which i did not

255
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
revise and i therefore cannot make

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
informed comments on

257
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,600
thank you sir

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
dean

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
i just want to add one thing to what

260
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
stephen was talking about there

261
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
i think what

262
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,480
the big questions and what this paper

263
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
addresses pretty directly is

264
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,000
can we

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
can we accept a minimum of two that

266
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,839
there's an abstraction

267
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
and that there's a material

268
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
aspect to thingness

269
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,839
and one and marrying those two things

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,079
is is kind of what

271
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
we're hoping to be able to do but but it

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
it comes in two very discreet forms

273
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
so

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
so

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
what of that

276
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
we call it thingness because it kind of

277
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,839
spans

278
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
both realms

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
and that's what i think i take away from

280
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
the idea that it can be chaotic

281
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,599
and not

282
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,160
absolutely there's the map in the

283
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
territory

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
and

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
one thing that we're gonna return to is

286
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
like

287
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
the first map that we apply to the

288
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
territory so already we're separating

289
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
the territory in the map but even the

290
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
first map can be chaotic

291
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,640
and then can we put a second map

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,040
the laplacian approximation as it turns

293
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
out in the paper can that second map

294
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
be one that gives us some properties

295
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,160
that make it more tractable to handle

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
like

297
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
you know potholders taking something hot

298
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
out of the oven give a better grip

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,560
on the first map which gives a better

300
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
grip in terms of actionable insight into

301
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
the territory can that second level

302
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
both be more tractable especially using

303
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
computers but also retain those chaotic

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
properties which we're going to see when

305
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
they estimate the lyapunov exponent of

306
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
the laprosian approximation

307
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
so

308
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
that's the recursion prior to the rep

309
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
the repetitiveness

310
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
that's what i think this really gets

311
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,519
into recursion modeling

312
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,240
thanksgiving so stephen

313
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
yeah i'm gonna put this as maybe a

314
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
little bit of a question as well but

315
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,279
it's rhetorical if it doesn't want to be

316
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,079
answered but i think that

317
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,160
the thingness and the markov blanket

318
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,000
because we're getting to that stage here

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
um

320
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
there is this

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,399
there's i think this tends to be a sense

322
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
that okay we have a thing and because

323
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,000
it's

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
it's trying to sort of maintain itself

325
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,959
in a just

326
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
dissipative world

327
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
then

328
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
that's effectively a system

329
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
because it's got a markup blanket and

330
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
we're in that world but with this it's

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,279
like look you've got lorenz attractor

332
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
then lorenz attractor goes into

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
thingness

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,440
right

335
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
now

336
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
what and then thing this potentially

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,839
goes into

338
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
probably with a few phases system

339
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
sentient system so the question is which

340
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
side of the which side of thing this

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
is markov blanket

342
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
does markov blanket emerge

343
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
from him from going from lorenz

344
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
attractor into thingness

345
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
and then continue or does it is like

346
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,040
lorenzo tractor into thinness into

347
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,399
markovian

348
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
blanketed thickness

349
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
um

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
curious what your thoughts are on that

351
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,639
and maybe this paper shed some light on

352
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,959
that

353
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,320
great question let's look at the road

354
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
map

355
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
and just

356
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,040
see how that comes into play

357
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,760
so we talked in 32.1 about a few

358
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
different ideas and we have some slides

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
ready with just

360
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,639
tabula rasa if we'd like to add notes or

361
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
we can always modify slides and deal

362
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
with questions as people are raising

363
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,600
them

364
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,800
let's go to the roadmap though okay

365
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
so the the roadmap of the paper is as

366
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,639
follows

367
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
in section one there's an introduction

368
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
in section two

369
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
there is

370
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
from dynamics to densities so this is

371
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
one of the really fundamental kind of

372
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
linking events early in the paper

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
where dynamical systems

374
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
dynamics

375
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
are linked to flow systems like

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
densities

377
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,839
so

378
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
this equivalence between dynamical

379
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
systems and density driven systems

380
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
is going to be finessed extensively in

381
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
the paper so that's an introductory step

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
that's very important to note

383
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
the helmholtz decomposition

384
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
is a tool from vector calculus that

385
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
applies very well to densities

386
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
and flows where it's usually applied

387
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
but because of what links were made in

388
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
section 2

389
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
it becomes possible to take that

390
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
helmholtz decomposition approach to

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
dynamical systems

392
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
that is specifically visited and

393
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
revisited and then moved beyond in the

394
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
lorenz system

395
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
that's one of those classical chaotic

396
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,240
systems and a favorite toy of

397
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
complexity analysis

398
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
the lorenzo system is moved beyond

399
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,079
and then approximated with a laplacian

400
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,040
and then

401
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
even moved beyond there so that's pretty

402
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
much where we got to

403
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,560
last week we tried to do a really

404
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,240
solid grounding in first the equivalence

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,480
between dynamical systems and density

406
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
driven systems or two kind of

407
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
representations of underlying systems

408
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
that could be seen as equivalent

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
and then we talked about the lorenzo

410
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
system and about how it's chaotic and

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
how chaotic means like sensitivity to

412
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,959
small changes

413
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,440
as quantified by the lore by the

414
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
lyapuniv exponent

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
and then we talked about how the

416
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
laplacian approximation which is kind of

417
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
like fitting a quadratic which is kind

418
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
of like letting the ball roll to the

419
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,680
bottom of the bowl and this idea of like

420
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
well if we can phrase the problem like a

421
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,279
bowl

422
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
then all we have to do is roll to the

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
bottom there's only one bottom

424
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
and we know which slope we're on so

425
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,759
that's also called convex optimization

426
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
because no matter where you are if you

427
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
know that the problem is shaped like a

428
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
quadratic curve like a bowl

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
you can just instantaneously estimate

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
the slope of the bowl and then just run

431
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,360
downhill

432
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,920
whereas if you're on a rugged landscape

433
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,079
just you know you're lost in a mountain

434
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
region we'll go downhill

435
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,199
you're going to get trapped into a

436
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,880
valley potentially and you might not

437
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
make it out to the ocean

438
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,399
but if you could re-imagine that rugged

439
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
landscape in a way that was more bowl

440
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
like it would allow for

441
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,279
tractable

442
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,880
estimation of which way to move

443
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
in section 4 we get to the markov

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
blanket concept and the free energy

445
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
principle and i think that's going to be

446
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
the really fascinating discussion is

447
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,199
like

448
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
okay so let's

449
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,039
get what that markov

450
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
blanket what is that partitioning what

451
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
are we really talking about

452
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
and then are we talking about

453
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,319
the territory

454
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,359
are we talking about the lorenz map or

455
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
are we talking about the laplacian map

456
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,120
where is this blanket partitioning

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
coming into the picture

458
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
and then how does that help us reduce

459
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
our uncertainty about systems

460
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
and what does it say or not about that

461
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
underlying system and that's where we're

462
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
going to be talking about particular

463
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,559
partitions

464
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,520
of course a favorite and recurrent pun

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
which is that particular means specific

466
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,480
but also it means like a particle like a

467
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
autonomous particle drifting around in

468
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
space

469
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,600
and then section five

470
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,240
really comes to a

471
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
culmination

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
with a discussion of the free energy

473
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
principle alone

474
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
and so i think it'll be interesting to

475
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
discuss like what is subsumed into the

476
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,640
free energy principle and why do we need

477
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
one section mark on blankets and free

478
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,480
energy principle and then another

479
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,080
section on just the free energy

480
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
principle so that's kind of the road map

481
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
steven and then d

482
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
yeah just a quick question see if this

483
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
clarifies something which i think is

484
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
what you're saying

485
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,840
dynamics is um

486
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
the dynamics more particular flow like

487
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,320
it's and densities

488
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,880
while you could have a density of

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,320
particles it's actually more like a

490
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
probability density

491
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
on wave functions would i be right in

492
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
thinking is if there's a kind of a wave

493
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
particle

494
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
or part actually a particle then wave

495
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
way into this and that's

496
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,679
partly how they're

497
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,799
playing this out

498
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,160
someone with

499
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,919
more experience with the formalism would

500
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,320
be totally open to their

501
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
contributions on that question my first

502
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
take would be

503
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,760
you could make a dynamical systems model

504
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
like equations of motion for

505
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,200
a particle floating around and so it's

506
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,760
like you're focusing on the first second

507
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
and third derivatives of movements

508
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
in x y z space or tetrahedral space for

509
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
some particle so a dynamical system

510
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
model could be describing the movement

511
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,039
of a particle

512
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,760
but

513
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,360
the um

514
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
flow that gives rise to the movement of

515
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,039
that particle is it's kind of like

516
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
figure and ground like the dynamical

517
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
equation features the movement of that

518
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
particle like i want to know the

519
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
pendulum's location

520
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
and so that's going to be a dynamical

521
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,160
model of the pendulum whereas the flow

522
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
based models

523
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
like you pointed out are much more about

524
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
well what is the underlying space of the

525
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
flow of that pendulum so it's like if

526
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
it's to the left of the bottom it's like

527
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,679
it flows this way and if it's to the

528
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,159
right it's like it flows that way and so

529
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,880
that is about asking what is the

530
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,480
underlying flow dynamics that do give

531
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
rise to movement of potentially

532
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
particles

533
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,440
and those are why this meme is on the

534
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
slide and why they are made in

535
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
equivalence early in the paper because

536
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,080
it is like talking about the difference

537
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
between the movements of a point through

538
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
a space

539
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,520
versus

540
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
understanding the flow dynamics of that

541
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
space that yes does give rise to the

542
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
movement of particles

543
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
ah and could i just ask one so what you

544
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
almost it goes from a

545
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,320
just purely the um you know the momentum

546
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
of a particle to this flow

547
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
and the flow is kind of a bridge then

548
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
between density dynamics which is maybe

549
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,039
more of a probability density of

550
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
where it could be which can map both to

551
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
an object where an object might be but

552
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,480
also where a wave function might be

553
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
in in broad sense so then you're

554
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
sort of going from literal particles

555
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
in a classical sense to the flow

556
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
and then the flow then bridges into

557
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
density dynamics which is can be more

558
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
probability orientated is that

559
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
fair to say

560
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
yes

561
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
particle is going to take a particular

562
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
meaning a little bit later when we talk

563
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,960
about the partitioning of states but i

564
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
believe that's correct and also the

565
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
density

566
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
like you suggested

567
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,640
ties much more closely to statistical

568
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
density distributions like in statistics

569
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
we're often interested in density

570
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
distributions

571
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,679
of special type like the area under the

572
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
distribution summing to one the integral

573
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
over a distribution being one

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
allows us to treat it like a probability

575
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
distribution and so that's the whole

576
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,520
debate in quantum is it actually a wave

577
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
or does that

578
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
distribution

579
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,960
of positional uncertainty merely

580
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
describe our statistical inference on

581
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
the location of something that's at a

582
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
specific point

583
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,679
so

584
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,240
whichever side we want to come at this

585
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,200
from

586
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,080
section two says it's gonna be okay to

587
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,880
use both and we're gonna sometimes lean

588
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,039
more on our left leg and sometimes we're

589
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,200
gonna lean more on our right leg because

590
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
there's tools that exist for one but not

591
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,320
the other dean

592
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
yeah i don't know if this

593
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
begins to answer steven's rhetorical

594
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,240
question but i think

595
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
where

596
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
most people get introduced to a markov

597
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,000
blanket they get introduced to the idea

598
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,919
that it's either a way of partitioning

599
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,480
and dividing or it's a way of being able

600
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
to envelop or blanket and i think what

601
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
the paper points out is that it's both

602
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,840
all the time so you can for example find

603
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
a box of cookies

604
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
and see all the cookies settling at the

605
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,480
bottom

606
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,039
whereas or if the person is you know

607
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
described as being creative

608
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
uses that box of cookies as a leverage

609
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
point to get more cookies off the top

610
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
shelf now it's a platform

611
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
and now it's a mound

612
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
and so we can see it both ways at once

613
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,000
if we think of it as both ways at once

614
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
it's not an or a question it's that

615
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
minimum of two piece again that that is

616
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
really fascinating about this that

617
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,159
really kind of blows people up it's

618
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,240
really both at once then you decide

619
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,000
which it's going to be

620
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
and that's what i think is really

621
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880
fascinating for people who are just sort

622
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
of start getting into this because they

623
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,799
they've been so habituated to saying oh

624
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,559
it's it's a cookie jar

625
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,120
oh it's a platform no it's both

626
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
and that's that's what we want to do

627
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
thanks dean and um marco in the chat

628
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
wrote like a boat in a stormy sea it

629
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
moves at the mercy of the seas and winds

630
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,360
flowing forces with only its rudder

631
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
sales and other limited mechanisms to

632
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
steward the world's influence on its

633
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,400
journey so bucky meme one unity is

634
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
plural at minimum two bucky meme two on

635
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
his gravestone call me trim tab kind of

636
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,760
like the rudder and that is exactly

637
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,720
getting at the point of this paper which

638
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
is if we just were talking about a dust

639
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
molecule floating in the air then we

640
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
could say well we could use the

641
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
dynamical systems model

642
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
of the position of the dust particle or

643
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,919
we could do inference on the flow of the

644
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,960
room

645
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,559
and that gives us a different and

646
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,159
complementary totally co-extant picture

647
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,240
but that's a dust molecule

648
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,039
what about active systems that have

649
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,600
affordances that are able to

650
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,880
do inference on action selection

651
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
choose different policies

652
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
how do those active systems

653
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,799
do inference that's the winged snowflake

654
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,360
that's the moth to the flame and those

655
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,520
are the really exciting systems and that

656
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,279
also speaks to the difference between

657
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,159
what's called mere active inference like

658
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
the particle

659
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,559
where we can still have this

660
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,080
partitioning and still see it as a

661
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,960
dynamics or a flow versus the adaptive

662
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
active inference which is then we're

663
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,960
thinking about those systems where the

664
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,760
particle the particular states

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,559
are able to effect different policies

666
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,240
and select between them

667
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
in a way that acts as if it's resisting

668
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
dissipation and those are the kind of

669
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
exciting systems that we want to get to

670
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
by the end of the paper stephen

671
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
and

672
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,279
pulling on that idea of um

673
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,640
cookie jar

674
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
is the there's the the cookie jar is

675
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,559
maybe a almost a particle a thing

676
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,799
that is like leveraged and there's a

677
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,000
thinness

678
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,760
which it becomes

679
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,120
so it say it has a thing about it but

680
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,679
there's a thinness of of being

681
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,120
an affordance

682
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
so this is an interesting just sort of

683
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
came to me but the thing this in itself

684
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
is slightly emergent because there's

685
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,799
the the only by the process of trying to

686
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,120
use it to get the higher cookie does

687
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,200
another kind of thing emerge which

688
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
becomes a step

689
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
so there's something interesting there

690
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
about the nests

691
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,720
um as as an emergent you know is it ever

692
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
a step

693
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,159
really

694
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,679
but it's always

695
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
it's never not a thing

696
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,080
at the same time so there's a i think

697
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
there's something quite interesting

698
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
there in that emergent stroke

699
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,360
flow stroke you know literal sense

700
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
and also

701
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
i don't know to what extent this is um

702
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,919
intentional but thinness

703
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,440
we talk a lot about ness the

704
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,960
non-equilibrium steady state or

705
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,760
non-equilibrium stationary states and so

706
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
it's like the things

707
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,799
ness

708
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
that's the thing the thing we're talking

709
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,200
about is the thing's ness

710
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
so we're not talking and saying that the

711
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
system

712
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
is at stationarity we're saying that the

713
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
things nests

714
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,919
by virtue of how we're modeling it

715
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
has stationary characteristics

716
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,120
and that is the thing as we model it

717
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
which is that

718
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
always existing difference between the

719
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,000
map and the territory we're not saying

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,440
that the territory is even a thing we're

721
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,679
saying the way we're relating and

722
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,000
interacting with the map which we

723
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
totally made no one's going to deny that

724
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,159
that maps

725
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,159
things-ness

726
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,480
is tractable i can hold the map in my

727
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
hands that gives me better grip on my

728
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,799
road trip

729
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,600
steven

730
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,880
that's a really

731
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,520
yeah i think also the

732
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,480
the thickness can tie into

733
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,799
the idea that something

734
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
ontologically

735
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
comes into being through relation

736
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
through some sort of network dynamic

737
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
um in which it acts

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,039
um

739
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,559
and that that actually that speaks to

740
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,039
this lorenz attractor you know so the

741
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,399
lorenz

742
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,200
becomes part of a network of an ontology

743
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
of thing which is really a thing in

744
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,559
relation to what some other thing is

745
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,360
like

746
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,559
you know because obviously the scale of

747
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
the cookie box is quite a lot different

748
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,520
to the scale of the atoms in the cookie

749
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
box or the

750
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
whatever scale we want to so there's

751
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
that and then there's some sort of

752
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
affordance level

753
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
and maybe we can get out of the whole

754
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,880
sentient system thing and it's like it's

755
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
just an affordance for the thinness to

756
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
maintain thingness

757
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
it doesn't need to know about systems as

758
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
such

759
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
unless someone some creature happens to

760
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,799
evolve a brain which starts to sit down

761
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,600
working out system diagrams

762
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
two-legged ones potentially

763
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
um

764
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,440
otherwise it's like it's just things all

765
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,559
the way up right

766
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,679
let's

767
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,200
now that we're

768
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,679
30 fun minutes in

769
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,640
let's um sprint up to that

770
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,640
markov cliff and then see where we go

771
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,360
so

772
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,919
figure one of the paper

773
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:02,799
is

774
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
kind of making this first fundamental

775
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,159
connection between the lorenz system as

776
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,760
defined by dynamical equations so

777
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,159
the traditional lorenz is defined more

778
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,480
like the blue version within equations

779
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
of motion

780
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,120
um well it has a positive lyopine

781
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
exponent which is to say that very

782
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
closely

783
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,520
located points diverge rather than stay

784
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
in like a laminar flow parallel line

785
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,520
world or converging so they diverge

786
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,200
and that's what makes lorenz system

787
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,840
chaotic ergo difficult to predict

788
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
measurement error and tiny perturbations

789
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,159
due to even thermal noise which is like

790
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
kind of how pseudorandom number

791
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,080
generators work

792
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,200
and then

793
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
there's going to be an approximation

794
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,080
based upon this stochastic solution

795
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
and so the trajectory in the right panel

796
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,520
here it's the deterministic solution to

797
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,080
the laplacian form of the lorenz

798
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
based upon the helmholtz decomposition

799
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
and so this is sort of like the version

800
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,399
on the right that's usually seen and the

801
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,240
state space model is almost like we're

802
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,720
sampling stochastically from points

803
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
along that race track

804
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
so that was

805
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
figure one

806
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
we could you just could you just explain

807
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,679
that just go over that one more time

808
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,240
just to clarify that bit i think i

809
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,080
understand what you're saying but

810
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
it's kind of an important point you make

811
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,399
there

812
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,320
when you say deterministic solution

813
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,799
that i didn't

814
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,279
there is that that went just to clarify

815
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
what that means

816
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,279
so the deterministic solution

817
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,880
would have no

818
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,919
noise

819
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,559
so that the

820
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,440
position at the following time is

821
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,760
entirely determined

822
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,080
by the

823
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
non-stochastic

824
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
state that it's in at the preceding

825
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,360
moment

826
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,679
whereas when we talk about a stochastic

827
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,720
form

828
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,760
it's like

829
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
that's like your car's driving

830
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
and there's thermal vibrations on the

831
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
road now

832
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,880
the leopard if exponent on that car at

833
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,480
non-zero temperature

834
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,919
is small so that the flow term dominates

835
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,720
the vibratory term but there could be

836
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
some other system where

837
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,559
the difference between well if it's in

838
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
the absolute zero world and just on the

839
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,519
road then it's going to go straight but

840
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,159
once you introduce any

841
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,000
wiggling

842
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,080
when the system is chaotic it has that

843
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,120
positive leopard exponent then the

844
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,440
tiniest wiggle causes the system to

845
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,840
diverge

846
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,000
really helpful because and so basically

847
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,440
normally we just like with the

848
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,039
deterministic thing it's just whatever

849
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,559
the initial conditions if it varies

850
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
slightly but then once it runs it will

851
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
settle into something but if you

852
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,360
you've got the initial condition and

853
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,679
you've got the perturbations due to

854
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,679
noise

855
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,159
as it's actually running which adds i

856
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,919
suppose you could say a little bit of an

857
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,120
extra

858
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
change in initial conditions to each

859
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,080
state that the lorenz attractor is

860
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
moving through so okay that's that's

861
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
helpful thanks daniel yes and i'm gonna

862
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,039
just show this image this is um

863
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
i don't know if it's the very very first

864
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,840
but this is the image that lorenz

865
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,159
used to talk about chaos in 1961.

866
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,039
so i mean what's the difference between

867
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,880
76.8 and 76.85

868
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,200
it's imperceptible if your thermometer

869
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
only had like three significant figures

870
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,360
you wouldn't even be able to talk about

871
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,440
the difference but i mean how different

872
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,480
can it be

873
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,960
and it turns out that these those two

874
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,039
systems start imperceptibly different

875
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,399
but

876
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,880
nearby points in chaotic systems do

877
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,399
diverge and so it's like okay but

878
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
they're still tracking each other right

879
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,159
it's like well no wrong

880
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,880
later on and so of course a more chaotic

881
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,960
system with a more positively open of

882
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,120
exponent diverges faster but any system

883
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,039
with a positive leading leopard of

884
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,840
exponent is going to have divergence

885
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,880
and so

886
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
if you have a purely deterministic

887
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,720
system

888
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
or one without this kind of the openiv

889
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,960
induced chaos

890
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,679
then you can predict far out

891
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,039
however

892
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,519
prediction matter experts as dean i'm

893
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,480
sure will revisit us too

894
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,080
meet their match

895
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,480
with chaotic systems and that's actually

896
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
one thing i hope that we get to by the

897
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,559
end which is that by putting action in

898
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,159
every loop and inference on action

899
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
we can still whichever of these

900
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,159
timelines we end up on

901
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
we're going to be doing okay

902
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,960
because we're always re-adjusting

903
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
our inference to whichever of these

904
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,120
mountains we're on it's not like one of

905
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,679
these is better or worse or more or less

906
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,960
challenging like they have the exact

907
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,799
same upper and lower bound

908
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,039
the only mistake would be to make a

909
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,640
prediction and be super confident about

910
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,159
it and be on the wrong predictive

911
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,199
timeline

912
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
but as long as we're always updating our

913
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,159
predictions

914
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,040
then

915
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,159
either of these days are gonna be okay

916
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,000
but if we put on the jacket because we

917
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,839
thought that it was gonna be cold here

918
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,480
and that's when it was hottest then

919
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
we're injured

920
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,440
but if we just think okay well we know

921
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,879
we have the jacket afford in so we're

922
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
just gonna keep an eye on that as we

923
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,560
watch the temperature and continue to

924
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,800
update our predictions maybe then it'll

925
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,839
be okay

926
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,599
so that was the

927
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,440
initial lorenz

928
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,199
attractor

929
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,280
section three goes into the helmholtz

930
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,119
decomposition which we've talked about

931
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,359
in several other streams

932
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,960
and um

933
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,000
we've seen it introduced as the

934
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,079
breaking down of a vector field the

935
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,679
total current in this kind of

936
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
electromagnetic representation

937
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
into the irrotational

938
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,599
which is kind of like the straight line

939
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,200
there's no rotation in those straight

940
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,560
lines and the purely rotational

941
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,960
solenoidal current flow currency

942
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
we've talked about solenoidal ingredient

943
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,760
partitioning and then what this paper

944
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
does and i think

945
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,800
the technical details are in the

946
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
appendix b

947
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,640
of 16. so that was the bayesian

948
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,119
mechanics paper

949
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,040
and then also there's this housekeeping

950
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
big lambda

951
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,599
and that's in one of the appendices to

952
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,520
this paper so that would be like

953
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
something for

954
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
someone else to help us understand a

955
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,240
little bit of because it does matter

956
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
and it's actually a key contribution

957
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,440
because

958
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
if

959
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,040
the landscape is changing moment to

960
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,920
moment

961
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,079
you can't just do the helmholtz

962
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,920
decomposition once

963
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
and sail on that c

964
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,599
without updating

965
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,040
your estimate of the partitioning here

966
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,240
of the decomposition here

967
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,400
that

968
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,800
decomposition so again dynamical systems

969
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
that's like the position of the car and

970
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,040
then we're going to because of section

971
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,880
two be

972
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
having an equivalence between that

973
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,520
dynamics and the flow modeling

974
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
and one of the terms that shows up on

975
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,520
both of these

976
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,440
is the fancy j fancy i it's the self

977
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
information

978
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
the first part performs a riemannian

979
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,160
gradient descent

980
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
on the negative log of the steady state

981
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
density which can be interpreted as

982
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,079
self-information so how surprised should

983
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,119
one be

984
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,720
to be at a given location relative to

985
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,280
expectation so we talked about how like

986
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,000
the potential energy of the ball higher

987
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
up on the bowl is higher

988
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,119
and then the potential function drops

989
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,000
and that's the physical analogy to this

990
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,560
more informational statistical

991
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
distribution approach to

992
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,960
the self-information

993
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,839
and then in 3.1

994
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,839
that

995
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,240
self-information is going to be pursued

996
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,880
and expanded upon for

997
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
a a relatively more simple case

998
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,640
so we're going to identify due to the

999
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
helmholtz decomposition that there's

1000
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,240
this key variable which can be

1001
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,880
interpreted as like a potential function

1002
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,359
corresponding to the self-supprisal

1003
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,480
and

1004
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
that self-supprisal

1005
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,000
term

1006
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,800
may have functional forms

1007
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,480
so we can have a function

1008
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,960
that describes how surprised we should

1009
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,839
be

1010
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,320
stephen

1011
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,320
yeah if you could go to that last slide

1012
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,520
the previous one there that um

1013
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,400
i like this is quite useful so

1014
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
the the a plank if it's an

1015
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
equilibrium

1016
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,119
which we're not at because we're doing

1017
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,800
non-equilibrium steady state but if it

1018
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
were then it would be zero basically

1019
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
it's that equilibrium so it's not

1020
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
changing so

1021
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,119
there's no there's no divergence because

1022
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,680
um it's zero

1023
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,640
and then he's taking this helmet

1024
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,560
composition which in a way is like a

1025
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
vector isn't it with a vector you've got

1026
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,320
you know you can split something's

1027
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,359
moving into x and y so the this the

1028
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,680
gradient is coming out and the solenoid

1029
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,320
was at right angles to the gradient

1030
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,160
so it's kind of like that trick that he

1031
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,280
does with

1032
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,359
accuracy and complexity

1033
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,480
he can

1034
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,240
say that there's a solenoidal and

1035
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
gradient which go together

1036
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
for when it's still in a kind of a

1037
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
particular

1038
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,720
angular momentum sense

1039
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,440
and then there's that ability to

1040
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
with the housekeeping

1041
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,240
to then move it into the flow

1042
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,680
which i'm not entirely sure i think

1043
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,760
that's the bit where we might need some

1044
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
quite what because flow could probably

1045
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
be more specifically thought about

1046
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,040
so now you've got this ability to

1047
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,880
sort of sort of structure

1048
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,720
through the kind of more particular

1049
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,720
context the solenoidal and gradient

1050
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,520
and then there's this transition

1051
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,480
to a more kind of general

1052
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
variable

1053
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,680
which can be just we don't need to get

1054
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
the particulars now because it's a

1055
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,560
variational

1056
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
metric that just gets used in an

1057
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
approximation sense

1058
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
and

1059
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
then it follows into what you're saying

1060
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
would i be

1061
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
on the right tracks with that

1062
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,800
um

1063
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,440
not sure who he is even though i have an

1064
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,680
expectation because it's a multi-person

1065
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,000
paper but just looking at these as like

1066
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,079
circles and triangles and squares we can

1067
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,040
see that upside down triangle fancy i of

1068
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,680
x is in both terms so there's like a q

1069
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,760
multiplied by something and then a gamma

1070
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
multiplied by something

1071
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,760
and we see that omega

1072
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
is defined as like the q minus the gamma

1073
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,920
so these two terms which were decomposed

1074
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,760
out from each other

1075
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,280
get recombined into the final flow

1076
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
so

1077
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,640
that's just like if it were like a times

1078
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,000
x minus b times x and then omega we're

1079
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
defined as a minus b

1080
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,359
times x

1081
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,400
so we're

1082
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,319
recomposing

1083
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,359
a flow equation that still features this

1084
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,960
fancy i

1085
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,680
and yes we're solving that for

1086
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,960
a specific

1087
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
point that matters we want to solve that

1088
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
for where the ball is at the bottom of

1089
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
the bowl

1090
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
so there's

1091
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,400
a function

1092
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
that's going to tell us more or less

1093
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,240
in multiple ways

1094
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,520
whether we're

1095
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
more or less

1096
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
away from the bottom of the bowl

1097
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
and again it's not about the system

1098
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,119
being at stationarity

1099
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,720
it's about this decomposition

1100
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,319
having a focker plank steady state

1101
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,400
dean

1102
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
just one quick thing so at the bottom of

1103
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
the bowl if we the gradient can

1104
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,560
effectively be zero but solenoidal could

1105
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,480
still have a value because it can still

1106
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,920
be spinning around the bottom of the

1107
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,800
bowl but the gradient then because it i

1108
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
noticed the gradient

1109
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,760
term

1110
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,160
isn't in the flow but the solenoidal

1111
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
term is

1112
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,920
the gradient is because q minus gamma

1113
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,400
is in omega so omega is this omega

1114
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,319
del fancy i

1115
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,040
is just these two terms combined okay

1116
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,119
okay yeah dean

1117
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,839
yeah i was just going to say what

1118
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,000
typically when this is brought

1119
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,240
forward it's easier to understand the

1120
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,760
decomposition and the recompiling if we

1121
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
view the blanket as a partition where it

1122
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,240
gets a little bit more interesting is

1123
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
when the blanket is literally an

1124
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,119
envelopment

1125
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,040
and there's a there's a

1126
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,359
physicist by the name of keith humphries

1127
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,440
he talks about emergence and he looks at

1128
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,760
that piece of it as well because there's

1129
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,319
a polar aspect to this we can think of

1130
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,040
that in terms of positive and negative

1131
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,760
uh fields magnetization and stuff like

1132
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
that and

1133
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
how that is also a decomposition and a

1134
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,680
recompiling

1135
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,760
so i understand how it was presented in

1136
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,359
this paper

1137
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,680
that's the partition way of looking at

1138
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
it right it's more or less but there's

1139
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,599
also the

1140
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
positive and negative polar piece to

1141
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,839
this when we look at the markov blanket

1142
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,359
as a blanket

1143
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,839
as opposed to a separator and again if

1144
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,880
we're holding up two things at once

1145
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,480
this this doesn't

1146
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
this doesn't change that it's just

1147
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,640
making sure that we hold both things up

1148
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
at once the envelopment

1149
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
and the divider

1150
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,200
i just want to bring that out there

1151
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
because again

1152
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,560
we can we can see it easier as a

1153
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,680
partition

1154
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,599
like the skin as a partition we don't

1155
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,839
typically see the skin as a platform for

1156
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,520
sunscreen

1157
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,839
that's my point

1158
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,880
thanks dean stephen

1159
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,000
yeah

1160
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,319
this this this um this is a good point

1161
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,000
in terms of

1162
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,280
you can imagine

1163
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,720
at first i was thinking about grading

1164
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,920
you know it's obvious that you've got a

1165
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,240
gradient that you can pass through

1166
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,319
maybe where the gradient's zero but also

1167
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,480
solenoidal flow i suppose if if things

1168
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,640
are moving around this way and it starts

1169
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
to turn and it starts to go the other

1170
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
way at some point

1171
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,319
the the solenoidal flow is also passing

1172
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,520
through

1173
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,680
um a zero so they can both pass through

1174
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,319
a zero point it just wasn't as intuitive

1175
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,160
when i first thought about it

1176
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,520
yeah and even if you have something

1177
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
that's spinning around like something

1178
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,960
that's spinning in a circle like a

1179
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,880
hammer thrower it's actually continual

1180
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,560
acceleration that doesn't mean it's

1181
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
speeding up it means that the vector is

1182
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,200
continually changing

1183
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,520
so now our map

1184
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,040
is of that acceleration and it is

1185
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,920
unchanging in how it changes

1186
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,200
so that

1187
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,480
is to say that the system can have

1188
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,440
at a

1189
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,000
in a different way of thinking about it

1190
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,680
yes a solenoidal component we're not

1191
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,520
saying that balls at the bottom of bulls

1192
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,599
are dead and unmoving

1193
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,560
we're saying in our map

1194
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
there's only one point because we set it

1195
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,960
up to be like a bull map

1196
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,319
where the derivative is zero that's the

1197
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
solution where

1198
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,640
the rate of change is zero

1199
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,800
so that's not to say that the system

1200
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,839
isn't moving that's to say that the flow

1201
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,200
steady state has been achieved

1202
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
in figure four

1203
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
well in figure three

1204
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,839
we see

1205
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,079
um the three states so this is like the

1206
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,319
cover of the geb book

1207
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,160
like kind of three different projections

1208
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,480
from a three-dimensional system

1209
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,800
um the second versus the third the first

1210
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,319
versus the third and the first versus

1211
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,440
the second

1212
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,839
and we're seeing how there's

1213
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,880
movements

1214
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,359
of sampled trajectories

1215
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,319
and they're kind of coming back to

1216
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,280
something that's bowl like for any set

1217
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
of two dimensions

1218
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,880
so it's kind of like a three-dimensional

1219
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,480
bowl now

1220
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,280
because any two of these dimensions

1221
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,680
it's more like a regular

1222
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,160
bowl but the kind of soup goes in but

1223
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,119
then

1224
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,920
like the the soup bowl is like

1225
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,800
a down projection of a system that has

1226
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
an attractor in a higher dimension

1227
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,440
potentially a much higher dimension but

1228
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
lorenz they're only modeling three

1229
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,440
because the particle only moves in three

1230
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
dimensions

1231
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,280
when we continue to investigate

1232
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,920
the bowl-like properties

1233
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,720
of our laplacian approximation to that

1234
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,400
lorenz system

1235
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,160
we see that there's a few different

1236
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,119
shapes of bulls depending on which angle

1237
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,520
we're going to shine the flashlight from

1238
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,400
some of them are like spherical

1239
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,760
so a spherical bowl doesn't have any

1240
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,160
specific correlation

1241
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,200
between

1242
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,280
the two dimensions

1243
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,920
it's like a cloud of points the

1244
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,480
regression is just like flat through it

1245
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,520
however there are some

1246
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,880
couplings

1247
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,599
where the bowl is non-random so it's

1248
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,520
almost like if we were tracking the

1249
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,200
movement of a ball it's getting jostled

1250
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,520
around in these bowls well like the one

1251
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,119
of the first and third if that was the

1252
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
light we were shining it would just look

1253
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
like it was a scatter plot this is

1254
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,960
totally the regression's flat there's

1255
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,280
not much information being provided it's

1256
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,319
it's

1257
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,079
within the bowl so it already has some

1258
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,920
nice dynamics but it's kind of within

1259
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,000
that attractor zone

1260
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,400
it's a scatter there's no pattern

1261
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,760
but clearly for the first and the second

1262
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,079
we see that there is a coupling now

1263
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,359
imagine if we didn't see the bull

1264
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,880
because of course we don't it's not

1265
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
there that's part of our map we're just

1266
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,880
seeing the movement of that ball as we

1267
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,560
sample it through time

1268
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,839
and it would be only on this manifold

1269
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,480
kind of being like spending more time

1270
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,240
going from the top left to the bottom

1271
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,560
right in these images

1272
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,119
so we're going to take that idea

1273
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,160
and then connect it to the jacobian and

1274
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,280
the hessian

1275
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,880
which is again

1276
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,440
throwback to our matrix math slide and

1277
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,760
um an awesome opportunity for anyone who

1278
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,599
wants to bring more of a technical

1279
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,680
interpretation to the stream

1280
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,119
the jacobian

1281
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,240
is like

1282
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,960
the

1283
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,160
first

1284
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,480
the the unnamed matrix is just like the

1285
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,319
matrix of position

1286
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,520
so that's like

1287
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,079
the first moment of the distribution

1288
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,480
and then higher moments are like the

1289
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,559
partial derivatives so jacobian is like

1290
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,800
the first order partial derivative so

1291
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,280
that's like the slope of the ruler at

1292
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,440
that point and then the hessian is the

1293
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
second partial derivative that's like

1294
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,640
the curvature so if it's a bowl there's

1295
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,960
only one point where it's flat

1296
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
and then it could be flat and the bowl

1297
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,720
could be like up or the bowl could be

1298
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
upside down and so that's why it's

1299
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
important to also have this second

1300
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,720
curvature term to understand whether

1301
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,319
we're at a bowl like this or a bowl like

1302
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,079
that so that's kind of like calculus

1303
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,160
and

1304
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
those

1305
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,400
bowls those bowl attractor shapes which

1306
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
we're inferring using the laplacian

1307
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,640
quadratic assumption so it's not saying

1308
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,119
that the lorenz has these possesses

1309
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,960
these is these it's saying that's the

1310
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,559
approximation that we're going to make

1311
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,559
it turns out that although there is

1312
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,440
somewhat of an unclear

1313
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,520
correlation pattern in the first

1314
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,800
derivatives

1315
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,240
so like the movement to the left it's

1316
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,839
not like it's correlated with movement

1317
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:40,720
up

1318
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,839
however

1319
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,400
the second

1320
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,040
partial derivative the hessian matrix

1321
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,400
starts to look

1322
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,520
a lot like the covariance matrix

1323
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,480
so the actual positional covariance

1324
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,720
of these states with each other so like

1325
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,559
the on diagonal is kind of obvious like

1326
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,040
of course your position on the x-axis is

1327
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,559
correlated well with your position on

1328
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,079
the x-axis

1329
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:04,880
but

1330
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,160
there are

1331
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,440
correlations between state one and two

1332
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,480
and

1333
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,839
that is recapitulated in the structure

1334
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,520
of the second order polynomial

1335
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,640
approximation to these attractors that

1336
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,720
are laplacian approximations

1337
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,520
so

1338
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,359
again up until that point in 3.5

1339
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,000
and in figure 6

1340
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,280
markov has not been introduced

1341
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,440
nothing has been said

1342
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
that word hasn't come into play it

1343
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,839
didn't come into the system's definition

1344
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,000
and so that's just really important

1345
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,240
because it's just showing like

1346
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,119
there's a lot of groundwork to get to

1347
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,160
where we make the markovian partitioning

1348
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,559
and so

1349
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,520
there's

1350
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,680
power and challenge in that stephen

1351
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,599
would i be correct in saying that

1352
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,520
effectively it's a it's a case of

1353
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,680
approximating

1354
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,919
the

1355
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,319
states

1356
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,200
of the lorenz attractor

1357
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,800
and that's what's that's currently there

1358
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,640
so this is different ways of

1359
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,040
showing that within some manifold state

1360
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,160
space

1361
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,440
and

1362
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,880
by approaching it in different ways it

1363
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,480
reveals a different type of

1364
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,640
approximation the only thing i would ask

1365
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
i'm a little bit confused why it does

1366
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,640
squish maybe i'm missing something i can

1367
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,000
see why

1368
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,520
there'd be kind of a round one

1369
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,040
i'm just trying to work out how it

1370
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,800
squishes is it something to do because

1371
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,880
of the solenoidal piece or the gradient

1372
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,280
piece or is that something else

1373
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,400
okay

1374
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,200
so

1375
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,280
if we were talking about

1376
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,079
just a particle undergoing brownian

1377
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,040
diffusion in three dimensions

1378
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,839
so

1379
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,040
it doesn't have any kind of correlations

1380
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,640
or any sort of structure just it's just

1381
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,960
a random walk in three dimensions well

1382
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,200
then it would have a spherical error

1383
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,920
profile for all of these images

1384
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,960
but

1385
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,559
we are capturing structure that exists

1386
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,359
because lorenz attractor has a specific

1387
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,800
specification

1388
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,359
so the states are whichever are being

1389
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,960
modeled if you cared about pressure and

1390
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,359
volume that's your state space that

1391
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,000
two-dimensional state space of the map

1392
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,119
it's not saying those are the only

1393
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
states of that system it's just those

1394
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
are the ones that you're modeling

1395
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,040
in the lorenz system

1396
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,800
we have three states

1397
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,680
it's positioned in three dimensions

1398
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,200
but those three dimensions again also

1399
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,839
apply to a brownian diffusing particle

1400
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,079
which has a different

1401
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,800
jacobian covariance and hessian

1402
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,720
we're talking about those being

1403
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,559
calculated for

1404
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,880
the lorenz system with the parameters

1405
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,960
that they selected

1406
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,559
and so we are pulling out

1407
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
covariances

1408
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
and connecting it to this second order

1409
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,520
polynomial approximation in the hessian

1410
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,040
for a system

1411
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,720
where the movement

1412
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,440
is not just a brownian diffusion and so

1413
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,040
that's why there's structure in the

1414
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,440
covariance and that's why the structure

1415
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,280
is interestingly recapitulated in the

1416
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,839
hessian dean

1417
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,280
and all i would

1418
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
all i would supplement that with is

1419
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,000
things things

1420
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,160
there we go things that are

1421
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,040
in

1422
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,240
something

1423
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,680
that's moving

1424
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,040
the thing that's moving that's in

1425
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,400
something that's moving that's on

1426
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,559
something that's moving has a tendency

1427
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,599
to have

1428
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:36,880
the

1429
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,200
negative charge things all congregate in

1430
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,079
one place down in the lower right corner

1431
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,920
and all the positive things all

1432
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,119
congregate in another place in the upper

1433
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,359
left corner that's the nature of

1434
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,559
movement

1435
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,520
and so

1436
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,920
that polar part of it is in play as well

1437
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,440
if we

1438
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,520
consider it as part of these statistical

1439
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,599
transitions and that's

1440
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,960
again again

1441
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,559
it's it

1442
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,720
it's fascinating if you if you look at

1443
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,760
it a minimum of two things so not just

1444
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,400
not just as a partition but also as a an

1445
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,680
an envelope those things suddenly

1446
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,520
pop out at you and you see the pattern

1447
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,920
in in a different way

1448
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,520
so i want to think about a physical

1449
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,440
system that's not chaotic but will help

1450
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,960
us understand what this covariance

1451
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
matrix is so let's think about a

1452
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,440
children's carousel

1453
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,760
so it moves the horsey is moving around

1454
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,599
in a circle and so that's like our unit

1455
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,520
circle like the four quadrants and then

1456
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,920
also the horsey is going up and down

1457
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,640
okay so when you're

1458
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,079
you know so again it's like you know if

1459
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,480
you're at 12 o'clock on the carousel

1460
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,880
it's like you have a one for the y and a

1461
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
zero for x okay so i hope that makes

1462
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,599
sense now as it goes around it's like .5

1463
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,319
and 0.5 again just using simple numbers

1464
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,680
here like the x and the y are correlated

1465
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,680
and then they're also correlated here so

1466
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,280
one could say that there's like a

1467
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,920
correlation between the x and the y like

1468
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,480
they have a covariance together

1469
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,440
but now the z-axis is moving up and down

1470
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,400
independently so a system like that

1471
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,599
you'd see

1472
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,440
a covariance between the x and the y

1473
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,680
positions of the horsey

1474
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,960
and

1475
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,680
not that they're a different system

1476
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,839
but that they are

1477
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,599
uncorrelated they don't provide mutual

1478
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,760
information on the z-axis which is

1479
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,839
oscillating now

1480
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,720
if this paper had done we model a

1481
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,960
deterministic carousel

1482
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
and it's kind of like putting the rabbit

1483
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,440
in the hat because the covariance

1484
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,240
matrix it looking like this

1485
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,839
would be no surprise because it would

1486
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,400
have been defined that way so that's the

1487
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,160
key insight and one of the key

1488
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,920
contributions is like

1489
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,319
they didn't put this in the hat

1490
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,160
this is

1491
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,960
the og complex system

1492
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,240
yet

1493
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,079
the approximation

1494
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,640
the laplacian approximation

1495
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,160
pulls out a covariance structure

1496
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,880
that's extremely tractable

1497
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,160
and

1498
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,240
it turns out that it still has a very

1499
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,640
strongly positive and very similar

1500
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,559
leopard if exponent

1501
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,160
so it's like now it's like a chaotic

1502
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,760
carousel

1503
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,400
and yet our approximation our map of

1504
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,119
that chaotic carousel

1505
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,839
still holds the chaotic nature of the

1506
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,040
system

1507
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,760
while also giving these bowl like

1508
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,119
attractors

1509
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,839
for any given two and even all

1510
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,359
dimensions or states considered

1511
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,720
simultaneously

1512
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,839
so

1513
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,880
um

1514
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,599
we're not conflating the simplicity of a

1515
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,680
non-equilibrium steady state with the

1516
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,760
complexity of the underlying density

1517
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,880
dynamics

1518
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,599
so just because the map is simple

1519
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,599
doesn't mean that the territory is and

1520
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,040
so that to me is a knockout blow

1521
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,640
against realism and for instrumentalism

1522
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,799
because this paper's saying nothing

1523
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,640
about the underlying system

1524
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,559
active doesn't say anything about the

1525
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,559
underlying system we're talking about

1526
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,960
approximations and our maps of

1527
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,319
territories

1528
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,839
in other words

1529
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,720
the probability density can evolve in a

1530
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,040
complicated fashion

1531
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,000
in attractors

1532
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,000
go ahead stephen

1533
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,359
and

1534
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,559
from what you're saying it's like if i

1535
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,400
was to take that lorenzo tractor which

1536
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,520
isn't

1537
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,040
it's like a saddle often people often

1538
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,839
talk about a saddle and you took the

1539
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,799
the most um

1540
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,240
agreeable

1541
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,520
way of viewing it so you view it in in a

1542
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,920
box space this way and look for how it's

1543
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,160
moving that way and then flip the box

1544
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,000
like this and see how it's moving that

1545
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,160
way and flip the box like this and see

1546
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,839
if it's working that way

1547
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,599
those approximations would be those

1548
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,200
three different distributions however if

1549
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,720
you'd moved it by

1550
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,119
like one degree

1551
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,200
that that would be like

1552
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
messy right so it's like they

1553
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,760
if you look it's almost like this is how

1554
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,440
the lorenz

1555
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,720
attractor

1556
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,480
taking the most um optimal

1557
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,200
view of xyz

1558
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,839
can be mapped out as it transgresses

1559
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,760
through the saddle

1560
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,839
um if that makes sense to bring it into

1561
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,920
a physical space

1562
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,559
um but again it's more complex than that

1563
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,359
because this is taking it where there's

1564
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,440
the plank is zero

1565
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,359
to try and get

1566
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,359
the most optimum sort of that's why

1567
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,200
those things are

1568
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,559
follow a nice

1569
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,319
stable

1570
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,920
transition whereas if you're taking a

1571
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,799
sort of

1572
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,720
an odd angle

1573
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,440
it might all be completely a mess

1574
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,960
would that be a fair

1575
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,599
way of saying it

1576
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,839
if you were to take a perspective a

1577
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,480
projection down

1578
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,240
that was a mixture of other

1579
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,559
axes then

1580
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,680
not sure what is gained by that but i i

1581
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,040
see what you're saying there's some

1582
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,559
particle moving in three dimensions and

1583
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,799
you can have a projection into any side

1584
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,440
of that cube or you could take some sort

1585
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,040
of off kilter view that would be still

1586
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,799
some type of linear

1587
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,640
summation of all three so it hasn't

1588
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,400
really reduced the challenge of

1589
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,960
estimating but yes i mean that's one way

1590
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,319
to see it dean

1591
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,760
so i'm in complete agreement it has to

1592
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,680
be instrumental

1593
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,160
so that you can compare to the real so

1594
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,720
the minimum of two you have to have

1595
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,880
multiple maths not one

1596
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,799
in order to be able to see this

1597
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,280
and that basically then reinforces the

1598
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,599
idea that the markov blanket has to both

1599
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,240
at the same time be a partition

1600
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,960
and be an envelope it's both at the same

1601
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,359
time a minimum of two again

1602
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,000
so again all we keep reinforcing is this

1603
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,720
is this idea that if we over reduce if

1604
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,680
we get if we get to a place of under two

1605
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,960
we may be deceiving ourselves

1606
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,720
and i think we'll come back to that soon

1607
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,240
so now

1608
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,640
one hour in

1609
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,559
we're able to get to the markov blankets

1610
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:27,599
okay

1611
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,640
so

1612
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,839
previously

1613
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,440
we were talking about the case of a

1614
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,760
single markov blanket and so if we

1615
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,440
thought about like a bayesian graph so

1616
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,960
now we're thinking about

1617
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,280
three nodes each corresponding to the x

1618
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,920
y and z axis

1619
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,000
nodes a and b you know the first two

1620
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,839
axes would have like an edge between

1621
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,480
them because they have some type of

1622
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,799
statistical relationship

1623
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,440
and then it would be disconnected from

1624
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,119
the third node because it doesn't have a

1625
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,359
statistical relationship with them

1626
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,240
okay

1627
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,400
so now

1628
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,920
to actually

1629
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,640
start to get towards more like the

1630
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,040
communicating systems or

1631
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,280
system in the niche

1632
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,880
that we're interested in that's the

1633
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,000
target that we're trying to aim towards

1634
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,599
in section four

1635
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,760
the authors repeat the analysis of the

1636
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,200
previous section

1637
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,920
but approximate two lorenz systems that

1638
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,359
are coupled to each other through their

1639
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,599
respective first states

1640
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,599
okay so we're going to look at this

1641
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,839
matrix

1642
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,960
okay so notice that there are two

1643
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,400
this

1644
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,079
make that transparent

1645
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,000
so here's one

1646
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,960
lorenz system

1647
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,520
here's the other lorenz system

1648
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,640
the the red one and the blue one

1649
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
and then

1650
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,160
there in these other

1651
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,200
cells

1652
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,160
these are the coupling terms

1653
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,040
so

1654
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,240
these are

1655
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,880
couples this is saying that the first

1656
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,319
state of each

1657
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,319
are coupled so it's a bi-directional

1658
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,359
coupling

1659
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,040
and that it's saying like state one the

1660
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,440
fourth state on the matrix like matrix

1661
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,280
row and column four

1662
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,440
is the first state of the blue system so

1663
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,440
the first state of the blue one the top

1664
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,599
left of the blue and the top left of the

1665
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,480
red

1666
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,160
are coupled through the off diagonal

1667
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,200
green

1668
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
boxed terms

1669
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,440
if this was all zeros nine zeros here

1670
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,040
and nine zeros here

1671
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,160
we would have

1672
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,200
two

1673
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,480
independently evolving lorenz systems so

1674
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,960
we kind of took the lorenz system

1675
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,880
the three by three matrix that specified

1676
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,760
the dynamics of that system

1677
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,079
and then we just made another

1678
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,640
now a nine a six by six matrix

1679
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,119
with two lorenz systems that would be

1680
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,559
evolving

1681
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,039
statistically independently

1682
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,000
unless we introduce this targeted

1683
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,920
coupling

1684
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,520
and they say this form of coupling was

1685
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
chosen to be as simple and symmetric as

1686
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,640
possible

1687
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,440
okay

1688
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,920
so this is like the next

1689
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,200
step

1690
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,839
but it's a difference that makes a

1691
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:12,799
difference

1692
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,480
because this is going to change the

1693
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,039
total dynamics of it if you had just the

1694
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,720
red and just the blue

1695
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,280
you could like split that matrix

1696
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,880
and you'd be getting the exact same

1697
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,640
model ability because the systems

1698
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,400
wouldn't be interacting

1699
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,280
but now we've introduced these terms

1700
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,280
even if we only had one

1701
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,839
where you can no

1702
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,400
longer divide this matrix into sub

1703
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,480
matrices that perfectly describe the

1704
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,359
time evolution of the system

1705
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,079
so 7 figure 7

1706
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,720
is like figure 3

1707
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,400
so it's similar we're taking like sort

1708
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,839
of pinpoint

1709
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,920
locations on

1710
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
the laplacian approximation of the

1711
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,440
lorenz system

1712
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,760
and now seven is doing the same

1713
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,079
but it's looking at these two

1714
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,720
synchronized systems or maybe it's

1715
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,240
better to say that

1716
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
there's two

1717
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,920
coupled systems

1718
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,079
entangled do yes and due to the

1719
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,079
structure of their coupling

1720
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,079
it results in an entangled movement

1721
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,520
pattern

1722
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,599
such that their trajectories have very

1723
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:17,870
um

1724
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:20,319
[Music]

1725
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,160
have their trajectories are informative

1726
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,839
of each other

1727
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,599
and that's also reflected by this flow

1728
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,559
diagram where clearly

1729
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,559
their

1730
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,760
movements

1731
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,319
exist on a manifold

1732
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,720
that's in a restricted space of the

1733
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,119
possible so two people brownie and

1734
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,119
diffusing in two separate rooms you'd

1735
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,119
get that circle

1736
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,400
scatter plot

1737
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,319
okay two people who are tied to each

1738
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,119
other

1739
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,359
you would see a perfect correlation and

1740
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,119
so we're seeing something even though

1741
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,400
each system has complex and even chaotic

1742
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,960
endogenous dynamics we're seeing that

1743
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,559
the introduction

1744
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,039
of this coupling term

1745
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,319
allows the systems to actually

1746
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,760
empirically

1747
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,920
have

1748
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,839
entangled behavior steven

1749
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,760
we've now got lorenz systems as opposed

1750
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,440
to an attractor

1751
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,280
and i'm curious when does it go from an

1752
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
attractor

1753
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,440
to a system

1754
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,280
is it because is that does the coupling

1755
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,160
effectively start to create

1756
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,640
more systemic

1757
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,799
nature or you know i'm just curious

1758
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,240
about that

1759
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,440
is it because it's the

1760
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,079
systems the lorenz system is just these

1761
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,520
three this is the specification of a

1762
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,839
lorenz system and it has an it's a

1763
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,760
chaotic attractor and so now we're

1764
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,000
talking about two of them

1765
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,520
so there's two coupled lorenz systems

1766
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,359
but it doesn't make sense to talk about

1767
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,359
two coupled attractors because that's

1768
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,960
not what's coupled the systems are

1769
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,760
coupled as per the matrix specification

1770
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,799
and then it doesn't even make sense to

1771
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,359
couple the attractors the whole point is

1772
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,440
there is an attractor now

1773
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,520
by virtue of the coupling of the lorenz

1774
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,280
systems

1775
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,119
is it almost like once you start to have

1776
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,400
something and you're going to relate

1777
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,680
them

1778
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,359
as soon as things relate there's a

1779
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,480
system

1780
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,559
because there's a relational quality to

1781
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:19,440
it

1782
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,119
whereas previously it could be a

1783
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,880
mathematical for

1784
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,799
formalism it was still described as

1785
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,720
lorenz system so i wouldn't get too

1786
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,440
hung up on that word but yes systems

1787
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,799
have multiple interacting parts

1788
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,400
okay

1789
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,039
figure eight just like seven

1790
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,839
revisited the format of three

1791
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,720
eight is going to revisit four

1792
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,599
and

1793
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,200
now we're going to get to where we start

1794
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,039
to see the partitioning

1795
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,480
figure eight's gonna revisit four so

1796
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,160
remember the first partial derivative

1797
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,599
the second partial derivative in the

1798
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,440
jacobian and the hessian respectively

1799
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,359
and then the covariance so we're gonna

1800
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,200
do that same thing that we did on a

1801
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,480
three by three

1802
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,400
but now we're gonna do it on a six by

1803
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,599
six

1804
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,960
the log jacobian looks a lot

1805
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,319
like

1806
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,200
this

1807
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,760
the non-zero cells in the specification

1808
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,280
of the system

1809
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,240
which

1810
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,480
is the system itself for systems that we

1811
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,160
get to specify

1812
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,480
it looks a lot like this but again for

1813
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,960
territories we don't get to specify

1814
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,039
the map looking like this

1815
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,359
does not say something specific about

1816
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,640
the territory

1817
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,240
but it's not super surprising that um we

1818
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,760
actually see

1819
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,400
like similar this top right has

1820
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,960
like no correlation like one and three

1821
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,039
are not correlated and we see that

1822
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,839
little chip missing here and here

1823
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,280
so we see

1824
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,160
a lot of the same dynamics at play

1825
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,000
within each of the coupled lorenz

1826
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,039
systems

1827
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,280
but also we've introduced

1828
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,960
a coupling

1829
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,880
now that coupling

1830
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,680
induces a new and different covariant

1831
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,799
structure

1832
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,680
look at these gray squares in the off

1833
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,960
diagonals

1834
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,680
now one and two of system a

1835
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,520
are coupled to one and two of system b

1836
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,920
less so a little bit grayer

1837
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,680
than the one

1838
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,160
that are within each system

1839
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,200
but still very marked bi-directional

1840
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,520
synchrony is being induced

1841
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,200
the interesting piece comes into play

1842
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,920
when we look at this second order

1843
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
approximation

1844
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,039
and that's where we see that several

1845
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,760
cells can be identified so here we have

1846
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,079
like the magenta mute please stephen

1847
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,960
thank you the magenta and the red

1848
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,480
are those first states of system a and b

1849
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,839
those are the ones that have the

1850
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,960
coupling on the fourth okay

1851
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,680
then you have the other two states of

1852
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,559
system a in teal and the other two

1853
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,480
states of system b

1854
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,359
in dark blue so it's almost like we have

1855
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,280
four kinds of

1856
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,400
states

1857
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,319
four kinds of states out of these six of

1858
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,000
course you could say well each each

1859
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,359
state is unique

1860
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,359
great totally true they're different

1861
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,480
states that's why we have them as

1862
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,440
different dimensions in our model but

1863
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,359
there's going to be some interesting

1864
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,119
things that fall out

1865
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,520
as a function of us separating out the

1866
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,960
two systems

1867
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,040
and then separating out parts of the

1868
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,799
system that interface internally and

1869
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,359
externally and then parts of the system

1870
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,640
that do not

1871
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,839
directly by virtue of how we know we

1872
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,080
specified the system

1873
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,719
do not couple out

1874
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,960
again the fascinating thing

1875
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,040
is that like state two

1876
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,399
of system a

1877
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,520
and state two of system b

1878
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,158
have a covariance

1879
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,198
that's like

1880
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,600
maybe a mirror neuron again using a more

1881
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,198
like realistic mapping it's like there's

1882
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,880
some internal part

1883
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,479
that is only interacting with other

1884
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,000
internal parts by virtue of how the

1885
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,600
system is defined

1886
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,399
and yet these two parts in each system

1887
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,040
which are not directly interacting

1888
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,520
by virtue of how we set up a system

1889
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,479
have

1890
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,080
covariance

1891
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,880
so

1892
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,839
that

1893
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,040
is what leads us to this

1894
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,040
numerical analysis

1895
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,279
which kind of

1896
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,040
provides a little bit stronger and

1897
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,359
different empirical evidence so it's not

1898
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,000
just an analytical

1899
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,759
formulation it's um

1900
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,238
a numerical simulation

1901
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,198
where

1902
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,198
we can see that when we actually let

1903
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,520
that system play out

1904
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,198
that even when

1905
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,238
states

1906
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,560
start very correlated

1907
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,080
like we just start the third and the

1908
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,560
sixth state in a very similar position

1909
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,000
so they start out with a high partial

1910
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,238
correlation coefficient

1911
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,920
when we run out that simulation through

1912
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,120
time

1913
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,600
it ends up trending towards zero partial

1914
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,960
correlation

1915
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,280
so we're recapitulating

1916
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,400
the correlation patterns

1917
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,520
of

1918
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,800
the system

1919
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
even when it starts

1920
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,080
in a more

1921
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,480
correlated place

1922
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,080
and so that suggests that some very

1923
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
essential

1924
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,159
aspects of the system

1925
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:17,360
are being isolated and tractably handled

1926
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,000
by this kind of partitioning of coupled

1927
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,400
systems

1928
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,679
so it's pretty interesting

1929
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,480
now we've seen this top oh dean yes and

1930
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,880
then we'll just grow quickly danny what

1931
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,040
it also says is that hype

1932
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,640
hyperbolic

1933
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,199
is also existing in this pattern

1934
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,719
although it's not necessarily being

1935
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,560
materialized in these diagrams it's it's

1936
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,400
also there i mean what that's what this

1937
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,040
explains is that there can be continuity

1938
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,760
there can be alignment and there can be

1939
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,440
the hyperbolic

1940
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,040
function within

1941
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,800
all at the same time again that's i just

1942
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,280
wanna again i just want to point to the

1943
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,199
non-obvious but it's still there

1944
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,239
great

1945
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,799
so we've seen this top of steven yes

1946
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,239
yeah it's also going to add that so by

1947
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,560
showing the nature of the coupling like

1948
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,159
varying the nature of the coupling that

1949
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,280
you showed

1950
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,719
it's sort of reached it can reach a

1951
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,320
different sort of

1952
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,280
state

1953
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,440
non-equilibrium steady state in some

1954
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,199
ways would that be true

1955
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,920
there's a different pattern emerges as

1956
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,960
so

1957
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,400
it could speak

1958
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,800
maybe i'm over extending this but

1959
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,679
changing the nature of how things couple

1960
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,800
could in a way change the sort of states

1961
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
which things can fall into so use you

1962
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,280
could almost have multiple states

1963
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,360
being inferred based on how the coupling

1964
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,719
is

1965
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,199
set up oh yes i mean we would throw out

1966
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:54,080
any model that treated two people tied

1967
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,400
to each other as simply moving the same

1968
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,120
way as two people in different rooms it

1969
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,920
is the coupling of systems

1970
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,520
that

1971
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,280
influence their behavior

1972
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,640
and again we're not talking about the

1973
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,000
causal structure of the world territory

1974
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,760
we're talking about the models that we

1975
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,280
got to specify

1976
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,400
and how changing the coupling pattern

1977
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,320
changes their behavior

1978
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,679
dean

1979
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,760
yeah and stephen when you're taking the

1980
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,480
abstraction here off the page

1981
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,320
so you could set up your programming for

1982
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,800
example that says okay

1983
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,280
i'm willing to sponsor somebody

1984
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,080
because i want to mentor them in

1985
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,199
bricklaying you can start with that

1986
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,040
or you can start with

1987
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,880
there's two people that are interested

1988
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,400
in brickling but the first thing we have

1989
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,239
to address is whether there's a

1990
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,159
potential for positive entanglement

1991
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,560
that in real terms that's how you can

1992
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,840
flip the

1993
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,360
the abstraction

1994
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,719
into the

1995
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,159
the likelihood

1996
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,760
of those

1997
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,719
entanglements turning out

1998
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,480
extending because the people will

1999
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,679
actually be relatable to one another

2000
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,840
so that i'm just again i'll bring that

2001
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,760
up because

2002
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,520
that's how we turn the abstraction into

2003
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,320
the

2004
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,640
so what does that look like

2005
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,080
okay stephen something quick on this

2006
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,760
otherwise we'll get to 10. oh yeah just

2007
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,159
very quickly yeah so that that speaks to

2008
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,000
because we often think about the

2009
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,880
the

2010
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,560
the model on the inside the generative

2011
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,719
model and the external states and

2012
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,280
you know the model trying to understand

2013
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,960
what the external states are doing but

2014
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,040
this speaks to

2015
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,560
the ability to

2016
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,760
to change the way the blanket

2017
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,239
is coupling so that you know how much

2018
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:41,920
work is going on

2019
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,440
in terms of

2020
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,239
enabling there to be information

2021
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,159
variational free energy information

2022
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,840
being used in the generative models how

2023
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,440
much is being done by actually changing

2024
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,719
coupling

2025
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,280
dynamics in the blanket

2026
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,360
is that make is even feasible that you

2027
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,960
know because that in itself will start

2028
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,440
to yield more and more ways for the

2029
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,679
generative model to start to extract and

2030
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,840
make inferences based on

2031
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,159
what's going on externally so that that

2032
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,520
also helps i think so as a heuristic fat

2033
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,480
pump yes great but actually the blanket

2034
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,040
is downstream of the coupling pattern so

2035
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,719
it's like changing the coupling of a

2036
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,880
blanket is a little bit of a cart before

2037
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,640
the horse because there is the coupling

2038
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,159
of the system and that is what induces

2039
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,760
partitionings

2040
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,080
which we can then map to markovian

2041
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,800
assumptions so it's like you know

2042
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,239
when you put on headphones and you're

2043
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,000
listening to this

2044
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,360
yes a different blanket is in play

2045
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,080
because the partitioning is different

2046
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,520
because the coupling is different

2047
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,360
between

2048
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,040
other states in the world

2049
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,280
dean on this and then let's go to 10.

2050
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,280
yeah i'll be real quick so

2051
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,679
like purses at charles sanders versus

2052
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,120
abduction

2053
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,120
doesn't guarantee that when you walk in

2054
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,520
later and see beans in one hand and a

2055
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,520
bag of beans in the other that you'll

2056
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,920
get to

2057
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,520
okay i just lost dean so i'm going to

2058
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,880
continue

2059
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,840
so

2060
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,600
in figure 10

2061
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,360
but he was talking about abduction and

2062
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,280
c.s pierce

2063
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,600
kind of that flipping that i understand

2064
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,679
you're right it is the card ahead of the

2065
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:22,640
horse

2066
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,040
and sometimes that helps

2067
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,560
not saying it's you and i know you're

2068
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,320
you're agreeing with me but all i'm

2069
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,560
saying is we shouldn't just assume

2070
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,960
that it only goes one way

2071
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,880
horse first card second

2072
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,000
yes and in fact partitioning differ

2073
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,440
imagining

2074
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,320
differences ways it could be different

2075
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,040
absolutely this is how we

2076
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,679
are going to apply and ask what is if

2077
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:48,640
for

2078
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,719
active inference like what is

2079
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,719
is like what is

2080
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,640
the blanket states given a coupling

2081
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,199
pattern well there's an answer

2082
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,640
sensory states are the ones with

2083
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,960
incoming statistical dependencies and

2084
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,800
active states are the ones with outgoing

2085
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,480
statistical dependencies those are the

2086
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,440
blanket states what if

2087
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,199
the coupling were different

2088
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,239
then

2089
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,640
what would the blanket be

2090
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,199
so yeah it's not that that first blanket

2091
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,040
that you identified is being changed

2092
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,960
what's being changed is the coupling

2093
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,480
which induces a different kind of

2094
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,800
covariance amongst the states but it can

2095
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,360
be almost thought of

2096
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
in a cart before the horse way so just

2097
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,520
to recap this nomenclature which we've

2098
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,120
seen before

2099
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,280
so we have external states sensory

2100
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,600
states active states and internal states

2101
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,800
b is the set of blanket states so this

2102
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,120
is one of the innovations of fristen at

2103
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,800
all beyond pearl 1988 beyond markov at

2104
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,280
all earlier earlier earlier is that

2105
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,719
blanket states

2106
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,440
which in the

2107
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,000
non-fep active world are the set of

2108
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,840
states upon which

2109
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,920
conditionally internal and external

2110
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,920
states are independent

2111
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,199
those blanket states again we're going

2112
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,719
to partition them into incoming and

2113
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,800
outgoing statistical dependencies sense

2114
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,000
and action

2115
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,360
now we have autonomous states alpha

2116
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,360
which is the set of

2117
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,679
active states and internal states

2118
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,840
autonomous states are the ones that for

2119
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,640
systems that we design we get to control

2120
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,480
we get to control our internal states we

2121
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
get to control our actions

2122
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,280
we don't get to control directly the

2123
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,800
sensory input

2124
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,040
you can close your eyes

2125
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,480
so that it's darker

2126
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,400
or you can move your head so it looks

2127
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,400
differently and maybe you'll even be

2128
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,800
right about what sensory information

2129
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,480
comes in then

2130
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,640
but you can't just say

2131
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,719
i want different sensory information

2132
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,640
coming in so those are the autonomous

2133
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,600
states

2134
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,560
and then

2135
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,800
there's the particular states

2136
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
the particular states

2137
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,239
are the whole

2138
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,640
particle that's the blanket states which

2139
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,280
are sense in action and internal states

2140
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,400
so the particular states are like the

2141
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,000
whole particle floating around in the

2142
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,400
room or the whole cell or whatever again

2143
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400
to give physical interpretations

2144
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,480
and then the autonomous ones are like

2145
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,880
the things that the cell can control

2146
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,640
or the thing that the system designer

2147
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,199
can control so we have autonomous states

2148
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,199
which composed of internal and

2149
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,679
action states blanket states action and

2150
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,239
sense particular all three on the right

2151
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,719
side and these are all being defined as

2152
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,760
a partitioning a cleaving apart from

2153
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,199
external states as modeled not of the

2154
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:36,159
territory of the map only stephen

2155
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,840
and as we uh mentioned here this this

2156
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,520
this paper gives a way for this to

2157
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,080
emerge from the very most basic

2158
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,679
principles and then we have like you

2159
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,360
described the

2160
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,880
the blanket states your autonomous

2161
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,159
states but of course in um

2162
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,080
any sort of system organism

2163
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,360
non-equilibrium steady state they're

2164
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,080
always a nested so it's not like

2165
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,760
the the the

2166
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,199
there will be

2167
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,679
a whole nested levels of markovian

2168
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:06,880
blankets

2169
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,120
so these when we emerge

2170
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,199
at higher levels

2171
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,199
we might be emerging

2172
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,320
it's not like

2173
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,080
unless we made our blanket there'd be no

2174
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,440
blanket

2175
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,440
there's going to be blankets all the way

2176
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,640
up and down

2177
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,840
so as a blanket starts to be formed or

2178
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
brought into play

2179
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,360
then

2180
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,400
the

2181
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,600
the nature of how that um those blankets

2182
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,120
come into play

2183
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,640
um

2184
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,840
starts to draw in the idea of coupling

2185
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,080
you know so maybe there's there's some

2186
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,440
of those things that you just mentioned

2187
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,560
there about

2188
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,800
um

2189
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,960
there's not a dependency the fact that

2190
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,320
we're creating something from first

2191
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,600
principles doesn't mean in the real

2192
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,560
world

2193
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,480
without the first principles we can't

2194
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,800
make a blanket

2195
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,640
because in in other cases it's going to

2196
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,320
be sort of emerging through more

2197
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,640
coupling between blankets because i

2198
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,560
noticed we're talking about the blanket

2199
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,120
but it's also good about the blanket in

2200
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,719
this scale

2201
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,840
and then the blankets in plural

2202
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,400
at the multi-scale

2203
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,759
okay yeah so within

2204
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,440
internal states

2205
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,199
again these are statistical dependencies

2206
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,040
so this one can have other things

2207
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,600
happening it's like a black box within

2208
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,719
each one

2209
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,840
and so

2210
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,560
that is um for people who expect

2211
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,760
to see the mechanics of the system

2212
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,360
that's a disappointment

2213
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,199
but for people who want to model real

2214
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,440
systems including machines

2215
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,600
it's a huge advantage because it allows

2216
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,120
us to go in

2217
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,679
keeping the map territory distinction

2218
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,199
totally apparent

2219
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,199
which is the real transparency we need

2220
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,880
from our machine learning models you

2221
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,760
know there's not going to be a

2222
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,760
transparent explanation for how 500

2223
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,360
variables interact

2224
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,199
but we can transparently see potentially

2225
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,880
how the map and the territory are

2226
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,639
distinguished

2227
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,480
now that's where we get to their

2228
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,040
definition of markov blankets

2229
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,080
so

2230
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,440
let others

2231
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,199
read through and work through the math

2232
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,920
and critique it and build on it

2233
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,880
but

2234
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,600
we're talking about boundaries

2235
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,199
based upon

2236
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,960
sub matrices

2237
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,080
of the total state space of the system

2238
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,719
so like this is just two coupled systems

2239
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,159
that we're talking about here where we

2240
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,360
were studying like system a and system b

2241
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,560
each is lorenz we we added the coupling

2242
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,159
to one and four

2243
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,040
and that's where we saw

2244
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,800
a new pattern arising

2245
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,080
why does a particular partition comprise

2246
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,080
four sets of states

2247
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,920
is it because tetrahedra are the minimum

2248
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,000
polyhedra in our world

2249
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,840
in other words why does a particular

2250
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,440
partition consider two markov boundaries

2251
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,600
the reason is that the particular

2252
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,280
partition

2253
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,080
again particular states blanket and

2254
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,600
internal

2255
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,480
the particular partition is the minimal

2256
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,400
partition that allows for directed

2257
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,440
coupling with blanket states

2258
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,040
sensory states can influence internal

2259
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,600
states incoming dependencies

2260
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,520
and active states can influence external

2261
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,560
states

2262
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,320
outgoing dependencies

2263
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,320
without destroying the conditional

2264
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,320
independencies of the particular

2265
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,000
partition

2266
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,120
as shown in the upper figure upper panel

2267
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,120
of figure 10.

2268
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,480
so

2269
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,239
very cool

2270
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:37,920
how we went from one coupled system or

2271
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,480
from one system with chaotic dynamics

2272
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,159
made an approximation

2273
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,760
and then showed that it had certain

2274
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,000
well-behaved aspects and then we took

2275
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,880
like the next step up which is to couple

2276
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,600
systems in a way that we designed

2277
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,960
and that

2278
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,960
gave a new

2279
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,239
manifold

2280
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,040
that the systems were

2281
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,080
acting entangled as if within

2282
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,199
and then

2283
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:07,360
here's where we get that very fun claim

2284
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,440
that there's no claim

2285
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,199
either the original lorenz system or

2286
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,600
coupled lorenz system possesses a markov

2287
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,639
blanket

2288
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,719
we're not describing

2289
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,560
the territory

2290
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,400
i don't even think we're even describing

2291
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,960
the first level of the map

2292
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,880
the claim here is that there exists a

2293
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,360
laplacian approximation to these kinds

2294
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,760
of systems that in virtue of the zero

2295
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,080
elements of the hessian feature markov

2296
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,120
blankets

2297
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,320
so this is one reason why you know while

2298
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,480
also acknowledging that there's many

2299
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,880
perspectives and so much to learn

2300
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,560
that we do want to be

2301
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,040
precise with our language

2302
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,199
because it's easy enough to say that the

2303
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:50,080
system has a markov blanket or there is

2304
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,239
a markov blanket in the system or all

2305
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,080
these other ways which prepositions and

2306
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,000
nouns might be combined

2307
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,440
and those might be so misleading it

2308
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,679
could be truly incredible

2309
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,480
so

2310
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,920
it's a

2311
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,679
word of warning

2312
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:06,719
because

2313
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,360
as we figure out exactly what the

2314
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,320
technical details are

2315
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,600
and

2316
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,120
continue to clarify here it will matter

2317
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,280
which natural language words we use to

2318
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,639
describe it and it really does matter

2319
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,080
dean

2320
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,040
so

2321
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,000
let me

2322
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,760
add to that daniel so on an abstracted

2323
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,600
level

2324
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,719
uh we can we can frame the problem as

2325
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,239
as in or out

2326
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,000
and then when we translate that into the

2327
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,440
physical space

2328
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,120
we know when something

2329
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,560
is entangled

2330
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,560
or when something is different

2331
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,560
but i think what this allows us for on

2332
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,000
the abstract level is to examine

2333
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,520
to sample

2334
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,600
the markov blanket

2335
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,719
as

2336
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,000
in and out it gives us the potential for

2337
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,639
a second way of looking at

2338
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,440
how those two things work together the

2339
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,719
markup blanket has both a divider

2340
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,440
and an enveloper

2341
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,360
do you agree

2342
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,880
so so on an abstracted level it's very

2343
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,360
important to be precise

2344
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,920
but if we include this

2345
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,840
we have to accept the fact that on an

2346
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,000
abstracted level in and out

2347
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,280
must be part of our

2348
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,960
our repertoire not just in or out

2349
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,360
because one is more precise

2350
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,080
what is active inference while the other

2351
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,280
allows for what if active inference the

2352
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,639
and would you agree

2353
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:43,679
i

2354
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,320
think i agree

2355
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,920
i'm just imagining that it could be

2356
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,639
possible to design a system where there

2357
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,040
was one coupling

2358
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,840
going out but there was no coupling back

2359
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,199
in

2360
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,080
so

2361
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,920
one could devise edge case matrices

2362
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,719
that

2363
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,080
have various kinds of properties

2364
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,280
would those

2365
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,920
even be good maps of systems that we

2366
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,280
care about

2367
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,120
probably not

2368
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:13,840
so

2369
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,159
for some of the basic attributes like of

2370
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,920
communication of course if one person's

2371
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,920
not wearing their headphones like yeah

2372
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,760
the systems are coupled one person's

2373
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,120
talking and the other person can hear

2374
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,320
them but not return any information

2375
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,560
right so it's like that's

2376
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,080
interesting it's a type of coupling that

2377
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,520
systems can have

2378
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,600
and it has a different blanket because

2379
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,880
of that

2380
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,440
but especially for systems where we want

2381
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,920
to think about states that are

2382
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,360
influencing the environment and vice

2383
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,120
versa whether it's communication or

2384
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,280
stigmargy or coupling or collective

2385
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,320
behavior

2386
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,800
that whole class of systems

2387
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,560
it's extremely important to have of

2388
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,600
course in and out and more and less and

2389
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,760
different

2390
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,760
i wouldn't drop i wouldn't drop or sorry

2391
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,960
steven i just got to get this in i

2392
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,600
wouldn't drop or i'm i'm actually say

2393
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,120
suggesting that we

2394
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,920
we

2395
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,000
this tells us we

2396
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,360
must also

2397
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,400
contemplate and so that's like saying

2398
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,560
okay so which is more important that the

2399
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,840
positive ions are the or the negative

2400
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,480
ions they're going to congregate

2401
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,719
and we can tell the difference but we

2402
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,520
shouldn't apply a value all the time

2403
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,760
there are times when we can just see the

2404
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,480
difference and accept that for what it

2405
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,920
for what it is as opposed to

2406
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,679
always jumping to the idea that

2407
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:38,000
something has to be

2408
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,199
more or less that the positive ions are

2409
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,639
more important than the negative ones

2410
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,560
maybe they are but we shouldn't jump to

2411
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,719
that right away done i'm done

2412
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,560
okay closing thought on this steven and

2413
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,679
then we're going to get to free energy

2414
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,040
principle

2415
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,639
yeah um

2416
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,960
so yeah just just mention a little bit

2417
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,960
of what dean said there like the the

2418
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,560
yeah if something's a charged particle

2419
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,880
how much is the system of the

2420
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,239
molecule

2421
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,840
showing the distribution of charge and

2422
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,360
how much is it the quality of the

2423
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,600
thickness of that thing right so i

2424
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,080
suppose and and that that

2425
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,400
becomes i don't think there's a

2426
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,880
definite transition and and i'm glad you

2427
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,320
went back to this diagram this is the

2428
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
one i just want to mention there then

2429
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,080
just to

2430
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,239
that the arrows there on the right so

2431
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,639
where century states

2432
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,400
um it shows that the sensory states are

2433
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,719
related

2434
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:35,360
to the same external states as the

2435
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,920
action states are affecting so it shows

2436
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,040
it's almost like there's a there's a

2437
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,040
regime of attention

2438
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,880
um so it's not

2439
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,719
the century states aren't reading

2440
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,480
something coming in

2441
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,840
about something which is completely

2442
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,920
unrelated to you know it's not like i'm

2443
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,840
looking i'm acting in front of me but

2444
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,360
actually my eyes in the back of my head

2445
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,840
right so my sensory there's there's a

2446
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,440
there's an alignment

2447
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,880
and and then

2448
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,560
when i look to the the left

2449
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,040
this this coupling that's going on then

2450
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,639
between

2451
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,639
in in the way that it's set up between

2452
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,920
this

2453
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,960
it's saying it's it's it's um

2454
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,719
it's not a markov blanket when it's

2455
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,480
saying it's a coupled system

2456
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,159
so it's sort of saying in a way that

2457
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:21,920
this more slightly more nascent version

2458
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,239
there's this kind of um there's still a

2459
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,159
spookiness about it i suppose we might

2460
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,159
say it's is that this sort of a

2461
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,880
it's not it's not it doesn't drop out as

2462
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,199
far as a markov blanket as there's that

2463
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,199
kind of

2464
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:38,000
resonation going on and i suppose

2465
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,520
somewhere between left and right

2466
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,280
you start to become

2467
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,040
you you meet the

2468
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,520
the conditions of a mark of blanket and

2469
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,960
i suppose

2470
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,679
you know that's an interesting point

2471
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:52,880
i don't want to just

2472
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,320
make the water murky with too many

2473
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,239
terminology we haven't brought attention

2474
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:58,000
in it's not related to what we are

2475
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,239
discussing here but i i see what you

2476
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:01,199
mean

2477
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,400
that yes

2478
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,800
if actions were influencing state a you

2479
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,000
know your actions were moving something

2480
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,360
up or down but you were observing the

2481
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,159
left right yes that's a different kind

2482
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,480
of system than if you're observing and

2483
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,960
acting on the up down movement of

2484
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,560
something

2485
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,480
that's not a regime of attention but i

2486
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,360
know what you mean

2487
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,480
let's get to the fep

2488
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,520
okay

2489
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,920
finally

2490
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,719
remember that

2491
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,000
edges

2492
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,480
reflect statistical relationships which

2493
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,639
is the other side of the coin of saying

2494
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,440
that the absence of an edge reflects a

2495
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,760
conditional independence

2496
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,280
so

2497
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,199
one can provide a definition of the

2498
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,080
conditional density over external states

2499
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,719
so probability density that's why it was

2500
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,560
so important to go from dynamics to

2501
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
densities in section two

2502
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,840
and we're going to think about that

2503
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,199
external density probability density

2504
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,239
conditional statistical density as being

2505
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,400
parameterized by the conditional

2506
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,880
expectations of internal states given

2507
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,560
external states

2508
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,199
here's the formalism

2509
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,560
see how

2510
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,639
the

2511
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,679
coupled systems have a flow

2512
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:18,800
where like

2513
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
given where you were on one even if it

2514
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,960
were a little noisier as long as it

2515
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,199
looked like an oval as long as you were

2516
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,639
like you'd know that if you were low on

2517
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,320
the left you were going to be low on the

2518
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,920
up and down if you were further to the

2519
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,840
right you'd be higher up on the y-axis

2520
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,920
okay but imagine if the flow was like in

2521
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,480
a circle you'd say okay we're at x on

2522
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,920
the zero well

2523
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,920
you really don't know because you you

2524
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
could be low you could be high

2525
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,600
or imagine if it was just like a scatter

2526
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,600
cloud no matter where you were you would

2527
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,040
like it was everywhere in the box you

2528
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,400
wouldn't really know

2529
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,239
but because

2530
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,120
there's a manifold

2531
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,320
then

2532
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,480
this admits the possibility

2533
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,840
of a

2534
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,440
which means like sort of like

2535
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,920
function-like and stretchable

2536
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,320
map between the sufficient statistics of

2537
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,880
the respective densities

2538
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,040
not the territory

2539
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,679
not the first map i don't even know if

2540
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,679
we're at the second map anymore we're

2541
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,120
talking about sufficient statistics

2542
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,960
of densities

2543
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,880
of approximations

2544
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,760
okay

2545
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,840
i think it's a death blow for realism

2546
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,440
personally but i would love to hear

2547
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,679
somebody who thinks it's not

2548
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,840
the existence of this mapping

2549
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,920
rests upon a continuously differentiable

2550
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,560
and invertible map which is linear under

2551
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,840
laplace approximation

2552
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,480
there's a few technical pieces there but

2553
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,520
it's almost like we set up

2554
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,120
the system

2555
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,120
in a way that was defined only by its

2556
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,239
coupling

2557
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,480
but then we also got to choose our

2558
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,360
approximation approach

2559
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,159
and it turns out that with a system with

2560
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,159
interesting coupling dynamics enough to

2561
01:32:58,159 --> 01:32:59,920
befuddle almost every other kind of

2562
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,440
model out there

2563
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,120
the approximation

2564
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,320
has a really nice relationship

2565
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,199
that recapitulates aspects of the system

2566
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,159
and

2567
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,360
lets us map like if we're on low on here

2568
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,960
we can go to low on here and low and

2569
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,440
here to low on here like it's a kind of

2570
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,880
it's a function that can go both ways

2571
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,760
and so

2572
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,199
that is

2573
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,120
going to be

2574
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,080
the relationship sigma mapping between

2575
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,480
the internal and the external states

2576
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,639
which was explored more

2577
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,560
in the bayesian mechanics paper number

2578
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,719
26.

2579
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:39,600
this means the autonomous flow

2580
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,080
can be expressed as a gradient flow on a

2581
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,600
free energy functional of the

2582
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,800
variational density

2583
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,159
here are those four states four kinds of

2584
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,360
states external sense action internal

2585
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,159
and those are going to be expressed as a

2586
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,159
tuple it has to be because it has to be

2587
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:01,040
all four of those states co-evolving

2588
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,560
and those have a gradient flow gamma and

2589
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,880
then the upside down triangle

2590
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,840
plus

2591
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,120
the solenoidal flow so remember way back

2592
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:11,920
when

2593
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,679
when we saw that we had q solenoidal g

2594
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,600
gamma for gradients

2595
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,400
and then

2596
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,920
lambda for housekeeping okay so now that

2597
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,960
is coming back into play

2598
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,960
the solenoidal

2599
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,679
is still a single term that's just the

2600
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,679
potent the potential function that

2601
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,280
self-supprisal

2602
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,080
and

2603
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,960
one

2604
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,960
solenoidal term

2605
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,600
then we have a gradient over

2606
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,639
these four states and then the lambda

2607
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,480
housekeeping

2608
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,679
that

2609
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,840
can be rewritten

2610
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,000
and now pi

2611
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,320
again

2612
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,199
let

2613
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,199
let the ontology develop so that we can

2614
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,719
resolve some of this but notice how

2615
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,880
particular states pi

2616
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,000
are the blanket and the internal okay

2617
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,960
but

2618
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,199
how have we usually used pi

2619
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,560
policy

2620
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,280
action selection so this is a different

2621
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,040
pie

2622
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,600
the free energy functional on

2623
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,199
particular states

2624
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,600
particular states let's call them

2625
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,719
equals

2626
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,119
the self-supprisal on the particular

2627
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:22,159
states

2628
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:23,440
plus

2629
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,638
a divergence term

2630
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,840
that is the form

2631
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,440
that then

2632
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,960
lends

2633
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,760
the ability to interpret that

2634
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,840
free energy functional on particular

2635
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,199
states

2636
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,280
to be rewritten in several ways

2637
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,880
including

2638
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,119
energy minus entropy that's a very

2639
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,199
classical chemical way to talk about

2640
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,400
free energy

2641
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,600
to be phrased as the divergence

2642
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,760
between

2643
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,400
the q distribution on external states

2644
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,040
and the p distribution

2645
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,600
on external states conditioned on

2646
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,400
particular states

2647
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,239
plus the self-supprisal of those

2648
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,960
particular states or the one that's

2649
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,320
closest to the bayesian information

2650
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,360
criterion bayesian modeling world but

2651
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,800
still being shown as equivalent to

2652
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,080
is the accuracy minus model complexity

2653
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,480
and the evidence lower bound

2654
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,800
so that's where we we've seen these

2655
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,199
formalisms come out

2656
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,639
many many times

2657
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,400
but we're approaching it from a very

2658
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,159
different way and a lot more bottom up

2659
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:37,600
and

2660
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,199
i think but again would be open to

2661
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,080
people

2662
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,199
correcting

2663
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,480
in a way that

2664
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,639
fully embraces the map territory

2665
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,520
distinction and makes no bones about it

2666
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,840
whereas if you just pop in from the top

2667
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,199
with these formalisms it might seem

2668
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,040
like they're describing aspects of the

2669
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,199
system but i hope that the way we've

2670
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,119
approached this over the last like six

2671
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,119
hours of live streams literally and the

2672
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,800
way that the authors wrote it so

2673
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,520
carefully makes it clear we're talking

2674
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,639
about these formalisms on

2675
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,800
probably not even the first map

2676
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,880
and maybe the second map or summary

2677
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,960
statistics thereof these are

2678
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,800
relationships that are intrinsic to our

2679
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,199
approach of map making

2680
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,960
because we did the laplacian

2681
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,719
approximation et cetera et cetera et

2682
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,199
cetera

2683
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:29,119
stephen d

2684
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,440
yeah this is very helpful um i might

2685
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,800
just ask we go

2686
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,560
and walk through the very first sentence

2687
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,719
again in a second just because i think

2688
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,480
it'd be helpful just to reiterate but

2689
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,480
from what you're saying and i i hear

2690
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,320
this really clearly is

2691
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,040
the the particular states

2692
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,360
and and the thinness

2693
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,280
of maintaining particular states

2694
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,199
potentially or of whatever those

2695
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,719
particular states

2696
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:54,800
persist

2697
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,239
effectively

2698
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,000
then is

2699
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,280
the same

2700
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,480
when at a higher order level over time

2701
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,239
and space as a policy

2702
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:05,760
because let's not bring policy on

2703
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,119
picture yet we just haven't gotten there

2704
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,839
but particularly

2705
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,840
okay i won't i won't jump the gun on

2706
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,960
that but

2707
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,960
um

2708
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,600
i i suppose

2709
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,920
the the the point is

2710
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,520
just to say that

2711
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,119
we we can still be in the realm of

2712
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,480
thingness

2713
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,840
okay we can still be in the realm of

2714
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,679
thingness because we're talking about

2715
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,199
particular states

2716
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,639
of things

2717
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,400
so we haven't got and i won't say beyond

2718
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,320
that and then maybe just just to go

2719
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,760
through the ontology not

2720
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,679
just of that first sentence just to

2721
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,679
reiterate just to get it clearer

2722
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,840
again of autonomous flow

2723
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,679
expected internal state could you just

2724
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,679
recap that just to

2725
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,679
just unpack that a little bit more just

2726
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,480
so it's a little bit clearer

2727
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,239
okay

2728
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:53,600
so

2729
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,480
the

2730
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,239
autonomous flow

2731
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,520
so autonomous states are actions

2732
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,520
which are not we're not even bringing

2733
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,440
policy selection in so it's the right

2734
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,760
direction we want to go we want to be

2735
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,360
talking about internal states that are

2736
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,520
actually doing planning as inference

2737
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,600
that affect their action states but for

2738
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,119
now we're just treating the action

2739
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,480
states as outgoing statistical

2740
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,119
dependencies and then we're just we're

2741
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,480
pausing on

2742
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,639
how the actions are selected we're just

2743
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,000
because in the lorenz system there's no

2744
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,560
policy selection but there are external

2745
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,040
states that are modified by states those

2746
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,800
are the active states so it's almost

2747
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,040
like we can talk about action without

2748
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,040
policy inference

2749
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,000
so the autonomous states

2750
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,920
the autonomous flow

2751
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,400
at the expected internal state

2752
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,800
so these are expectations

2753
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,920
of

2754
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,239
autonomous states action

2755
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,639
outgoing and internal states

2756
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,199
can be expressed as a gradient flow so

2757
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,239
now it's like

2758
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:58,000
we're going to um rather than have a six

2759
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,400
state system

2760
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,320
we're going to

2761
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,080
rewrite

2762
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:04,960
as

2763
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,159
four

2764
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,560
remember we pulled out four kinds of

2765
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,080
notes

2766
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,520
and now we're going to express a flow

2767
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,239
not in a six-dimensional space

2768
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,320
where each dimension was a measurement

2769
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,679
that we were making

2770
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,719
but express a flow

2771
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,199
over the four kinds of states

2772
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:29,760
and then that means that even if there

2773
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,080
was a bunch of internal nodes that were

2774
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,480
communicating to each other

2775
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,119
we could still use this four-fold

2776
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:38,719
breakdown

2777
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,800
william blake hashtag bucky hashtag

2778
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,000
fristen

2779
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,800
no matter how many specifics were inside

2780
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,920
the internal

2781
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,400
or how many blanket states there were

2782
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,000
like how many nodes in the graph or how

2783
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,159
many external states because now it's

2784
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:55,040
like a flow over kinds

2785
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,800
of nodes

2786
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,560
and then that

2787
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,960
because the nodes are defined by their

2788
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,760
directionality of relationship

2789
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,119
like how they influence each other right

2790
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,880
like internal and external we know don't

2791
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,560
directly influence each other they're

2792
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,920
conditionally independent based upon

2793
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,760
blanket states etc

2794
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,480
that allows us to write formalisms that

2795
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,199
are like evergreen

2796
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,600
and can be expressed as flow

2797
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,040
dean

2798
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,600
yeah i would just say that when i when i

2799
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,880
first encountered these kind of

2800
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,239
formalisms

2801
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,320
i always ask so and then what happened

2802
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,440
and that's when i

2803
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,360
coined the phrase when in doubt

2804
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,679
zoom in zoom out but i didn't

2805
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,520
want that zooming in and zooming out to

2806
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,320
be collapsed just to the optical zoom

2807
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
i assumed that your legs wouldn't become

2808
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,000
paralyzed when you

2809
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,239
picked up a telescope or a microscope

2810
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:45,760
that you would still zoom in and zoom

2811
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,880
out by

2812
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,159
moving

2813
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,600
right so the inference is in doubt

2814
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,000
so how do you overcome that you become

2815
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,360
more active but not just with your eyes

2816
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,280
you actually pick yourself up and move

2817
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,520
yourself around a little bit more

2818
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,719
a la

2819
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,119
you don't just have to be on on the

2820
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,840
on the north end of the carousel

2821
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,159
sometimes you can pick up a ladder and

2822
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,560
look down on it as well and that will

2823
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,920
give you a whole

2824
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,920
new set of data whereas more

2825
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,440
complementary data a different

2826
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,639
collection

2827
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:19,760
and so

2828
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,360
that's why i think it's really really

2829
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,159
good to be able to see that

2830
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,880
and understand what it implies

2831
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,560
it basically says if you're if you're

2832
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,920
if you're not sure

2833
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,719
act some more

2834
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,000
how could i disagree with acting first

2835
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,880
serve

2836
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,320
let's just look at this slide and then

2837
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,280
stephen so this functional

2838
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,639
the flow over the four kinds of states

2839
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,480
that is using

2840
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:52,000
this blanket partitioning paradigm

2841
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,880
can be expressed in several forms

2842
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,280
expected energy

2843
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,920
e big e is expectation

2844
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,159
expected energy minus the entropy of the

2845
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,639
variational distribution remember the q

2846
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,080
variational distributions like the one

2847
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,400
that we get to control q of mu that's

2848
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,199
the q of internal states

2849
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,880
which is equivalent to

2850
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,199
the self information

2851
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,840
fancy i plus the kl divergence between

2852
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,239
the variational and conditional density

2853
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,400
that's this kl divergence term which is

2854
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,040
always greater than zero so

2855
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,360
self-supprisal is always zero or greater

2856
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,840
you can't have negative surprisal

2857
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,719
um

2858
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,760
and then the divergence is always going

2859
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,760
to be positive as well

2860
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,440
this can be decomposed into

2861
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,159
accuracy and complexity

2862
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,639
so that's this third framing and in that

2863
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,480
setting

2864
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,000
negative free energy becomes the

2865
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,920
evidence lower bound or elbow which will

2866
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,920
be familiar to many people with machine

2867
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,000
learning backgrounds

2868
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,920
okay amazing so those are the three

2869
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,360
different formalisms and how they fell

2870
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,159
out

2871
01:43:58,159 --> 01:43:59,679
this is the basis of the free energy

2872
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,840
principle wait what's the free energy

2873
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,119
principle

2874
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:05,600
put simply it means that the expected

2875
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
internal states of a particular

2876
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,600
partition

2877
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,080
at non-equilibrium steady state

2878
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,080
can be cast as encoding conditional or

2879
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,159
bayesian beliefs about external states

2880
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,639
that's the free energy principle

2881
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,560
in this paper

2882
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,480
not the first not the last way it'll be

2883
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,119
defined and not the only but that's how

2884
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,159
they

2885
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,080
discuss it here

2886
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,320
and basically we moved from early on

2887
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
it's like tying our shoe with a density

2888
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,480
to dynamics side

2889
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,760
and now

2890
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,159
we have this whole universe of

2891
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,679
formalisms

2892
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,360
that connect

2893
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,320
free energy-looking formalisms like

2894
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,920
chemistry

2895
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,040
with information theory formalisms

2896
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:53,840
so

2897
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,880
thermochemistry with energy and entropy

2898
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,080
with

2899
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,000
thermal information

2900
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,400
divergence and self-information

2901
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,560
to

2902
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,040
information and inference with accuracy

2903
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,639
minus complexity

2904
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:09,600
as

2905
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,360
a modeling heuristic

2906
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,040
so that's big

2907
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,440
free energy is big

2908
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,400
and

2909
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,000
then they immediately go to talk about

2910
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
physiological perspectives

2911
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,040
and how

2912
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,760
that surprisal function

2913
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,800
that constitutes the potential

2914
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,360
is log model evidence so

2915
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,480
if you're getting good evidence for your

2916
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,159
physiological model you're spending a

2917
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:37,760
lot of times in your preferred and

2918
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,560
expected physiological states

2919
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,320
and that can be seen as simply a

2920
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,400
statement of homeostasis

2921
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,480
where outgoing statistical dependencies

2922
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,560
i.e active states

2923
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,040
maintain anteroceptive signals

2924
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,080
i.e

2925
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,880
incoming state sensory states within

2926
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,679
characteristic physiological ranges

2927
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:58,400
you

2928
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,440
minimize your surprise about that

2929
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,159
until you don't and you dissipate

2930
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,638
stephen

2931
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,119
amazing

2932
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,360
this this really ties into the active

2933
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,840
infant's paradigm shift

2934
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,520
because okay

2935
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,719
traditionally if we're going to have

2936
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:17,760
represented like traditionally

2937
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,920
representationalism for instance

2938
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,000
like you were saying it does really

2939
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,840
really

2940
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,639
throw that out in a way because

2941
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,040
if i have 100 cameras normally

2942
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,880
and i took 100 different cameras all

2943
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,280
taking a photo it's going to make it 100

2944
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,400
times more

2945
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:38,159
blurry in in that sense however in this

2946
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:39,360
sense

2947
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,600
a hundred sources

2948
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,840
in this

2949
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,600
noisy

2950
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,960
dynamical

2951
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,280
gives me a hundred ways

2952
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,719
to

2953
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:52,639
integrate

2954
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,199
free energy reduction

2955
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,199
and even actually the noise of me moving

2956
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:01,520
it 100 ways by 100 cameras gives me more

2957
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,360
and more informational

2958
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,880
thermodynamic

2959
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,239
ways in

2960
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:08,719
so that that just shifts very much the

2961
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:09,679
way

2962
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:12,080
we might think about how

2963
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,600
to know about

2964
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,000
how to act in the world

2965
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,880
cool

2966
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,920
um

2967
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,239
let's continue on and we'll probably do

2968
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:21,840
a few minutes after the hour to get to

2969
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,600
these last few points

2970
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,040
so

2971
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,280
we've been talking about

2972
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,280
different ways that we can talk about

2973
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,840
the free energy functional of

2974
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,280
the particular states

2975
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,960
5.1

2976
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,320
is where

2977
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,480
this idea of the internal states as a

2978
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:43,679
generative model and self-evidencing or

2979
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:47,760
like the minimization of self-surprise

2980
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,440
is really leaned into so the alternative

2981
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,199
and deflationary perspective

2982
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:54,960
rests on noting that the free energy

2983
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,719
gradients are also the gradients of

2984
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,280
self-information so it's like the free

2985
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,040
energy itself

2986
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,239
is a wind that's difficult to latch on

2987
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,960
to so the free energy bowl the one where

2988
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,560
you'd be doing strictly as well as you

2989
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,119
could if you were on the bottom of it

2990
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,040
we're not on that bowl

2991
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,679
but the one that we can

2992
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:19,520
be keenly aware of is our self-supprisal

2993
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,040
so if

2994
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,440
the self-supprisal gradient

2995
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,360
is aligned with

2996
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,600
the free energy gradients

2997
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,639
then

2998
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,360
reducing our uncertainty

2999
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,960
about sensory states incoming

3000
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,320
helps us

3001
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,320
on the way towards minimizing free

3002
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,400
energy gradients reducing that

3003
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,320
difference

3004
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,239
the organism wants to be minimally

3005
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,560
surprised about expected and preferred

3006
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,920
observations

3007
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,040
and those are the perceptions or

3008
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,239
measurements

3009
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,080
more technically it wants to be

3010
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,280
minimally surprised about expected

3011
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,560
states

3012
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,800
and then preferences are going to play a

3013
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,639
key role when we talk about active

3014
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,560
systems that do resist dissipation

3015
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,480
this is where the moth to the flame

3016
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,440
comes and i just i love this plot arc

3017
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,600
from 2006

3018
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,920
ice queen fristen with the winged

3019
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,280
snowflake

3020
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,199
and then you know things are heating up

3021
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:18,719
for act dimp

3022
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,639
others are being drawn like a chaotic

3023
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,199
moth to the flame they come close but

3024
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:28,119
then it burns and then they fly away

3025
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,040
so one could imagine these kinds of

3026
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,520
systems to be like stochastic chaos

3027
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,360
and that could be now again we're

3028
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,280
thinking about previously the lorenz

3029
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,199
system was like maybe

3030
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,599
a particle in a chaotic weather system

3031
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:44,960
so that was like the weather systems

3032
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,880
that lorenz was studying

3033
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,520
but now we're going to be thinking about

3034
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,560
particular states like a particular moth

3035
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,000
that's able to

3036
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,320
not just have outgoing statistical

3037
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,239
dependencies

3038
01:49:58,239 --> 01:49:59,679
but to do

3039
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,360
policy selection

3040
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,159
so this is where we actually get

3041
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,719
adaptive active inference and again you

3042
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,719
know if there's two kinds of moths some

3043
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:10,639
of them are just particles and then they

3044
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:11,760
get burnt when they get burnt and they

3045
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,040
don't when they don't

3046
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,199
some will survive and some won't but the

3047
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,679
ones that do

3048
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:18,719
enact

3049
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,199
effective policy selection

3050
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,360
are going to be persistent even a day

3051
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,679
later so then the lap adopter have been

3052
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,080
around for millions of years so is it

3053
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,920
really any surprise that the moths have

3054
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,119
adaptive

3055
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:32,639
behavioral systems

3056
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,119
but that when the niche changes like

3057
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:37,520
with electric nighttime lighting that

3058
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,840
that doesn't entail that it's going to

3059
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,880
instantly be the adaptive system for

3060
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,679
that new niche

3061
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,599
we can think about the motion of a moth

3062
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,679
attracted towards a flame

3063
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,320
but constantly thwarted by turbulent or

3064
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,159
solenoidal air currents

3065
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:56,159
because active states influence sensory

3066
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,400
states and possibly external states this

3067
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,960
would look as if the particle the moth

3068
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,440
was trying to attain its most likely

3069
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,920
state in the face of random fluctuations

3070
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,320
and solenoidal dynamics

3071
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,119
so

3072
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:10,880
it's like there's those arrows the

3073
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,480
irrotational component are like

3074
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,719
converging the moth to the flame

3075
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,960
but then like overshoot and the windy

3076
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,440
room are blowing it around and so again

3077
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,639
there's the moth in the room and we

3078
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,040
could look at it in the x y and the z

3079
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,639
and if the candle were in the center of

3080
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:25,679
the room

3081
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,320
it would be like a bowl

3082
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,639
that the moth were converging towards

3083
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,320
for any two dimensions that you looked

3084
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,400
at and indeed all three dimensions when

3085
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,159
considered together

3086
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:38,320
and the movement of that particle the

3087
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,960
dynamics of that particle

3088
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,440
would be related to something about the

3089
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,800
flow of the air in that room

3090
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,280
with a pullback attractor

3091
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,760
this perspective emphasizes the active

3092
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,760
part of self-evidencing sometimes

3093
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,320
referred to as active inference so we

3094
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,719
were calculating the potential the

3095
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,520
self-supprisal the outgoing dependencies

3096
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,920
for particles before we talked about

3097
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,920
policy selection

3098
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,040
and that is showing mere

3099
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,000
active inference as it's called but then

3100
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,080
when you think about the real world

3101
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,560
where only the anti-dissipative systems

3102
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,040
persist and the successful ones even

3103
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,159
more so

3104
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,159
that's where policy selection comes into

3105
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,199
play

3106
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:25,360
and that's actually where this paper

3107
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,960
ends

3108
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,119
they basically just

3109
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,599
bring it to that point

3110
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,760
and say all systems are going to be able

3111
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,639
to be framed within this way again not

3112
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,239
the territories

3113
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:40,080
all of the approximations that we make

3114
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,480
will have these attributes

3115
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,679
and then

3116
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:45,920
we can imagine that there are some

3117
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,760
systems where the internal states are

3118
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,520
not just acting as if they're doing

3119
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,360
conditional expectations on external

3120
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,199
states but then they take those

3121
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,119
conditional expectations like about the

3122
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,239
weather

3123
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:58,960
and then there's another node for policy

3124
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,360
selection like the other pi

3125
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,280
policy selection in the models we've

3126
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,159
seen

3127
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:06,800
and then that pie can be like put on the

3128
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,800
jacket or not those are like the two

3129
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,320
affordances

3130
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:13,040
or those are the two states in the

3131
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,520
affordance variable

3132
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,719
and then

3133
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,880
in a dissipative world

3134
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,320
you're going to see

3135
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,400
adaptive agents as the ones that are

3136
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,880
able to recurrently adapt to changing

3137
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,800
and chaotic circumstance to repeatedly

3138
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,880
come back to that candle

3139
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,440
and so just to summarize then we'll just

3140
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,560
um

3141
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,000
if there's any implications we want to

3142
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,840
touch but we'll summarize

3143
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:42,400
um they constructed a laplacian system

3144
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,599
that's quadratic aka bowl like

3145
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:47,599
in its potential function and flow

3146
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:50,000
operators state dependent flow operators

3147
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,119
by the way that includes the

3148
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:53,280
housekeeping function

3149
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,159
that evinces so provides evidence for

3150
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,480
stochastic chaos because it has that

3151
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,159
leopardive exponent that was very

3152
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,159
similar to the ones that were calculated

3153
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,040
from the non-laplace assumptions or

3154
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,040
approximations

3155
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,560
the way that the polynomial

3156
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,719
approximation played out with the first

3157
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,159
and second order approximations

3158
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:18,719
gave a sparsity

3159
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:19,760
which

3160
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,599
can be interpreted as conditional

3161
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,280
independencies

3162
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,599
and a partitioning into four kinds of

3163
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,000
states

3164
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,040
coupled systems

3165
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,920
have

3166
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,320
a conditional synchronization map

3167
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,320
in this example it had a linear form

3168
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,840
they were on that manifold that was like

3169
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,080
y equals x

3170
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,000
and this is important because in these

3171
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,159
laplacian coupled systems

3172
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,080
the conditional synchronization map is

3173
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,639
necessarily diffiomorphic again would be

3174
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,239
awesome if somebody wanted to come on

3175
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:51,840
and like help us see what the technical

3176
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,280
implications of the diffiomorphism is

3177
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,719
but

3178
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:58,000
the simplest

3179
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,760
level is like it doesn't bend back on

3180
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,880
itself

3181
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,520
so it's a good function

3182
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,360
so that means for every sensory state

3183
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,760
there's a unique expected internal state

3184
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,760
and conditional density over external

3185
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,880
states

3186
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,080
so it'd be like yeah when the

3187
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,560
thermometer says like 20 it could be 20

3188
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,840
or 50.

3189
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,520
that's not a very helpful thermometer

3190
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,960
now if you say the thermometer always

3191
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,199
reads half of the temperature or it's

3192
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,840
always double or it's a little noisy

3193
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,159
those are all workable but like the

3194
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,760
thermometer could just totally be

3195
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,560
deceiving you and then it just is a it's

3196
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,560
a wacky world with what the thermometer

3197
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,840
says

3198
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,960
not going to be a very adaptive system

3199
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,040
the resulting formulation can be read as

3200
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,800
bayesian mechanics

3201
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,560
in which internal states on average

3202
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,880
parameterize belief of a bayesian sort

3203
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,040
about external states

3204
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,320
just like these equations

3205
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,400
when applied to particles and

3206
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,239
statistical distributions were

3207
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,320
statistical mechanics

3208
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,040
we're taking the full bayesian insight

3209
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,040
and reading these equivalencies and

3210
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,159
formalisms as a bayesian mechanics

3211
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:06,480
so that's the summary of 5-2

3212
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,000
and then there's a few implications that

3213
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,760
they get into but we'll

3214
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,599
first have any questions so dean and

3215
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:12,840
then

3216
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,960
stephen well i just think it's

3217
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,639
fascinating that

3218
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:17,920
it doesn't matter whether we're talking

3219
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,480
moths or or people we're kind of

3220
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:24,080
blissfully unaware of the statistical

3221
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,560
uh manifold

3222
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,639
floating around us prior to us being

3223
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,800
pulled back to that flame and either

3224
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,560
becoming the hero moth

3225
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,960
or the fool moth we don't discover that

3226
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,560
until afterwards

3227
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,639
but if we could be aware of the kind of

3228
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,639
the statistical

3229
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:44,239
distribution in play prior to us

3230
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:46,719
being pulled it might help

3231
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:48,239
i don't think it don't i don't think it

3232
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:49,679
determines much

3233
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:51,280
but it certainly

3234
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:55,519
enlightens as opposed to being lit up

3235
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,119
yeah in the moth example i think well

3236
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,239
you know but if it really reaches the

3237
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:00,960
flame it dies so maybe that's not even

3238
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,040
the final perfect example for how

3239
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,440
attractors work that'd be like a a bowl

3240
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,159
with a hole at the bottom so it again it

3241
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,480
just it's it's a heuristic it helps us

3242
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,840
think about the kinds of systems that

3243
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,360
we're talking about but

3244
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,480
um realism interpretation asides even

3245
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,920
that example doesn't capture the whole

3246
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,320
thing because it's a metaphor because

3247
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,880
it's like map of map of territory so

3248
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,719
it's totally chill stephen

3249
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,800
yeah this uh

3250
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,159
the evincing or evan says stochastic

3251
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:33,679
chaos which

3252
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:35,360
wasn't a word i'd heard of before to be

3253
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:39,280
honest um is this idea of equality um

3254
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,880
so that that's really

3255
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,040
useful that how

3256
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,080
it gives a sense of how

3257
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:46,880
um

3258
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,760
both there can be

3259
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,520
chaos in the attractor and the noise

3260
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,880
maintained at least at some level

3261
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,040
throughout because the

3262
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,159
um in most cases the noise is just um

3263
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,280
averaged away in in other scenarios so

3264
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,400
this is

3265
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,400
this is this this piece where we tapping

3266
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,840
into that um

3267
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,040
quality

3268
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,840
is really interesting and then that then

3269
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,760
tying into the bayesian mechanics all

3270
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,199
the way down

3271
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,599
um is uh

3272
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,960
very very useful especially when i think

3273
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,560
the bayesian mechanics as i mentioned

3274
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,840
before

3275
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,800
is stacked it's like

3276
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,480
it's not saying

3277
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,880
this is where everything is different to

3278
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,800
evidence in it's like like we're going

3279
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,560
to give better evidence which or better

3280
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,760
evidence which make us think we're going

3281
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,800
to show a more accurate lorenz attractor

3282
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,880
solution no it's

3283
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,400
evinces

3284
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,199
and we can stack up and add these fuzzy

3285
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,040
qualities together

3286
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,280
and we'll still have a fuzzy quality but

3287
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,639
maybe we'll have one which is a little

3288
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:53,440
bit

3289
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,480
more

3290
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:57,440
practical and that's the game in town

3291
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:01,520
here is practicality so i like that who

3292
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,960
also um

3293
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,440
it does average out noise

3294
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,760
the internal states on average

3295
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,440
the expectation

3296
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,199
parameterizes beliefs and so that's

3297
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,840
going to be a major challenge

3298
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,159
is to go from these expectation and mean

3299
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:18,880
field approximations

3300
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,280
without going into ergodicity that is

3301
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,199
literally the whole challenge

3302
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:25,760
the laplacian is like a quadratic that's

3303
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:26,719
fit

3304
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,960
on another distribution which we're not

3305
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,000
even caring to learn the form of

3306
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,239
and so we could say that the expectation

3307
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:36,560
the single number expectation the

3308
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,800
expectation of a child in that class is

3309
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,320
five feet tall

3310
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,800
but maybe it's all four and six feet but

3311
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,119
if we fit a laplacian on that

3312
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,960
it's gonna be at five looking like a

3313
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,400
quadratic

3314
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,199
so the map and the territory are not the

3315
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:52,400
same

3316
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,679
and it is a significant challenge across

3317
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:59,679
domains to connect some of the

3318
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,840
approximations

3319
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,719
that

3320
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,560
are double-edged swords

3321
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,440
like let's approximate over a bunch of

3322
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,360
possible futures

3323
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,440
or let's approximate this way like

3324
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,560
there's no

3325
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,840
free lunch

3326
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,760
so the internal states on average

3327
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,239
parameterized beliefs but does any

3328
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:19,760
given

3329
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,480
internal state parameterize beliefs

3330
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,040
evolution kind of helps us out by saying

3331
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,360
like well on average it's going to get

3332
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,480
better and better that's like the

3333
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,159
fundamental theorem of natural selection

3334
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:32,320
ftns

3335
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,560
and then the ones that don't do as well

3336
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,760
they die

3337
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,080
so evolution in a way helps us get out

3338
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,040
of this

3339
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,440
but the formalism doesn't have that as

3340
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,560
we saw it right now yeah stephen on that

3341
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,040
that's a really good point and and so it

3342
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,199
also does tie into the

3343
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,760
so it gives away to sort of the word

3344
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,080
average but yeah to average or

3345
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:58,320
approximate these faster perturbations

3346
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,599
yet it still maintains perturbations

3347
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:03,280
which could be used at the next nested

3348
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,840
level or in other ways so it's so

3349
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,360
there's an interesting

3350
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,639
question there's an interesting thing

3351
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:09,679
about

3352
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,400
yeah it's reducing and

3353
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:13,280
um

3354
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,800
the the

3355
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,840
the

3356
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,080
overwhelming noise

3357
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,599
yes it's also

3358
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,000
not doing what traditional statistical

3359
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,320
averaging does which is basically crash

3360
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,320
everything down to

3361
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,639
you know a fixed point

3362
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,199
um it gives this ability for it still to

3363
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:33,119
be alive in a way

3364
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,599
absolutely like if we just took the

3365
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:38,639
expectation the single average point

3366
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:39,440
of

3367
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,679
the lorenz attractor itself

3368
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:43,760
it would just be one point in the middle

3369
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,920
of the saddle

3370
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:46,810
okay

3371
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:48,000
[Music]

3372
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,400
but we have something that still has a

3373
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,639
dynamical nature

3374
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:55,599
with a tractable approximation

3375
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:58,960
and the dynamics have a positively open

3376
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,080
of exponent

3377
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,719
so we didn't squash the system down to a

3378
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:05,280
point or a racetrack

3379
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:06,480
we kept

3380
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,360
some of the dynamical and even chaotic

3381
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,520
aspects of the system

3382
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,440
while still being able to talk about

3383
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,360
things on average

3384
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,119
but we're not talking about the average

3385
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:19,199
position of the particle

3386
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,360
yes even quickly on that

3387
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,960
yeah i think that's a good point and

3388
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,199
also just one thing that caught my mind

3389
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,960
is with that butterfly with the moth

3390
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,560
going to the flame

3391
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,280
is it talks about a perspective that's

3392
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,480
been taken

3393
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,280
yet

3394
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,960
and this is probably useful when people

3395
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,080
are thinking

3396
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:38,239
in the applied active inference this is

3397
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:40,560
the perspective that we're having and

3398
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,080
it's possibly more used the word

3399
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,360
perspective because we see a picture of

3400
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,119
a moth if there was no picture there we

3401
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,960
might say a description

3402
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,360
of the scenario okay so there's this

3403
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:50,719
perspective

3404
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:52,159
on the moth

3405
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:55,040
yet the moth isn't necessarily in this

3406
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:59,199
scenario taking a perspective it's

3407
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:00,639
doing

3408
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:03,119
it's it's doing its mothness

3409
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:05,520
yep it's definitely moth's gonna moth

3410
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,560
although the picture was not in the

3411
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,199
paper i added that one but yeah the

3412
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:11,520
winged snowflake was indeed in the 2006

3413
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,920
paper so let's just recap a few of the

3414
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,599
domains of implication and then we'll

3415
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:16,800
close because like

3416
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,560
what a fun

3417
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,800
paper and discussion

3418
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:21,760
so

3419
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,840
one implication

3420
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,920
um but also sort of

3421
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,520
note of caution

3422
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,239
is that just because we took the og

3423
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:32,800
complex system lorenz and coupled it so

3424
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,400
two

3425
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,960
chess moves beyond some sort of simple

3426
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,159
scenario

3427
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:40,159
it doesn't mean that

3428
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:42,960
a synchronization map exists

3429
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:45,760
let alone a good one for any given

3430
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,239
system but

3431
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:49,760
one of the implications of this paper

3432
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,280
was that now we know that for a non-zero

3433
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,760
subset of dynamical systems

3434
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,639
a non-zero subset of chaotic dynamical

3435
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,520
systems and a non-zero subset of

3436
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,639
dynamical chaotic coupled systems

3437
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:06,960
we can get this well-behaved

3438
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,880
approximation map

3439
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:12,560
so not to say all but we know that the

3440
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,840
answer is now

3441
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,679
not none

3442
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,040
so that's a key implication

3443
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,920
another implication was to really start

3444
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,199
to bring in the variational free energy

3445
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:27,760
in terms of generalized synchrony that's

3446
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,760
what opens up to the de costa discrete

3447
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,119
state space synthesis active inference

3448
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:34,880
bayesian surprise

3449
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,480
optimal bayesian design intrinsic

3450
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,639
motivation info masks

3451
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,880
risk sensitive policies kl control

3452
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,560
occam's principle decision theory

3453
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:45,280
utility theory max ends constructal

3454
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,360
theory like

3455
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:49,520
this is not all

3456
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,400
in this paper so a lot more has to be

3457
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,639
done to get to some of these places

3458
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:56,880
especially in such a

3459
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,159
reasoned and bottom-up way

3460
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,840
another implication of the paper is that

3461
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,599
took the helmholtz decomposition in a

3462
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:08,639
new way

3463
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,480
and it might provide a genetic generic

3464
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,440
model for random dynamical systems

3465
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,280
importantly because we connected it so

3466
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,199
closely to bayesian

3467
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:19,440
generative modeling

3468
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,520
it could be possible to do less just

3469
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:22,239
like

3470
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:25,360
let's do descriptive analytics on flow

3471
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,560
to like

3472
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,480
let's have a map

3473
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,719
that we can run both ways

3474
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:32,800
where we're updating the parameters of

3475
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,960
our flow map

3476
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,960
with what we're observing but then we

3477
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,960
can also generate data sets we can

3478
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:41,520
generate counter factuals and so that is

3479
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,320
what allows sparse data sets to play

3480
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,560
into active and fep

3481
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,960
and ties us more closely to modern

3482
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,960
machine learning like variational auto

3483
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:53,599
encoders

3484
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,520
another implication

3485
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,800
um or

3486
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,560
next step

3487
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,560
would be like we were looking at a

3488
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,800
three-dimensional system the x y and z

3489
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,639
of the lorenz attractor

3490
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:05,599
but

3491
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,639
how could we approach high dimensional

3492
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:10,239
dynamical systems

3493
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:12,960
so attractors in 50 dimensions that's a

3494
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,079
little bit different and hard to solve

3495
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:18,639
so they suggest that a way to approach

3496
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,079
this

3497
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:23,920
probably hint cough cough wink wink etc

3498
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:25,679
is to learn

3499
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:28,560
the state dependent flow operator

3500
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,079
and the nests

3501
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:32,400
using deep neural networks

3502
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,079
so it's kind of like

3503
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:35,679
you have a neural network now that

3504
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,840
recognizes bulls

3505
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,760
and so we're still kind of keeping some

3506
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,599
of the same things that we had a

3507
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:44,000
intuitive interpretation of in lower

3508
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,280
dimensions

3509
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,960
it's just like you go like okay i know

3510
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,639
about the cube and then someone says

3511
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:50,239
well there's like an 11 dimensional cube

3512
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:51,520
and you okay

3513
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,079
i kind of know what i don't really see

3514
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:55,679
exactly what that means but i kind of

3515
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,920
see what is being discussed how are we

3516
02:06:57,920 --> 02:06:59,760
going to compute on the 11-dimensional

3517
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:02,960
cube though well neural networks

3518
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,440
and that is actually very close to

3519
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,360
neural stochastic differential equations

3520
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:10,000
and i think this is super exciting

3521
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,520
one could ergo hasn't been done probably

3522
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:14,960
hint hint

3523
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,360
use a separate feed forward neural

3524
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:18,480
network

3525
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,400
to parameterize different components of

3526
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,920
the flow operator and self-information

3527
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,639
so in other words we're taking what we

3528
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:28,560
talked about here

3529
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,560
and we can think about combining it with

3530
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,719
the types of stochastic differential

3531
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:34,400
equations neural stochastic differential

3532
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,800
equations and bayesian neural networks

3533
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,280
all of these uh advances in machine

3534
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:42,000
learning and now we're actually

3535
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,920
coming back to the table

3536
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,719
with new architectures for deep learning

3537
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:48,159
because this would be a deep learning

3538
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:49,760
model it would have a deep neural

3539
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,520
network you know you would benefit from

3540
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,199
having a gpu

3541
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:55,040
but it's an architecture that was

3542
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,760
inspired by the discussions that we had

3543
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,719
here

3544
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,560
and then just the final implications and

3545
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,119
then we'll just have a little closing

3546
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,079
um

3547
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,400
the flows across the boundary

3548
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,320
also notice that a little bit of the

3549
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:11,119
blanket starting to potentially be

3550
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:13,679
inched away from talking more about a

3551
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,760
markov boundary

3552
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,000
and connecting the fep

3553
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,920
to the constructal law

3554
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:20,800
and

3555
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,320
the work of professor adrian bajan who

3556
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,719
honestly is a lot like fristen in some

3557
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:29,760
ways and a really gracious person and

3558
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,719
communicator as well with a long career

3559
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,159
of working towards this kind of a

3560
02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:37,760
unifying flow theory to get towards the

3561
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,000
evolution of design in nature and as the

3562
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,679
image shows like kind of like from flood

3563
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:45,119
plains to lung alveoli that similar kind

3564
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:47,599
of a unifying model

3565
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:48,560
and then

3566
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,679
a final

3567
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:51,440
set of implications

3568
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:54,400
is that we take covariances

3569
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,800
all the time from time series

3570
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,280
that's like how we do

3571
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,199
crypto trading that's how we do weather

3572
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:04,000
prediction that's all kinds of systems

3573
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,960
take covariance matrices on time series

3574
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,719
and so potentially

3575
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:10,480
because

3576
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:13,920
the hessian is recapitulating elements

3577
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,239
of the covariance matrix

3578
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:17,920
it could be possible to have an

3579
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,000
empirical data set

3580
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,400
and empirically take the covariance and

3581
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:24,239
then learn something about the hessian

3582
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:26,400
the curvature of the underlying flow

3583
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,960
states so in other words if you use the

3584
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,040
laplacian approximation even if it's

3585
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,440
stochastic chaotic and dynamic

3586
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,159
that empirical covariance could identify

3587
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:38,239
conditional independencies where there's

3588
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:40,480
a zero

3589
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:42,639
and so in principle

3590
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:44,239
you could furnish a description of

3591
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:46,159
expected flow and the leopard of

3592
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:47,599
exponents to establish whether the

3593
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:49,440
system was chaotic or not because we

3594
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,360
found that the hessian

3595
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,040
approximation

3596
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:56,560
gave us a leopard if estimate that was

3597
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:59,440
like the actual leopardive exponent in

3598
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:02,560
the lorenz system so we could go from

3599
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,800
empirical covariances which people do

3600
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:07,599
literally every day cov open parentheses

3601
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:08,480
and r

3602
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,639
empirical covariances

3603
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:11,440
two

3604
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,840
estimated

3605
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,880
hessians two

3606
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,880
estimates of things like the lyapuniv

3607
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,639
exponents

3608
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:20,079
and that's why people often study

3609
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:22,960
chaotic systems in the super toy models

3610
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,800
like the double pendulum and lorenz

3611
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,800
because it turns out it's shockingly

3612
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,760
hard to find chaotic systems in nature

3613
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:33,199
outside of those toy examples because

3614
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:36,159
the real noise in the system swamps your

3615
02:10:36,159 --> 02:10:37,360
signal

3616
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,520
and so in conclusion

3617
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,360
having a simple functional form for the

3618
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,360
flow of random dynamical systems may be

3619
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:45,199
useful for modeling and analyzing time

3620
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:46,159
series

3621
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,079
generated by real-world processes that

3622
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:50,480
are far from equilibrium and may or may

3623
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,119
not be chaotic and so that's the closing

3624
02:10:53,119 --> 02:10:54,800
question

3625
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,639
human flow

3626
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:58,719
physical flow supply chains information

3627
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:01,520
flow narrative flow semantic flow

3628
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,599
ants bringing seeds in and taking the

3629
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:06,000
mid and out all of these flows

3630
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,159
we have data sets for them

3631
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,880
and now we have a new kind of model that

3632
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,360
we can use to model those flows

3633
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,440
so we'll just chill and talk for a few

3634
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:18,159
more minutes but what a great discussion

3635
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:20,079
so thanks a lot dean and steven and

3636
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:22,800
everybody else who participated in 32.

3637
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,840
so stephen first

3638
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:29,119
deep breath

3639
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:31,599
yeah i i i there was a couple of things

3640
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:34,800
there that seems to have a big impact um

3641
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,960
because

3642
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,599
as well as markovian monism and the idea

3643
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,199
that active inference brings in this um

3644
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:45,199
this this this partitioning and the the

3645
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:47,040
active inference field

3646
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,960
um which can then also have

3647
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,719
relationships to deep learning and how

3648
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:52,639
predictive processes thought about

3649
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,719
what's being said here that there's also

3650
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:59,840
evincing or evidence the idea of the

3651
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:04,159
evidence and statistic chaos

3652
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:08,480
itself also been a paradigm

3653
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,320
a paradigmatic

3654
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:11,199
uh

3655
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:12,480
part of

3656
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,880
evidence in being arrived being being

3657
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,320
arrived at

3658
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,599
so

3659
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:19,920
which in some ways is not dependent

3660
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,800
purely on markovian monism being

3661
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,800
the the the overarching game in town

3662
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,159
so that is quite a um

3663
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:32,880
that's quite an interesting additional

3664
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,119
way for

3665
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:36,400
deep

3666
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,079
learning

3667
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:38,800
to

3668
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:41,599
be um

3669
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:43,920
to be impacted by

3670
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,440
is this a field of practice is it a

3671
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,360
domain i don't know what we call it but

3672
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:49,119
the that that does

3673
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:51,679
it does it does make everything

3674
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:54,079
does it doesn't mean it's all markovian

3675
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:55,199
monism

3676
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:58,000
in terms of the ability to then infer

3677
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,320
you've also got this other

3678
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:03,119
um ability to

3679
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:04,320
get

3680
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,159
information and from what you're saying

3681
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:08,239
it almost as much by inferring if there

3682
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:09,840
is chaotic

3683
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,320
presence or if there's not maybe not

3684
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,239
having maybe going and seeing if there's

3685
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:15,199
not

3686
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:16,800
chaos present

3687
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,280
may give an idea of there's maybe no

3688
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:21,119
correlations present and that's that's

3689
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,040
to jump in the gun but you know maybe

3690
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:26,800
there's other ways of being able to

3691
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,520
interrogate statistical dependencies in

3692
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,840
time series analysis

3693
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,400
that can be sitting alongside

3694
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:38,079
the markovian monism

3695
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,199
so how that's connected to mycovian

3696
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:44,159
monism is definitely a good question but

3697
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:45,199
yes

3698
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:47,440
these are general tools for complex

3699
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,520
systems analysis so

3700
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,520
i hope people don't read this paper as

3701
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,320
like fristen apologetics or some sort of

3702
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,159
fringe development

3703
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:59,280
in act imp only it's pretty clear from

3704
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:01,760
the nouns that we used that this is

3705
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,440
actually like a fundamental contribution

3706
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:06,560
towards analyzing dynamical stochastic

3707
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:10,639
chaotic systems however just because

3708
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:13,440
you find for example a lowly operative

3709
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,760
exponent of your approximation

3710
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,639
it's not a statement about the system

3711
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:21,679
so we will always be able to just

3712
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:23,360
halt right there you know it's not that

3713
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,960
it's not a chaotic system

3714
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,400
your approximation

3715
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,880
doesn't have a chaotic leading lyapunov

3716
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,199
exponent

3717
02:14:31,199 --> 02:14:32,560
so say what you want to say about your

3718
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:35,360
map now if your map isn't chaotic

3719
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,440
and you're doing a great job

3720
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,360
predicting explaining controlling

3721
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,119
designing creating

3722
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:42,639
wonderful i hope the business is

3723
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:44,079
successful and that you can you know

3724
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:45,760
have friendship and health and all those

3725
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,760
things but that's not a claim about the

3726
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,840
territory and so there's going to be so

3727
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,679
many fun ways to talk and explore that

3728
02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:54,400
dean

3729
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,639
what are your closing thoughts

3730
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:58,800
just real quick i think

3731
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,440
what the co-variation piece which is

3732
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,679
basically statistics and an abstraction

3733
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,679
to to sort of explain things

3734
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:07,119
points out is that

3735
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:09,040
if we can understand

3736
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:11,599
the world as being both within

3737
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:12,719
enveloped

3738
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:16,639
and between partitioned at the same time

3739
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:18,719
that's a good fundamental place to start

3740
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:20,400
and i completely agree with your last

3741
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:23,199
statement we're not

3742
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:26,000
we're not counting fairies on pins

3743
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,599
and then just leaving it there we're

3744
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:29,119
actually hoping at some point to be able

3745
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:31,440
to turn this into something useful and

3746
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,360
functional but if you can't if you can't

3747
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,119
start from a place of seeing it as two

3748
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:38,079
things at once within in between

3749
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:39,520
you're going to struggle

3750
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,639
you're going to tend to collapse

3751
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,719
prematurely and you're not going to get

3752
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:46,880
very creative and active inference will

3753
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,480
well you'll be able to define it and

3754
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,040
describe it but i'm not sure how how

3755
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,840
much

3756
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,920
new information you'll be able to derive

3757
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:56,560
with it unless you can hold up both at

3758
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:00,159
once it's within in between

3759
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,079
great there's so much more that we

3760
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:08,719
all have to learn the appendices the

3761
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:10,639
formalisms we didn't go into the

3762
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:12,159
citations

3763
02:16:12,159 --> 02:16:14,320
other perspectives

3764
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,840
you know it's just the beginning and

3765
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:18,960
that's what dot two is about like

3766
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,280
how far we've come you know when we can

3767
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,639
go back to our road map and just be like

3768
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:27,440
wait dynamical systems and densities and

3769
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,440
then we're you know

3770
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:32,718
300 miles past there but

3771
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:34,318
where have we gotten

3772
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:35,679
and so it's like

3773
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:37,679
just really exciting and i'm glad that

3774
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:38,398
we're

3775
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:41,679
doing it in a participatory way because

3776
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:44,000
there's a lot to it so

3777
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,679
dean and steven thank you again

3778
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:47,760
everybody watching live and in replay

3779
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,920
hope that you get involved and stay

3780
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:54,558
involved with actin flap see you later

3781
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:57,638
bye

3782
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:05,599
you
