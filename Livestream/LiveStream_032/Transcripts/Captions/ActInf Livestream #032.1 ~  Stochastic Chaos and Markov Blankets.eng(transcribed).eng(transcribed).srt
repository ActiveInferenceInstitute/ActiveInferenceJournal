00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
welcome to the active inference lab

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,640
we are a participatory online lab that

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
is learning

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,199
communicating

10
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,520
and practicing applied active inference

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
you can find us at some of the links

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
here on this slide

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
this is a recorded and an archived live

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
stream so please provide us with

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
feedback so that we can improve on our

16
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,320
work

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
welcome here and we'll be following good

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
video etiquette for live streams

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
at this short link you can see some of

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,400
the past present and upcoming live

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,119
streams we are here in the early

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
november 2021

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
32 discussions

25
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,159
on stochastic chaos and markov blankets

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
and in the second half of november we'll

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
be talking about the paper thinking like

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a state and we haven't yet set the

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,960
papers for 34 and 35 so if you have any

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,040
ideas or if you're an author you want to

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,479
come on to discuss

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
for these states

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
then get in touch with us

34
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,119
today in active stream 32.1 the goal is

35
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,000
to learn and discuss this extremely

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
interesting paper stochastic chaos and

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
markov blankets by fristen heinz oltofer

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
decosta and par from 2021

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,079
and there's a lot to cover in this paper

40
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
there's a lot of formalisms and figures

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
and keywords and

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,599
broader questions so i'm sure we'll have

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
a lot to think about and discuss

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
if you're watching live then please feel

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
free to write a question in the chat

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
because otherwise stephen and i are just

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
chilling here

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
so

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
let's get into it um with uh just intros

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
and warm-ups and if others join we'll

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
have them introduce themselves when they

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
do join but for now let's just um say

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
hello and maybe bring up just um

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
something that excited us about coming

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,519
to this discussion or something that we

56
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
wanted to resolve today

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
so

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,840
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
california and something that i liked or

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
remembered about the paper was that

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
there was

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
seemingly some changes

63
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,319
or updates to the formalism

64
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
of core terms

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,360
and so how to understand that in the

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
broader trajectory of the literature

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,319
which one of these changes are like

68
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
updates where is it a software update

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
where is it a breaking change and then

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,239
what are the implications of those

71
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,800
changes for some of the broader

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
conclusions that people do or want to

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,080
draw from active inference and the fep

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
like the nature of thingness or

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,720
biological systems or levels of nested

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
organization

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,599
so stephen

78
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
yes uh good morning from toronto um i'm

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
stephen i'm

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
um i'm doing a practice based phd which

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,959
is kind of moves into a methods based

82
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
phd

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
i work a lot with

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
group processes and working with spatial

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
creative spatial approaches

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,080
to help do sense making

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,519
so i'm really interested in active

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
inference within that as a as a kind of

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
unifying way to help to

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
close a lot of the loops and the

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
fragmented

92
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
uh questions that come up when trying to

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,840
do sense making with different types of

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
people in different types of spaces so

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
um

96
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
yeah and as with daniel i'm really

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
interested about this paper

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
um as

99
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
after the initial

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
view of it because you see stochastic

101
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,440
chaos and

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
i'm consciously trying to not go too far

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,479
down

104
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
sort of an abstract academic aspect of

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,680
things

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
um

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
but i realized that actually these

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
underlying processes have got quite a

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
lot of applications

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,520
in this ability to understand why and

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
how things are unifying um

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,840
and i think that's really exciting um

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
because there's a lot of sort of

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
semi-markovian

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,080
like looks at larger cognitive processes

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
there's certain

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,560
practices and inactivist processes

118
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
um but what we tend to see when it gets

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,800
down into the nitty-gritty is it's it's

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
how

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
are things bubbling up through um the

122
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
kind of stochastic

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
chaos of of the world and life um

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,039
or should i just say stochastic

125
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,680
separated chaotic

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
processes and so the idea of having

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,759
stochastic chaos and what that means and

128
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
this paper does that

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
is quite useful to

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
start to look at what it means to have

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,680
to be able to reconcile those approaches

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,479
so

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
it actually does start to help think

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
about more applied approaches so that's

135
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280
something i'm i'm interested and excited

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
about this paper

137
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
thank you stephen

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
in the

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
32.0

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,759
this is kind of

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,000
the lead-in was this topic of flow

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
and that is in a way what might start to

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
bridge this distinction that you raised

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
and will definitely return to between

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
kind of abstractions and applications

146
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
flow is a term that has

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
applications across domains from the

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
flow of water flow of people flow of

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
information and money to psychological

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,759
flow it's kind of a nomadic term it's a

151
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,319
transdisciplinary term

152
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,360
and then

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
that's an abstraction we're abstracting

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,960
to the patterns of flow

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
that help us connect the dots across

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
these different systems but also we want

157
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
to apply it we don't just want to say

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
well waters flow and information is flow

159
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
and that's the end of the story

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
so

161
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
how abstractions and applications

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
kind of work like the left and the right

163
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,319
foot

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,400
together to

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,919
build our knowledge and our application

166
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
almost like our epistemic and our

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
pragmatic value i think that'll be a

168
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,880
thread that's important to um

169
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
pull out what do you think about

170
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,319
that yeah that's a really helpful

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
connection

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
and i think this also speaks to that

173
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
usefulness of this

174
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,360
work beyond

175
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,639
modeling

176
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,360
directly is when when this idea of flow

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
is talked about in in these ways it's

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
kind of a bit vague right it's kind of

179
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
um and it still has this idea of things

180
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
flowing in a certain direction

181
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
um and are you in the flow and so i

182
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
think when we start to also have the

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
potentials for stochastic

184
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
processes and in a way the sense that

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,720
everything's flow um and you know how

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,599
does

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,560
what does low and high requirements mean

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
you know what does low and high

189
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
competencies preferences mean

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
and they kind of these are quite

191
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
bucket terms right and um essentially

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
they they are what they are because they

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,639
are workable

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,000
truth be told

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
but you know we can start to

196
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
look for something which can hold those

197
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
in a more unified way um

198
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
because i think that

199
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,879
um the way that we might feel in the

200
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
flow when we're in a zone

201
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
where we can both do things and we're

202
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
immersed in it

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
um

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
may may well be um

205
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
maybe what we're in all the time anyway

206
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
but it's just a different form of

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
um so that that also

208
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
changes you know the kind of

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
ramifications out there

210
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,919
great

211
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,799
point and we can actually um connect

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,640
that to this sort of view from the

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
outside and view from the inside which

214
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
we talk about a lot in active so it's

215
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
almost like there's the skier going down

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
the hill

217
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
and the view from the outside the

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,440
behavioral view is like

219
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
given the angle of the hill

220
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
they're optimally flowing that river is

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
physically optimally flowing down that

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
hill as you'd expect from the friction

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
and the potential energy and just the

224
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
physics of the setup

225
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
and then there's this

226
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
internal experience of flow so it's kind

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,399
of like

228
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
um maybe we are inflow all the time even

229
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
when we are getting for example

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
distracted or bored or frustrated

231
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
in what ways is that still flow

232
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
because if we think about flow well

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
flow's good you know um it's a state

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
where we're productive and happy and

235
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
things like that and then we're out of

236
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
flow that's what you'd hear in the

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
psychological literature

238
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
but let's just say that the river

239
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
we're flowing

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
and flooding

241
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
we don't say well we're done using flow

242
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
models because now it doesn't do what i

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
thought it was going to do

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,880
flow

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
is the whole space

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
so how do we think about this whole

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
psychological space

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
as being

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
particular regimes of flow

250
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
and flows the big topic that connects

251
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
stress

252
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
fear failing overwhelm concern

253
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
excitation etc

254
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
those are all flow states

255
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
maybe it's not the flow state that we

256
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
expect maybe not the one that we prefer

257
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
but a river can have flow states that we

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
don't expect or prefer either and so

259
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
it's like when we do abstract to the

260
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
physical systems we get a whole

261
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
quantitative toolkit

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,560
and we also get the ability to

263
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
maybe look beyond

264
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
phrasings that see flow as just

265
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
something to be obtained and rather flow

266
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
as the nature of

267
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
perhaps interior experience and then we

268
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
can talk about designing or perturbing

269
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
regimes of flow yeah go ahead

270
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
yeah that's a good point um

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
because from the out there's the outside

272
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
system like say seeing someone skiing

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
down a hill and you could say there's

274
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,560
different

275
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
ways of doing that and then as from the

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
inside

277
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,320
you've got essentially

278
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
a dynamic non-linear dynamical

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
organism

280
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
that's kind of trying to sort of thrive

281
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
and survive

282
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
and it's it's different there's no

283
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
getting away from that and um

284
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
the nature of that difference is

285
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
that's that's another question beyond

286
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
but

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
the the the interesting thing is on that

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
graph as well is often that graph only

289
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
that the flow is only shown on the top

290
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
right and not on the bottom left even

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
though it could be seen to flow down

292
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
and and um so something that's like a

293
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
quadrant and it's just the top right

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
which is seen as the flow

295
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,439
but what's also interesting is

296
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
it kind of depends again on these

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,240
multi-scale dynamics okay so

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
within certain scales of and temporal

299
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
scales

300
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
things start to fit our

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
our our

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
organism's preferred states

303
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,399
um some of which is kind of built into

304
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,880
our

305
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
morphology

306
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,519
so

307
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,079
you know if something becomes so easy

308
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
for instance

309
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
it's a lot easier if i'm trying to

310
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
protect a building just to stand in

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
front of the front door as a security

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
guard and nothing happens all day

313
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
but

314
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
and i may end up in some sort of flow

315
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
but there's a point at which

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,560
um

317
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
there's a desire for some stimulation

318
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,279
there's a desire for some change

319
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
and there's also maybe

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
changes that happen at the kind of

321
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
this sort of ties in with with um

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,360
saffron adam saffron's work about

323
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
you know windows of experience both in

324
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,880
real time and over time is

325
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,720
when is it kind of in the same sort of

326
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,279
time scales that we consciously function

327
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,079
in

328
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
um and when is something

329
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
beyond that you know so that could be

330
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
where stress and boredom or stress and

331
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
burnout can be both because the nature

332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
of the activity

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
is is too rapid it's too disjointed for

334
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
the

335
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
our morphology

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
uh or it may be that we perceive it that

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
way because we have some

338
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
you know depressive depression or

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
anxiety that's also not enabling us to

340
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
engage in those ways

341
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
what's your thoughts

342
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
great let's take that point to one of

343
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,399
the formalisms of the paper so you just

344
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
mentioned how there's like multiple

345
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
time scales and there might be slower

346
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
time scales as well as faster ones which

347
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
might even be faster than our rate of

348
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
perception or modeling

349
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
which are one in the same if perception

350
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
is indeed a generative model

351
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
and this is very early in the paper in

352
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,079
section 2 from dynamics to densities so

353
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,320
they write the aim of this section is to

354
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
get from the specification of a random

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,720
dynamical system in terms of its

356
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
equations of motion

357
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
so the

358
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
for example differential equations that

359
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
define the time evolution of a dynamical

360
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,839
system

361
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
two the probability density over its

362
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
states in the long term future from any

363
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
initial conditions so going from

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,560
dynamical systems which takes us um into

365
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,320
the temporal realm

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
to the density realm and so there we

367
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,600
think about ocean water of different

368
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
physical densities

369
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,519
there's

370
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,959
a motion

371
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,600
to the densities because denser things

372
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
go down

373
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
and so that idea of denser things going

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
down or flow

375
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,880
from high to low density regions just

376
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,399
like in the atmosphere just like in the

377
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
ocean

378
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
that is going to be connected to

379
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,800
the behavior of

380
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
random dynamical systems

381
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
and to

382
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,760
information geometry so that's

383
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
a little bit of the next piece but

384
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
the two time scales are here

385
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,360
here's a classic flow model there's a

386
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
flow and then there's the fast

387
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,279
fluctuations so it's like there's the

388
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,519
river moving ahead at you know one

389
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,199
kilometer per hour

390
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,519
but each molecule

391
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
in that river is not always going at

392
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,320
exactly that speed rate

393
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
there's a fast fluctuation which might

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
average out to zero so in the bulk

395
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
aggregate or in the time aggregate

396
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
the flow

397
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,560
dominates the behavior of the river

398
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,839
but the fast fluctuations are also

399
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,079
occurring and they can often be

400
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,040
equivalent to a well-behaved i.e

401
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
gaussian error term

402
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
so this is where we see

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,519
the separation of time scales into sort

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,160
of the flow of the river and then the

405
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,959
vibration of the molecules

406
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
and those have two different

407
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,440
partitionings of

408
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
the system

409
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
the flow is well behaved because it is

410
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
just like a single number for the whole

411
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,120
river

412
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,560
in this simple example

413
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,920
and the fast fluctuations are well

414
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,759
behaved because they're

415
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
smaller if they were larger than the

416
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,759
flow they would become the flow itself

417
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
so they're smaller than the flow

418
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,639
and

419
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
they might be uncorrelated or have a

420
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
zero mean which allows us to do

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
gaussian statistics on them and then

422
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
this idea of

423
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
separation into slow and fast time

424
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
scales

425
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,040
is connected to density dynamics

426
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,199
through the focker planck equation yeah

427
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,599
stephen

428
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,759
yeah just

429
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
a little question on that so you the the

430
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
the the this time dynamic so flow

431
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,079
is both

432
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
at the time scale of interest i suppose

433
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
you could say

434
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
and potentially one which has a a net

435
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,959
kind of change in some sort of

436
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,959
directional kind of

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,600
gradient descent i suppose

438
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
and then

439
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,880
the fast fluctuations

440
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,959
it doesn't say random but it's probably

441
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,040
more stochastic um

442
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
but could also have flows going on so is

443
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
this um

444
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
is this is this um

445
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,679
you know how how much difference in in

446
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
the in the rate that they need to be to

447
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
be classed as

448
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,359
good low and fast good question

449
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,720
um so

450
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,599
the x with a dot is kind of like the

451
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,679
derivative of x it's the rate of change

452
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
in x it's the flow in x is going to be

453
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,199
decomposed

454
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
to these two terms

455
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,640
now we might be interested in a very

456
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
special solution to this equation

457
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,760
so again we have um x dot is kind of the

458
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,679
change in x which is being broken down

459
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
to these two dynamical

460
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
variables and then that's being

461
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
equivalent to the focker plank which is

462
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
more of a density framing so that's the

463
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,679
key

464
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
introductory step in the paper is just

465
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
to build this really strong equivalence

466
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
aka they're the same picture between

467
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
the dynamical specification and the

468
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,400
density specification

469
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
so if we could solve when the dynamics

470
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
were at a steady point that would be

471
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,880
equivalent to when the density would be

472
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
at a steady point

473
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
there might be some methods to help

474
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,080
solve it in one

475
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
phrasing or the other phrasing

476
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,120
it turns out that there's a

477
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,240
way to solve with a little bit more

478
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
feasibility when p of x equals zero so

479
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
that's when the flow

480
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
the density flow

481
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,200
given this is zero

482
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,919
and so that's what they're discussing

483
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,200
here

484
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
is um

485
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
basically

486
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
asking when does that equal zero

487
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,640
and that is a stationary point

488
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
so it's kind of like

489
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
doesn't mean it's just simply flat

490
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
in the reservoir but you know there's a

491
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
pump bringing water up to the reservoir

492
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
at 10 gallons per minute and then the

493
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,520
reservoir is dumping at 10 gallons per

494
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
minute

495
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
then that is going to be a point where

496
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
there's a stationarity

497
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,440
in the overall

498
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
densities of those two bodies of water

499
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
just like if it were two bodies of heat

500
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
and so we're solving for a special

501
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
place which is where the total flow rate

502
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
is zero

503
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
can i just ask a question from that

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
without going too deep but

505
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,400
so

506
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,919
in a way the the the flows the purp the

507
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,679
ability of having this

508
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,760
relationship to the flow

509
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,679
is it gives it gives you a sense i

510
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,200
suppose you could say it's like when the

511
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
graph the the gradient zero you know

512
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,720
that the top of a graph between two

513
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,919
types of

514
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
descent and it's

515
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,799
it's got like that that flat gradient

516
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
um it gives you a chance to

517
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
choose moments which could have a

518
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
particular

519
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
um set of properties without having to

520
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
calculate everything about it it's just

521
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,640
and

522
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,280
now when that happens what happens then

523
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,799
is it then that you then measure the

524
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,480
density and just keep measuring lots of

525
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,799
density points when you find the flow

526
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
points to be it

527
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
at a state of equilibrium or is there

528
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,480
something else so very good question

529
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
taking samples

530
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
and using that to say something about

531
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
the landscape is something we are going

532
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,559
to get to

533
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,000
welcome dean

534
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,120
so we will talk about how samples can be

535
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,400
empirically taken to say things

536
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,080
and do inference on the flow density

537
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
um

538
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
but you you made a good point which is

539
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
that like we want to figure out

540
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
something about a special point like

541
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,919
let's just say that we knew that we were

542
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
solving for a quadratic equation which

543
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
is going to come into play later so it

544
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
is going to look like a bowl

545
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
now it'd be awesome to know every single

546
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,039
point on the whole bowl

547
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
but it turns out we might only be

548
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
interested or mostly interested in

549
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,080
one point the bottom of the bowl

550
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
and for a quadratic function

551
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
the bottom of the bowl is the only time

552
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,840
that the derivative is zero

553
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,240
so we can have this big nasty quadratic

554
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
equation

555
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,799
and then

556
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,480
take the derivative of it the first

557
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,600
derivative

558
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,039
and then just ask

559
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
when does the first derivative

560
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
the slope of the curve equal zero

561
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
and we know that for a quadratic

562
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
equation there's only one point where

563
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,360
that happens and either it's like a bowl

564
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,679
or it's like an upside down bowl but

565
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,000
because we constrained the discussion to

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
a specific

567
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
family of equations which is going to be

568
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,760
important for variational inference

569
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,880
we can then

570
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,039
solve some very reduced

571
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,360
equations like the derivative which is

572
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
of a lower order of computational

573
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,200
complexity

574
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
and then just get the one point that we

575
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
actually wanted which is like the

576
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,240
location

577
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,159
of the bottom of the bowl

578
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
and then from the bottom of the bowl and

579
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
some of the coefficient estimates that

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,039
we have

581
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,679
we actually do get the whole bowl

582
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
so this is kind of like we're taking

583
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
some big family

584
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
of

585
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,159
equations

586
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,600
and then we're going to be looking for

587
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
special points like especially where the

588
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,080
flow is at equilibrium or stationarity

589
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
and then

590
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
fitting

591
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
a family of equations

592
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
with a form that we know we can compute

593
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,600
with

594
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,559
to

595
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,559
approximate

596
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,840
a flow that has a different underlying

597
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,679
dynamic and that is going to come into

598
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,440
play where

599
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
they show very early you can take a

600
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
lorenz attractor

601
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,720
which has some equations that govern its

602
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,280
motion so again those can be moved from

603
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
the equations of motion to the density

604
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,559
dynamics

605
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,919
and then you can reconstruct

606
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,200
an approximation of its dynamics

607
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,080
and your approximation to the dynamics

608
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
doesn't have to be even of the same form

609
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
as the generative process itself so it's

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,679
like you could fit a linear model

611
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,679
between height and weight

612
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
with some error

613
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
but that doesn't mean that there is a

614
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
linear model relating height and weight

615
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
it just means it's an approximation

616
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
heuristic with a form that's very easy

617
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,840
to solve

618
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,679
stephen and then welcome dean feel free

619
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
to add anything you'd like

620
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
so so in some ways this is a bit like

621
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,960
that particle wave challenge whereby

622
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
you know you have to use a particle to

623
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
find where something is in time and

624
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
space you have to just use a very

625
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
simplified

626
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,720
um understanding of the of the wave

627
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
to say okay at this point i have to i

628
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,280
can't

629
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
i can't have all that other information

630
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
but to have my location information

631
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
even if it's an informational location

632
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,400
so it's like that the flow

633
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,559
finding a point in the flow gives you a

634
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,880
way to identify

635
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,960
the

636
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,760
location maybe in the information space

637
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,240
and then the the foca plank

638
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
gives you a way to then

639
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
embellish that with another type of you

640
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
know put information back in

641
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
in a way

642
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
back into the into the

643
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
cake mix put a bit more

644
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
uh you know a bit more salt and a few

645
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,080
more uh chocolate uh

646
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
chocolate buttons in there and uh so you

647
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
can see what's going on um

648
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
okay that that's quite useful to think

649
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
about that would i be right in the sense

650
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,600
of like what those two equations are

651
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
doing one's

652
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
giving you

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,799
okay

654
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,320
some

655
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,360
chance to

656
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
to choose a

657
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,120
moment in information space or physical

658
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,039
space so at least you've got something

659
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,159
and then the other one's giving you a

660
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,400
way to then put some information which

661
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
you can then start to do some

662
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
variational processing on

663
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,559
i'll give a short thought and then dean

664
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,720
and blue feel free to say hello and um

665
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
just any overall thoughts and take it

666
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
wherever you want to go um

667
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
most

668
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
dynamical systems

669
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,679
have been framed classically

670
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
using these equations of motion so you

671
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
get like a matrix that describes the

672
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
differential equations

673
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,640
that describe the unfolding of the

674
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,279
lorenz attractor so it's framed as a

675
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,600
series of dynamical equations so this

676
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,360
early equivalence

677
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,000
allows us to bring some of the tools

678
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
of

679
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,679
fluid mechanics

680
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,400
and density dynamics and flow

681
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,679
to bear

682
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,640
on

683
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
these dynamical

684
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,559
systems

685
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
so there are some

686
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
ingredients or some

687
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
kitchen tools

688
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
that make

689
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,039
approximations to flow

690
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
very useful

691
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,919
for equations of motion that might be

692
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,760
intractable if you try to solve it on

693
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
just that domain

694
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
like figuring out

695
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
a chaotic system's underlying generative

696
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,799
process

697
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
it's basically

698
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
not possible

699
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
but potentially by approximating it

700
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,120
with a very specific type of

701
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
approximation families of functions that

702
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
we know have certain behaviors which

703
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400
we're going to talk more about

704
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
using approximation families that are

705
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
well behaved

706
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,440
and

707
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,679
using some of the things

708
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,679
that have been developed from flow

709
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,120
decomposition like the helmholtz

710
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
decomposition

711
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,520
that doesn't exist for dynamical systems

712
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
so by making that equivalence between

713
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,159
dynamical systems and flowing systems

714
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
we can then use

715
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
flow

716
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
tools

717
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
to study

718
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
dynamical systems

719
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,799
as well as making it clear that we're

720
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,240
describing

721
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,440
the flow of our approximation

722
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
but it turns out that that does pretty

723
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
well at least in some of these examples

724
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,919
that they're going to present in the

725
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,880
paper

726
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,679
so

727
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,120
um dean and then blue

728
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
hi i'm dean i wasn't going to come on

729
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
today but

730
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
the conversation was stimulating enough

731
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,919
i figured i had to

732
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,840
jump in here and and

733
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,679
maybe add my two cents at some point

734
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,480
thanks

735
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,159
and blue

736
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
hi i'm blue i'm a research assistant in

737
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,440
new mexico and um

738
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,679
i yeah was into this paper because it uh

739
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
i don't know kind of

740
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
um piqued my interest in information

741
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,679
geometry and daniel i saw like in the

742
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,760
dot zero that you had mentioned that

743
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
course that's online i'm like gonna look

744
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,799
into that for sure

745
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,600
um

746
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,320
and you know i i'm curious about like a

747
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
lot of the leaps that were maybe made in

748
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
this paper between like

749
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,159
particles from particles to cells and

750
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
back to particles again and those kinds

751
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,880
of transitions get a little fuzzy for me

752
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
so i'm curious to see kind of where this

753
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
flows to

754
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,360
yep i think that was the information

755
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
geometry

756
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,600
course of john baez so that's like

757
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,360
again i haven't taken that but i know

758
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,960
that that's recommended and very cool

759
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,159
um

760
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
so we talked a little bit about

761
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,679
flow about that's kind of one of the

762
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
dreams that we could have a unified flow

763
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,559
model for heat and people information

764
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,080
behavior strategy etc

765
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,399
and one of the earliest moves that they

766
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,840
do in the paper

767
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
is just to really lock down this

768
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
connection between dynamical systems

769
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
systems through time and systems with

770
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
density so it's worth just repeating

771
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
that because that's

772
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
the second section of the paper and

773
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,919
that's going to be a lot of the build-up

774
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,279
another

775
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
term that comes into play

776
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,240
um is the leopardive exponent and

777
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
chaotic systems

778
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,799
so

779
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,880
if anyone has a thought of course just

780
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,679
raise your hand but one way that chaotic

781
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,559
is

782
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,720
quantified and formalized this doesn't

783
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,399
mean it's the only sense of the word

784
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,399
chaotic because sometimes people do use

785
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760
it non-technically but the technical

786
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
definition of chaotic is referring to

787
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
the extent of the sensitivity of the

788
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
system to small changes for example in

789
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,520
initial conditions or in perturbations

790
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
and so there's

791
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
what's known as a leoponif exponent

792
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,440
which is something that can be

793
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
calculated from

794
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,399
the model of a dynamical system

795
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,399
and there are some dynamical systems

796
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,760
where

797
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,279
adjacent points

798
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,600
stay adjacent so it's like two pieces of

799
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,039
wood that are just put in a river that's

800
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,880
moving straight forward there's other

801
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
systems where adjacent points converge

802
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,919
or where adjacent points diverge and it

803
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,760
depends where you are in the system like

804
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,919
if you're at the bottom of the bowl

805
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,360
then

806
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
the either way you go it's like a stable

807
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,480
equilibrium you're going to get pushed

808
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
back in

809
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,080
but if the bowl were upside down then

810
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,279
either

811
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,279
point to the side of the top of the bowl

812
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,399
would push you and diverge so that's the

813
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
leopard exponent

814
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,159
and

815
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,440
there's

816
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,640
a lot of technical detail in exploring

817
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
chaotic systems from this perspective

818
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,520
so that's one

819
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
matrix

820
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
um term that comes into play is using

821
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,520
the leopardive exponents

822
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,600
especially the leading leopardive

823
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,720
exponents

824
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
to characterize some of the attributes

825
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,840
of a system

826
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,559
steven

827
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,200
i think it's good to mention that idea

828
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
of a system you know like two things

829
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
coming together and when they can meet

830
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
you know the system as well they can

831
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,760
converge or they diverge

832
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
but they could also when they bump into

833
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
each other there's also that

834
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,279
the the dynamics of the system

835
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,440
so as well as the of the system's

836
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
dynamics

837
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,399
merging the dynamics of the the change

838
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,799
it will stop changing once they meet

839
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
right so that there's also the extra

840
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
level of

841
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
dynamical change which you get with

842
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,679
these non-linear dynamical systems

843
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,960
which are actually working with the

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
dynamics of the change so it can sort of

845
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
reset itself it's not like with once

846
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
they've in a physical system they've

847
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,480
come together that's kind of it when

848
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,159
you're dealing with variations on change

849
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,440
it becomes much more generative

850
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,480
okay yes so sometimes these exquisite

851
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,039
sensitivities to tiny tiny differences

852
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
in initial conditions

853
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,000
they get swamped by random fluctuations

854
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
so

855
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
um

856
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,039
that's what's interesting about their

857
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,880
approach here is again they're

858
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,120
partitioning out the flow from the fast

859
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
fluctuations

860
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,360
and then they're describing how

861
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
when re when random fluctuations are

862
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,120
added in

863
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,159
then

864
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,120
the strange attractor is going to be

865
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,760
retraced by uh replaced by a pullback

866
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,360
attractor

867
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
and then the flow is the expected motion

868
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
so that's the movement of the river

869
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
of the flow

870
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,960
term

871
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,799
if this flow shows exponential

872
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
divergence of trajectories i.e

873
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,519
positively operative exponents we can

874
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,200
impute stochastic chaos

875
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,039
they

876
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:11,840
then

877
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
use

878
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,960
this approach to investigate one of the

879
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,480
classic

880
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,519
chaotic systems which has also been one

881
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,600
of the earliest chaotic systems of

882
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,039
lorenz

883
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,480
who

884
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
maybe there was some other livestream

885
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,600
where we did a little bit more on the

886
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,760
lorenz but it was a

887
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
meteorology question

888
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
lorenz and colleagues were studying the

889
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,600
weather

890
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
and how it changes and about some of the

891
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,960
sensitivity

892
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,480
of the dynamical models to tiny changes

893
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,840
like it seems like if it's you know 21.1

894
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,799
c

895
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,120
it seems like that should be very

896
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,440
similar in its behavior in the long run

897
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
to it being just 0.1 degree higher

898
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,799
and then as you got further away it's

899
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,159
like well then it'd be way more

900
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,000
different in the future if it's more

901
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
different today but then

902
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
it could actually turn out that a tiny

903
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
difference ends up sending your

904
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,919
equations haywire whereas a very

905
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,679
different initial condition

906
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
might actually like feed back and come

907
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,600
back to a similar attractor through time

908
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,039
so that's the kind of systems that they

909
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,760
were investigating in like the 1950s

910
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,720
and

911
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,519
there's been a lot of computer and

912
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,919
technical work since then but this is

913
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,760
still a total classic

914
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,399
and a beautiful strange attractor for

915
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
them to be working on as the first

916
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,159
example in their paper stephen

917
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,880
so what you're saying the the the

918
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
strange attractor is the kind of

919
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,559
complexity science idea of these

920
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,399
mathematical models where things get

921
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,640
caught in as you just described and

922
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,840
initial conditions

923
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,399
can can change the nature of what that

924
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,399
becomes within a certain range and

925
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,559
obviously outside that range it doesn't

926
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,320
it doesn't form so it's still kind of

927
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
off equilibrium

928
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,039
this pullback attractor

929
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,159
is a um

930
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,399
is is

931
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,280
a

932
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,879
almost a

933
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,599
a set of states which can be

934
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
moved towards

935
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,800
through

936
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,239
looking at the flows within

937
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,280
other types of chaotic attractors so it

938
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,119
is making a difference so it's

939
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,679
in some ways a strange attract sorry the

940
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,679
pullback attractor

941
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,839
would

942
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,480
or involve some sort of

943
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,239
inference or some sort of

944
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
some sort of driver to make it happen

945
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,800
it's not inherent to the to the

946
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
nature of the mathematics of that

947
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,639
particular

948
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,320
thing once you let it roll would i be

949
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,159
right in there

950
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,639
so the pull back attractor it's kind of

951
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,719
like let's just imagine the attractor is

952
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
like a post in the ground and there's a

953
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
bungee cord so if we were looking at

954
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
that quadratic bowl

955
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
it'd be like there's an attractor

956
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,200
at the bottom of the bowl and then

957
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,599
if all you saw was the

958
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
lateral movement of the particle so we

959
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
don't know anything about the height

960
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,119
necessarily or the shape of the graph

961
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,960
we just observe that when we push the

962
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
ball to the left

963
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,119
it gets pulled back as if it's being on

964
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,359
a bungee cord pulled left maybe it even

965
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,440
overshoots and it kind of dampens so

966
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,520
that's like a pullback attractor to a

967
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,320
point attractor

968
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
what's being shown here is an attractor

969
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,599
that is in higher dimensions so if you

970
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,520
had a two-dimensional pullback attractor

971
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
it'd be like the line y equals x and if

972
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,119
you get perturbed off the line you come

973
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
back down into the valley so that's like

974
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,599
where you start to see vector fields and

975
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
the flow of water into a river

976
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,119
and now

977
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,440
we're in a three-dimensional

978
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,760
attractor at least three

979
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
spatial dimensions

980
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
and so it's kind of like there's a race

981
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,480
car going around this butterfly track

982
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,320
and then it has the bungee cord so

983
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,040
you're getting pulled to this car

984
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
that's moving and then if you sample

985
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,680
your location at different times

986
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,079
you're being drawn to a pullback

987
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,359
attractor

988
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,320
which is the compromise between

989
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,839
the flow

990
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
as defined by

991
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,440
the equations of motions of the lorenz

992
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
attractor

993
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,520
and the fast stochastic fluctuations

994
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,839
dean and then

995
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,480
stephen

996
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,320
yeah just quickly i think this is why

997
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,240
sometimes using a

998
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,440
the the metaphor of building a bridge

999
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,079
is difficult because

1000
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,880
uh not all at not all times is as

1001
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
convenient as the lowest energy state in

1002
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,079
a bowl

1003
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,079
sometimes what we have to look at is the

1004
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,520
fact that

1005
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,880
at one end

1006
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,119
call it point a

1007
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,400
um

1008
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
we're trying to figure out

1009
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,440
what point b is and it isn't always the

1010
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
lowest energy state i think here's an

1011
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,000
example so if you ever if you've been to

1012
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
hudson yards in new york

1013
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,760
uh it's it's a fascinating translation

1014
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,280
of a space over time and it and if you

1015
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,119
were to ask the people who actually

1016
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,280
constructed those

1017
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,520
uh high trestles

1018
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
at the at the point that they were built

1019
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,920
if you did if you had asked them x

1020
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,640
number of years later whether or not

1021
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,880
that was going to be the lowest possible

1022
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,440
energy state or attractor state i don't

1023
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,839
think they could have predicted that

1024
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,520
and so that's why i think it's difficult

1025
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
at times when we

1026
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,599
for the sake of convenience for effort

1027
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,480
to expedite our sense of what's going to

1028
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,520
happen next we use a connector metaphor

1029
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
but in fact that's not exactly what

1030
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,119
stochastic

1031
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,839
possibility is about

1032
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,920
so what we tend to do is collapse down

1033
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,200
too quickly

1034
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,000
down to the particulars of what purpose

1035
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,079
a product can serve

1036
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,760
and if we're going to build a bridge

1037
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,240
from a product to a process which is

1038
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,359
what i think

1039
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,759
looking at stochastic

1040
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,520
separation is about

1041
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,119
we should maybe drop the idea of

1042
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,599
a static connector and maybe look at the

1043
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,079
back and forth and the actual dynamics

1044
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,839
of those dynamic

1045
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,960
situations which were now the tool

1046
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
of active inference affords

1047
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,720
cool interesting it just made me think

1048
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,400
about like throwing a frisbee and it

1049
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,839
catches on a roof

1050
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,480
that's its lowest local energy state but

1051
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,560
if you just thought about gravity maybe

1052
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
you'd say well it's going to fall to the

1053
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,200
ground so one particular trajectory

1054
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,320
may not

1055
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,440
realize

1056
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,560
the ultimate lowest energy state yet

1057
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,119
in a way it's in its own energy state

1058
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,839
so stephen

1059
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,760
yeah

1060
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,720
sort of thinking again about

1061
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
applications i think what dean mentions

1062
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,480
is a good point is

1063
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
there's an actual tendency to want to

1064
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,680
have that kind of

1065
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,480
bridge between two stable things

1066
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,720
the thing with two stable things is it

1067
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,760
is they're stable as we just mentioned

1068
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,880
so therefore if you're trying to get

1069
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,520
information about variations within them

1070
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,480
particularly chaotic variations you're

1071
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,800
not going to get much right so you you

1072
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
kind of need

1073
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,160
there's there's a need to be

1074
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,119
off

1075
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,960
out of equilibrium

1076
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,359
to to give the conditions where things

1077
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,760
can move in

1078
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,599
potentially a strange attractor or

1079
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,599
potentially other types of

1080
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,359
you know solenoidal flows or something

1081
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,040
there needs to be some way for flows to

1082
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
happen

1083
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,960
and then within that

1084
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,800
which i think that might explain why

1085
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,960
that last graph so if i'm if i'm right

1086
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
in thinking that those four graphs that

1087
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,000
you showed there

1088
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,599
are kind of showing

1089
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,599
that you've got this

1090
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,560
strange

1091
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,320
tract that you can sort of look at the

1092
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,079
state space using

1093
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,440
points

1094
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,320
of where something has become moment

1095
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,040
momentarily

1096
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
zero in the the flow calculation gives

1097
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,280
you a zero so you can therefore take a

1098
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
point

1099
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,440
and then the bottom right is basically

1100
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
saying you can recapitulate that

1101
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,920
as a global potential so you can sort of

1102
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,319
by taking the changes

1103
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,000
that happen in the second order you can

1104
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880
sort of recapitulate some kind of

1105
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,640
understanding of the structure of the

1106
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,839
information

1107
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,400
is that right

1108
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,400
there's

1109
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,040
a lot there it

1110
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,760
so i cannot reduce it to a binary but

1111
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
yes it is showing

1112
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,839
different aspects of how

1113
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,560
strange attractors which are

1114
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,880
found in these sort of exotic

1115
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,520
deterministic chaos systems

1116
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,480
like a perfectly clean double pendulum

1117
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,839
and then how when we take the

1118
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,280
approximation

1119
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,319
we find a pullback attractor empirically

1120
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,920
in

1121
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
the approximation

1122
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,640
so now we're describing a nicer still

1123
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,680
stochastic but much nicer and more

1124
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,400
approachable pull back attractor like

1125
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,640
it's being pulled back to some

1126
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,760
butterfly shape now we don't get these

1127
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
like rings of jupiter situation from our

1128
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,280
sampling because we're taking particular

1129
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,040
samples and were fitting then

1130
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,480
a flow what flow generated

1131
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,359
those samples so we never see

1132
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,599
rings of jupiter strange attractor we're

1133
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,680
dealing with approximations of random

1134
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,880
attractors

1135
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,160
and then

1136
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,960
we have at least two

1137
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,560
tools slash

1138
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,880
helpful techniques to apply

1139
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,119
that are going to help us come to terms

1140
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,000
with

1141
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,280
that

1142
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,560
approximation

1143
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
so one of them is we're dealing with

1144
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,359
flow

1145
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,119
so we can talk about the helmholtz

1146
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,359
decomposition so this was discussed a

1147
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
lot in active 26

1148
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,560
and as mentioned in the dot zero

1149
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
stochastic chaos in markov blankets was

1150
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,760
submitted like a few weeks after

1151
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,200
26 was submitted bayesian mechanics

1152
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,920
so

1153
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,200
um

1154
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
the helmholtz decomposition

1155
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,640
describes this partitioning into the

1156
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
irrotational kind of the gradient put

1157
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,800
putting the ruler on the hill what is

1158
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,240
the angle of the ruler if you're on the

1159
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,480
top of the hill it's flat if you're on

1160
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,720
the hill it's going to be at an angle so

1161
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,599
separating that ruler on the hill

1162
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,520
um to

1163
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
the

1164
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,680
hiking map the iso contour so let's make

1165
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
the ruler flat

1166
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,599
wherever it is whatever the slope is and

1167
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,680
then let's just take that ruler and kind

1168
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,160
of move it side to side as we go around

1169
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,200
this hill

1170
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
now if you're on the very top of the

1171
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,839
hill

1172
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,240
then the ruler is flat and there's no

1173
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,760
iso contour

1174
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,599
but if you're anywhere else on that

1175
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,359
whole landscape other than a local

1176
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,480
maxima

1177
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
there's going to be some angle

1178
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,119
to the ruler and some way to get around

1179
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,000
the hilt

1180
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,839
so that's the helmholtz decomposition so

1181
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,319
that's one piece that we get to bring to

1182
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,240
the puzzle and then

1183
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,640
one piece that um would be interesting

1184
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,040
to ask authors or someone with more

1185
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
technical experience is

1186
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,800
we've seen the helmholtz decomposition

1187
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,560
before into the solenoidal and the

1188
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
gradient components but then there's

1189
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,400
this housekeeping term

1190
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,880
um you know capital lambda

1191
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,680
and that's described in an appendix and

1192
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,200
it gets quite technical but it has to do

1193
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,160
with

1194
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,359
the

1195
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,480
density landscape changing

1196
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
as a function of flow

1197
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,720
so it's not just like we're gonna have

1198
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,760
one

1199
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,000
mountain topography

1200
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,680
and then we're gonna have rain falling

1201
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,440
on that one mountain

1202
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,400
there's gonna be some changes

1203
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,160
as we flow around

1204
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
so that it's more like you know you have

1205
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,400
a jet of hot water into a cold water

1206
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,560
you can't just take the

1207
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,000
the mountain

1208
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,280
of temperature

1209
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,720
and then just ask what happens if we

1210
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,960
pour hot water on top of that mountain

1211
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,119
because the mountain is actually

1212
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
changing the landscape is changing as a

1213
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,040
function of the flow and some of that

1214
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
gets incorporated into this housekeeping

1215
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,839
term so one tool that we have is from

1216
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,119
the flow toolkit is the helmholtz

1217
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
decomposition

1218
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,319
into

1219
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,880
these different components that help us

1220
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
reconstruct

1221
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,319
a flow

1222
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,520
that is a much better approximation

1223
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,440
stephen

1224
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,119
now you mentioned there that we've seen

1225
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,280
solenoidal and gradient before with

1226
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,000
helmholtz decomposition

1227
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,280
when you say we've seen it before we

1228
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,720
were saying we've seen it more recently

1229
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,760
with the

1230
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,680
solenoidal work

1231
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,839
um or is the solenoid all been in there

1232
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,839
with long

1233
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,359
like this was drawn actually

1234
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,760
oh yeah like we've discussed it in paper

1235
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
number 26 and other papers like th this

1236
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,839
is not a novel partitioning by the

1237
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,040
authors

1238
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
and it's very linked to other

1239
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
discussions that we've had about

1240
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,880
helmholtz decomposition in the context

1241
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,000
of

1242
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,880
distributional approximation

1243
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,240
but previously was there it was more of

1244
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,560
a focus on gradient descent

1245
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,160
the focus was in your regime of

1246
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,000
attention potentially

1247
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
right it was

1248
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,160
okay right going way back to early days

1249
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,440
okay

1250
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,160
okay so so in just without but in one in

1251
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,880
the in that paper that was um

1252
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,119
looking at solenoidal flow

1253
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,720
it was it was

1254
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
it was giving more weight to that wasn't

1255
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,000
it would you say it was given more

1256
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,520
weight was it using that in a different

1257
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,960
explanatory way because there has been

1258
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,560
this shift

1259
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
around solenoidal flow

1260
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,880
to give another way

1261
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,680
beyond organicity to

1262
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,440
explain how these dynamics can work

1263
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,839
they're kind of co-instantiated because

1264
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,839
they're partitionings from each other of

1265
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,480
the same underlying model so which one

1266
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,440
is emphasized more is totally a question

1267
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,079
of situation and flourish

1268
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,960
but

1269
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,599
it also may be the case that

1270
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
over the previous three years

1271
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,800
there's more of an emphasis on

1272
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,680
the importance of the iso contours in

1273
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,240
complex problem solving as opposed to

1274
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,440
just run and gun gradient descent

1275
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,240
so

1276
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
i agree with that so that's one tool we

1277
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,400
have okay so we do the helmholtz

1278
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,880
decomposition because again we're making

1279
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,960
this deep equivalence between dynamical

1280
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,599
systems and flow systems

1281
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
so one tool we have from the flow world

1282
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,079
is the helmholtz decomposition for

1283
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,839
vector fields

1284
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,078
now

1285
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,359
they write

1286
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,680
in section three one our objective is to

1287
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,480
identify the functional form

1288
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,200
so

1289
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
could be used in the sense like what

1290
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
function does it play or a functional is

1291
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,359
like a function of a function

1292
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,359
a functional form of the self

1293
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,680
information or potential function that

1294
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,520
describes the non-equilibrium steady

1295
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,880
state density

1296
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,720
okay so we go back to

1297
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,920
in three

1298
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
the fancy i

1299
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,680
the fancy j

1300
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,960
they write

1301
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,720
the first dissipative part performs a

1302
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
romanian gradient descent

1303
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
on a manifold on the negative logarithm

1304
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
of the steady-state density which can be

1305
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,240
interpreted as the self-information

1306
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,640
of any given state or as some potential

1307
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,359
function so this is how surprise should

1308
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,520
i be to be in this state so now let's go

1309
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,040
back to our bowl

1310
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,960
you shouldn't be surprised if you're at

1311
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,079
the bottom

1312
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,000
you should be surprised if you're at the

1313
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,160
top there's high potential now if it

1314
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
were gravity that were pulling us down

1315
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,240
that would be potential energy

1316
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,280
gravitational potential energy you have

1317
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,599
higher gravitational potential energy

1318
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,920
that can get dissipated

1319
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,480
free energy can be dissipated

1320
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
if you have greater

1321
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,319
potential energy

1322
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,359
so we want something that is just like

1323
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,960
you could have the bowl

1324
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,040
and the ball and know where is the ball

1325
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
expected to be

1326
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480
and where is it going to roll down from

1327
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,319
where is there potential that's high and

1328
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,720
where is the potential low

1329
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,800
and then

1330
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,760
here in figure one they're going to plot

1331
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,359
self-information

1332
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,680
on the bottom left that's the y-axis

1333
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,200
self-information

1334
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,599
and then there's that is fluctuating

1335
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,960
through time

1336
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,800
as the system is cranked

1337
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,520
it's kind of like if the

1338
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,200
self-information we're staying we're

1339
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,280
staying at a constant value it'd be like

1340
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,040
if you're in that race car going around

1341
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,240
the track

1342
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,839
then you're always where you expect to

1343
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,440
be because again the bowl it's like a

1344
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,119
point attractor

1345
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,880
and then the lorenz approximation is

1346
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,160
going to be to

1347
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,319
a dynamical approximation

1348
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,800
so we want to find the function

1349
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,079
of the non-equilibrium steady state

1350
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,839
that's going to be describing how

1351
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
surprised you should be

1352
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,079
the potential function

1353
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,880
for that system

1354
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,000
so these are big questions like

1355
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,920
how is the self information measured or

1356
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,359
calculated

1357
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,640
and then

1358
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,599
what does it mean for the

1359
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,720
self-information to be high or low

1360
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,119
and how does the self-information for

1361
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,640
different states that we might care

1362
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,599
about

1363
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
like homeostasis

1364
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,599
how does the self-information in those

1365
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,680
cases differ like is the

1366
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,280
self-information higher or lower when

1367
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,960
homeostatically you're in a good

1368
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,720
attractor so dean and then stephen

1369
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,040
so i don't know this but i would guess

1370
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,520
that on some basic level the measure is

1371
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
on its most absolute terms greater or

1372
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,839
less than

1373
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,680
to begin with

1374
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,000
because i think that that that relative

1375
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
difference

1376
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,680
is something that anybody doesn't even

1377
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,280
have to be aware of consciously

1378
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,160
calculating they can just

1379
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,240
you're kind of you can kind of tell

1380
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,400
but i'm not really sure but i would

1381
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,000
think

1382
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,599
that as as we

1383
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,839
as we go up in terms of the the

1384
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,760
determination and the accuracy of the

1385
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,160
measure we'll we would we could find

1386
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,680
ourselves

1387
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
getting more precise but on its most

1388
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,839
basic level i would think it would from

1389
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,760
a functional standpoint

1390
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,839
that's where we would have to begin

1391
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
yes and having um

1392
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,359
being less surprised

1393
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,319
about the state that one is in

1394
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,119
entails having a richer and a more

1395
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,240
accurate generative self model

1396
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,079
so if you have a model that just totally

1397
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,599
off base you're going to be recurrently

1398
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,880
surprised

1399
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,440
if you have a very nuanced

1400
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
self model

1401
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,240
your location and your circadian rhythm

1402
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,520
then

1403
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
different observations

1404
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,319
will be less surprising

1405
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,920
yeah i was just feeding back what you

1406
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,040
were saying because you did a really

1407
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,640
good explanation

1408
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,920
but the in in your explanation that the

1409
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,559
the key thing was i should be more

1410
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,319
surprised or i should be less surprised

1411
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,319
like you you yourself in doing the

1412
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,119
explanation come back to that basic

1413
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,480
difference

1414
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,119
and so again as we get more precise i

1415
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,960
think we can we can have more

1416
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,680
sophisticated ways of being able to show

1417
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,280
how we arrived there but at the

1418
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,760
beginning even a two-year-old

1419
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,319
can can somehow tell the difference

1420
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,480
between more and less that's why they

1421
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
dig in their heels right

1422
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,280
so

1423
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,720
it seems like on that basic level

1424
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,480
before we get into some of the more

1425
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
sophisticated stuff

1426
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,880
we all can it where it says addresses

1427
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,359
these questions for one simple case i

1428
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,760
think on its simplest terms that's where

1429
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,040
we can probably start

1430
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,280
we can look there first if that's not

1431
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
available i don't know that the other

1432
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,400
math

1433
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,359
matters i know it does but to the person

1434
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,839
who can't see that first i'm not sure

1435
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,000
where they go

1436
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,079
this past weekend we were hanging out

1437
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,240
with some larva with some children and

1438
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,040
we were really struck by how there would

1439
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,760
be some times where it seemed like you

1440
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,040
just would tell them something totally

1441
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,319
different like switch topic in the

1442
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,839
middle of a sentence and they just went

1443
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,040
along with it

1444
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,800
and then other times where they needed

1445
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,559
something really specific like they

1446
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,160
wanted that piece of food and they want

1447
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,440
it in this part of the plate and they

1448
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,599
want to touch it this way and so it's

1449
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,240
like they have a generative model

1450
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,640
and there's certain parts

1451
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,960
that they're surprised by or not and so

1452
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,319
we're just like we want that piece of

1453
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,000
food and i'm not too surprised at the

1454
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,319
route it takes to my plate but if their

1455
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,400
generative model entails a specific way

1456
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,079
that that is going to get to their plate

1457
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,520
they're going to be surprised by

1458
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,880
anything other than that and if they

1459
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,599
don't have a generative model of

1460
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,359
topics in the world

1461
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,680
then switching topics and talking about

1462
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,280
this event and then that event it's just

1463
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,400
like it's as if any other set of topics

1464
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,559
were addressed so

1465
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,880
great point about our intuitive

1466
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,520
connection to surprising information how

1467
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,960
that's related to our generative

1468
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,400
modeling so blue and then stephen

1469
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,160
so just um to go to your uh child model

1470
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,480
like having you know had lots of kids

1471
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,280
around for a lot of time

1472
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
you know food is something particularly

1473
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,920
that they like fixate on right

1474
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,400
i mean i uh my younger stepdaughter is

1475
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,880
like one of the easiest kids ever like

1476
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,119
she's so chill and so laid back but like

1477
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,720
i remember when she was about two years

1478
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,079
old she would like freak out like one

1479
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,640
time i cut i cut an apple for her like

1480
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,319
sliced it up you know just to make it

1481
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,119
like easy to eat and she like got so mad

1482
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,640
because she wanted the whole apple the

1483
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,720
whole thing um and she thought i was

1484
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,319
only gonna giving her a part of it but i

1485
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,480
think maybe food is i mean my point is

1486
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,079
i'm rambling about the story but maybe

1487
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,359
food is

1488
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,160
one of these things that that is like so

1489
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,559
baked in to our generative model because

1490
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,240
otherwise the children have an attention

1491
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,400
span of a gnat like you know you're in

1492
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,079
the car and they start to argue and you

1493
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,520
just say oh look at that pretty yellow

1494
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,200
car right there and then they're done

1495
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,520
they're over it like so so generally

1496
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,760
like the you can surprise a child and

1497
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,920
completely shift them but when it comes

1498
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,319
to food it's like this weird and many

1499
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,319
kids like not just you know aspen with

1500
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,839
the apple but then there's also like

1501
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,640
this food can't touch that food and like

1502
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,160
they have a bigger piece of cake than me

1503
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,240
and all this stuff so so it's food like

1504
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,319
this fundamental like

1505
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,720
baked in thing that that's like central

1506
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,720
to survival and therefore it's like very

1507
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,200
deeply ingrained in our generative model

1508
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,559
maybe

1509
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,920
nice agree stephen

1510
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,599
yeah so the idea of children i'll keep

1511
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,799
that analogy in there

1512
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,599
if so we've got this these flows

1513
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,079
happening and we we have

1514
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:56,960
um

1515
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,520
state spaces that get readings off so

1516
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,319
the very first state space region i mean

1517
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,640
unless you've got a prior somehow to go

1518
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,319
on you don't really know what that means

1519
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,520
and you get another one and another one

1520
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,400
and so you get a series of state space

1521
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,240
insights so to speak and then you'll

1522
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,599
start to get a sense of whether

1523
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,480
something's more or less than

1524
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,240
i mean in the simplest term the average

1525
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,400
right but you know we can then use

1526
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,559
gradient descent and that to sort of

1527
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,160
get get an understanding of that and

1528
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,440
that with children that can be

1529
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,880
interesting is

1530
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,480
so yeah sometimes i just want to go with

1531
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,240
everything and then and i notice also

1532
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,480
like i get that with um my daughter

1533
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,040
layla sometimes it's like you know

1534
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,920
um

1535
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
she'll she'll say like

1536
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
i want something very specific or that

1537
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,599
school there so and so went to that

1538
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,160
school like now she knows that well i

1539
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,680
know because that's what happened when i

1540
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,599
was little meaning when she was a small

1541
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,880
baby or

1542
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,640
and it's all kind of made up

1543
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,880
stories in some extent but it's kind of

1544
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
like she's converging on she's got

1545
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,760
enough state space information to say

1546
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,720
okay

1547
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,079
and and probably you've got that with

1548
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,680
food right it's like there's there's

1549
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,240
enough state space information to say

1550
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
this and they can be prouders and i know

1551
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,680
that and you didn't know that she said

1552
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,359
to me you know i knew that you didn't

1553
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,440
know that i knew that

1554
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,760
this is quite cute but you've got that

1555
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,680
okay so she's got enough

1556
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,240
state space awareness

1557
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,599
that's they're gonna converge down and

1558
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,200
then there's other times like when you

1559
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,480
want them to just

1560
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,000
stay on the football pitch and not run

1561
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,119
off to the swings uh they just go crazy

1562
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:27,839
so

1563
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,440
there's something about

1564
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,000
you know sampling the space and saying

1565
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,640
you've got enough information

1566
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,000
and synchronization onto joint action

1567
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,280
manifolds

1568
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,359
is going to be one of the

1569
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,599
prices of the paper

1570
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,920
so blue as a response and then dean

1571
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,599
so

1572
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,760
you know super interesting about like

1573
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,680
asking your daughter steven like you

1574
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,599
know or the things she says that she

1575
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,200
remembers from when she was a baby

1576
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,960
something that's really fun to do with

1577
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
kids and this also leads to like the

1578
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,960
synchronization uh where i feel like

1579
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,520
maybe where we're going but um

1580
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,760
ask a kid when they can first talk like

1581
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,920
when they can barely talk maybe like you

1582
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,839
know two years old

1583
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,839
um ask a kid where they were before they

1584
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,480
were born um the answers are awesome or

1585
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,680
like do you remember being in your

1586
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,079
mommy's tummy like and like you know

1587
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,799
i've heard ranges and ranges of answers

1588
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,960
for from kids and it's really super

1589
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,119
interesting so where is this like is it

1590
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,200
some inherited prior is this like past

1591
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
life regression or is it just like

1592
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,799
they're falling into synchronization

1593
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,160
they're making something up because

1594
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,280
children have these like great

1595
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,000
imaginations at that age but but where

1596
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,559
does this come from like are they just

1597
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,400
responding back to what they think you

1598
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,079
want to hear this is like an absurd

1599
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,160
question to ask a kid right like i mean

1600
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
you can't really expect a reasonable

1601
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
answer but ask because it's fun to find

1602
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,079
out what what they think that they were

1603
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,160
doing before they got here it's fun and

1604
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:56,960
dean

1605
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,400
first

1606
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
yeah i i think it's interesting because

1607
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,680
if you're going to go back to that

1608
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,960
geometry

1609
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,960
aspect of you know

1610
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,359
can can two-year-olds think in the

1611
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,680
abstract state yes they can

1612
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,960
number one

1613
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,599
and the other part i think i think where

1614
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,359
we're sort of

1615
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,960
we're all sort of synchronizing around

1616
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,440
is that if it's less or more that can be

1617
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,160
represented by the x and the y on a

1618
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,359
graph

1619
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,599
we've already shown that but if you want

1620
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,920
to think whether it's in or out

1621
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,760
you have to add that z

1622
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,799
vector and that is the part that most

1623
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,640
learning

1624
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,000
doesn't necessarily explicate it's there

1625
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
two-year-olds do it they know whether

1626
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,760
they're in or out they know whether

1627
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,599
they're getting the whole apple or a

1628
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,040
slice

1629
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,040
so

1630
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,720
again i ask

1631
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,520
are we are we attempting as people who

1632
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,599
are trying to help the two-year-old

1633
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,079
to build a bridge from point a to point

1634
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:56,960
b

1635
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
or should we be actually understanding

1636
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,880
this as

1637
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,040
building something that is a product

1638
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,400
that is material

1639
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,839
to something that is possible that's

1640
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,880
what the stochastic field is until we

1641
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,599
collapse it to that point b

1642
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,040
right

1643
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,280
and and the only way that that happens

1644
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,599
is if we include in and out if we

1645
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,839
include the zed

1646
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,079
dimension to this so

1647
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:22,960
again

1648
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,920
if we

1649
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,480
if we can't get in our own minds if we

1650
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,559
can't get that correct

1651
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,480
then we're actually going to get in the

1652
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,000
way of developing pedagogy

1653
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,920
it's i'm sorry to say that but it's

1654
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,040
actually true so we we can think of

1655
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,200
these little people as these wonderful

1656
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,079
little right right brain the right brain

1657
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,720
hasn't been brought down to

1658
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,799
these these these equations at the

1659
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,720
bottom of this page and yet they're

1660
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,400
still able to function

1661
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,440
their functional form is

1662
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,839
self-information based on product to

1663
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,839
process to be determined

1664
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,640
okay so again i'm not saying this

1665
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,559
because i've got it all picked up but

1666
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,240
because i don't want

1667
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,319
to have this active inference tool which

1668
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,000
is a fantastic potential potentiator to

1669
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,720
be collapsed to now

1670
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,799
here's the here's the potential outcomes

1671
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,839
that we can engineer a through zed

1672
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,480
that that doesn't allow for a hudson

1673
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,839
yards and yet there's a hudson yards so

1674
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,920
if we're going to help people

1675
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,240
let's not as you say daniel let's not

1676
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,040
over reduce prematurely here in the

1677
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,839
hopes of actually helping people when in

1678
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,720
fact what that does is it says

1679
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,599
as you fall out of the sky raindrop

1680
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,839
you you shall depart this

1681
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,119
this flow

1682
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,520
uh in surrey british columbia or the

1683
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,240
gulf of california or

1684
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,240
at the at the mouth of the st lawrence

1685
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,760
river we can't do that or we shouldn't

1686
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,040
but we do and i can't understand why

1687
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,520
the greatest thinkers do that well i can

1688
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,680
because we like to talk

1689
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,079
but but bottom line is we've got to

1690
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,400
think rethink this that's what active

1691
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,280
inference supports

1692
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,440
totally

1693
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,960
agreed and we can engineer the landscape

1694
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,520
of flow you can add a dam so that the

1695
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,599
water droplets do go one place or

1696
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,680
another but

1697
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,680
very interesting metaphor so stephen on

1698
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,359
this and then we're gonna go to the next

1699
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,720
tool that gets introduced

1700
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,319
yeah i think

1701
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,400
well i think i feel i know so there's a

1702
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,240
question of it's an interesting question

1703
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,119
as well when you say you've got a

1704
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,280
two-year-old um

1705
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,880
is where do they

1706
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,440
get their knowing from so we have

1707
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,280
abstraction in terms of thinking

1708
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,119
abstraction

1709
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,680
so we have well and and the sort of

1710
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
ontological abstractions that we can

1711
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,400
create around our knowledge structures

1712
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,359
but you know they have access to two

1713
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,440
years of state space

1714
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,480
experiential sensations of which they

1715
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,839
can then

1716
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,079
make a story from

1717
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,640
whichever way they so please as they can

1718
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,359
so there's an interesting question um

1719
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,760
that that what it means to know that's

1720
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,200
abstract i.e or what's outside of

1721
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,160
the sort of lived experience level and

1722
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,079
it's sort of and there's that that other

1723
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,280
way and

1724
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,440
when when one thing i always find

1725
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,680
interesting is i see a child is around

1726
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,440
the age of two three

1727
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,880
you see you really see a change in the

1728
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,799
fingers that the whole morphology of the

1729
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,240
body shifts

1730
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,520
and i think one of the reasons that

1731
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,680
maybe that memories aren't accessible

1732
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,599
from before the age of three is

1733
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,119
literally they were encoded in a

1734
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,520
different body that's too too far

1735
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,799
removed

1736
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,119
to revisit the

1737
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,039
the priors or the likelihoods from the

1738
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,000
state spaces that have been laid down

1739
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,240
um so it may be partly

1740
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,599
a natural way that we sort of forget

1741
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,599
but we don't necessarily forget thoughts

1742
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,200
that we had cognitively we just forget

1743
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,440
the um the embodied stuff because we're

1744
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,880
gonna we're gonna lay down some new

1745
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,119
stuff unless you have a trauma in which

1746
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,760
case that can lock in certain states

1747
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,880
blue any comments on that

1748
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,520
of course so you know

1749
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,119
it's interesting um

1750
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,799
the the

1751
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,799
encoding in a different body i mean

1752
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,039
we're doing that every seven years right

1753
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,280
um like we've full cell turnover but you

1754
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,799
know there's there's this process of

1755
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,960
synaptic pruning that happens

1756
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,280
um so as like we're babies you know we

1757
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,359
grow bazillions of neurons and then

1758
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,280
synaptic pruning happens like around the

1759
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,280
age of two or three where a lot of those

1760
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,280
neurons die back and then the ones that

1761
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,559
stay uh exist and continue to to build

1762
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,039
stronger and build better but everyone

1763
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,680
is so completely different in terms of

1764
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,359
like their ability to remember things

1765
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,039
from when they were baby and not always

1766
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,960
related to trauma like i have no

1767
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,359
conscious memory stream until like i was

1768
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,520
10 which is super late and like there's

1769
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,280
no i mean maybe i might do some like

1770
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,359
hypnosis and reveal some kind of trauma

1771
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,280
like at some point in my life but

1772
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,520
i mean for me to not have any like i

1773
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,039
remember like some flashes of some stuff

1774
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,319
i remember the photograph he showed me

1775
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,160
the picture oh yeah i remember that do i

1776
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,599
remember it no i probably remember the

1777
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,520
picture of it right like so there's this

1778
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,839
whole other level of thing but the idea

1779
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,160
of being encoded in a different body

1780
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,920
is super interesting because of course

1781
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,079
my body's different now also but from

1782
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,200
when i was 10. right but i mean also

1783
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,720
like you know when you're 90 your body's

1784
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,720
different from when you're 50. so what

1785
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,400
stays what goes

1786
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,039
how is it chosen is it this embodied

1787
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,440
aspect of it or is it just like you know

1788
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,440
we lock into the things that we think

1789
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,839
are important for our model and if it

1790
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,440
doesn't if it's not relevant for our

1791
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,480
model maybe we just let it go

1792
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,119
dean

1793
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,240
i just want to say this real quick

1794
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,000
because i know you want to move move

1795
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,240
forward daniel but everything that we

1796
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,799
describe here in order to get to a

1797
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,960
concept of between

1798
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,599
whether it's between

1799
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,520
us today and us

1800
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,240
seven years plus a day before that

1801
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,799
between or any other between that we

1802
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,640
want to describe

1803
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,280
at some fundamental level we have to be

1804
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,039
able to discriminate between more and

1805
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,319
less

1806
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,760
and what's in

1807
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,520
and what's out

1808
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,160
if we can do those things

1809
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,000
we in any situation can describe between

1810
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,799
now

1811
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,280
once we can describe between we can see

1812
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,480
a difference between what a product is

1813
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,839
the bottom of this slide and a process

1814
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,079
something that that equation

1815
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,000
can do

1816
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,960
if we can get if we can get that clear

1817
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,799
then stochastic

1818
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,319
chaos

1819
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,400
is a between thing

1820
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,599
that we can then manipulate to a certain

1821
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,319
outcome or we can leave open

1822
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,520
to possibility if we can get that

1823
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,119
just that

1824
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,079
we we will have conquered more than most

1825
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,480
people have conquered in their lifetime

1826
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,280
because

1827
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,760
they use the word between but i don't

1828
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,720
think they necessarily understand

1829
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,720
what makes that up

1830
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
and i think that's what we

1831
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,440
i that's what i would like to be able to

1832
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,760
share with others and co-learn

1833
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,039
with others as opposed to

1834
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,760
excuse me building another

1835
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,839
set of specific outcomes that we can

1836
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,319
measure and say this was you

1837
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,760
one month ago

1838
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,960
you a and this is you now seven years

1839
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,799
plus a day

1840
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,079
and now we're going to now we're going

1841
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,400
to decide whether or not you're closer

1842
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,720
to some thing that i've arbitrarily

1843
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,520
selected as the thing that makes you

1844
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,280
have learned something

1845
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,079
if we can get there could you imagine

1846
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,240
how amazing that would be that's just

1847
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,480
that one thing sorry i get really

1848
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,880
passionate about this but holy crap i'm

1849
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
actually talking to people who can

1850
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,280
actually hear that and go oh

1851
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,880
that's interesting instead of just

1852
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,720
dismissing it out of hand and going we

1853
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,559
don't need to learn that because we

1854
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,079
already know what between means

1855
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,760
between is geometric

1856
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,839
so for sure information geometry will

1857
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,079
come into play and then the idea of

1858
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,200
taking

1859
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,960
vast

1860
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,240
situations

1861
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,400
and through time with uncertainty and

1862
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,640
then calculating more or less

1863
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,520
kafka expected free energy

1864
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,440
that could be an extremely helpful

1865
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,599
approach so blew anything on this or

1866
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,799
we'll continue

1867
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,319
yeah so what's the next tool are we

1868
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,000
going right into the markup blanket

1869
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,240
because man when we talk about between

1870
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,839
oh yeah i just want to get to the markup

1871
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,680
like it um

1872
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,599
when we talk about between i think that

1873
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,520
having that idea of the markov blanket

1874
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,680
anyway i'll add it at that time so so go

1875
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,000
on carry on absolutely the markov

1876
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,280
blanket is um even understood by the

1877
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,680
non-technical as a betweenness

1878
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,079
but is it the betweenness that is your

1879
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,680
epithelium mechanically or what kind of

1880
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,200
betweenness are we actually talking

1881
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,479
about

1882
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,319
we need the tools

1883
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,158
let's go to the next tool

1884
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,318
so

1885
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,799
however this is the quote in general we

1886
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,719
cannot discount the correction term that

1887
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,640
arises when flow operators are a

1888
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,399
function of states

1889
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,279
so if it were just mount everest we

1890
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,799
could just do the solenoid and the

1891
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,120
gradient decomposition and then figure

1892
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,759
out how to combine iso contours with

1893
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,520
gradient climbing and we would get to

1894
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,080
the top however

1895
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
swept under the rug by the housekeeping

1896
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:46,960
term

1897
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,399
is this

1898
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,759
change in the underlying

1899
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,080
mountain landscape

1900
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,158
indeed it is this state dependency that

1901
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,479
underwrites stochastic chaos so a way to

1902
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,679
think about that as like the double

1903
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:00,960
pendulum

1904
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,920
the chaoticness of that system arises

1905
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,479
from the exact angle that the double

1906
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,479
pendulums are in you can't just say

1907
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,920
there's a mount everest and it's the

1908
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,719
bottom it's like okay not very helpful

1909
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,880
for me predicting these wacky waving

1910
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,319
shapes it's doing

1911
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,000
this presents us with a more difficult

1912
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,120
problem

1913
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,198
the problem can be finessed

1914
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,839
by using polynomial expansions

1915
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,479
of the flow operator and the potential

1916
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,679
as follows for n states so it could be 1

1917
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,439
2 3 4 n dimensions

1918
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:36,319
up to polynomial order m

1919
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,479
so a linear approximation has a

1920
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,359
polynomial order of one a quadratic

1921
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,679
approximation has a it has a polynomial

1922
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,000
order of two and so on so it's like

1923
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,960
fitting higher and higher order terms so

1924
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,359
the big idea is that we're going to use

1925
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,359
polynomial expansions

1926
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,719
to approximate complex underlying flow

1927
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,560
functionals

1928
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,560
polynomial expansions do

1929
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,440
many things but most importantly they

1930
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,000
restrict or scaffold our model selection

1931
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,199
approach to a very specific form

1932
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,360
and function and size and tractable

1933
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,199
computation so

1934
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:14,800
individuals might be familiar with a

1935
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,199
taylor series which is where you take a

1936
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,120
given point and you say well what is

1937
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,960
this function at that point like the

1938
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,199
sine of zero is zero and then you say

1939
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,040
what's the first derivative that's this

1940
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,120
red line and then you say what's the

1941
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,880
second derivative okay it's starting to

1942
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,560
curve a little down okay what's the

1943
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,040
third derivative and so on and you can

1944
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,880
use the taylor series to approximate

1945
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,480
that function

1946
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,080
further and further out from your

1947
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,159
entry point that you're calculating the

1948
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:43,520
first second third fourth fifth

1949
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,679
derivative on etc

1950
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,280
and then

1951
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,960
this is a static

1952
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,199
approximation so this is something that

1953
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,440
might be learned in high school or

1954
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,920
college level maths

1955
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,760
a topic that's very related but not

1956
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,159
always discussed is the volterra series

1957
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,120
and so

1958
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,719
the volterra series is a model for

1959
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,400
non-linear behavior similar to the

1960
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,719
taylor series it differs from the taylor

1961
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,800
series in its ability to capture memory

1962
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,800
effects the taylor series can be used um

1963
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,159
for approximating the response of a

1964
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,560
nonlinear system to a given input if the

1965
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,239
output of the system strictly depends on

1966
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,560
the input at the given time

1967
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,760
and this

1968
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,520
is developed quite extensively the

1969
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,199
volterra in

1970
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:29,280
spm textbook by fristen at all so again

1971
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,760
many of the seeds and roots of what

1972
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
we're talking about today

1973
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,440
check the spm

1974
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,679
textbook and documentation

1975
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,600
because that's where a huge amount of

1976
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,960
this

1977
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,320
competency in these authors arose from

1978
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,400
and how they represented it almost 15

1979
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,920
years ago

1980
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,679
so

1981
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,159
what happens when we do this polynomial

1982
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,360
expansion of the functional fort well

1983
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,520
first off we moved the problem that we

1984
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,040
were solving from static mountains only

1985
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,000
to

1986
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,080
trampolines that are moving as we're

1987
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,199
walking

1988
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,960
that's what brings

1989
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,600
state-dependent changes into the mix and

1990
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,280
action as well

1991
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,080
and it moves us from again a static

1992
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,080
landscape that we can just calculate

1993
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,000
where the rulers are flat on

1994
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,080
and then just figure out the best way to

1995
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,480
get there well you can't just lay a flat

1996
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,360
ruler if they're state dependent changes

1997
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,320
because where the ruler's flat at t zero

1998
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,320
is not where the ruler is flat literally

1999
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,640
the next moment dean

2000
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,239
yeah i think this is excellent daniel

2001
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,719
because what this now says is

2002
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,640
now we can explain why there are

2003
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,000
impressions

2004
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,159
why there's some residue left over why

2005
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,880
the in and out aspect of this not just

2006
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,159
the bump

2007
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,000
but the in and out going through that

2008
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,440
bump

2009
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,960
also has to be

2010
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,960
accommodated or export at least

2011
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,280
acknowledged as part of everything that

2012
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,679
we're looking at here the whole thing

2013
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,120
so yes

2014
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,520
that's a great explanation thank you

2015
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,000
and the learning landscape isn't just

2016
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,719
the mountains the interaction landscape

2017
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,480
is more like it's like the coupled

2018
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,560
systems we'll get to soon but it's even

2019
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,719
one person learning landscape

2020
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:13,840
is like

2021
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,080
being in trampoline world sometimes

2022
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,360
so

2023
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,840
that brings us into this

2024
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,679
space with many important topics that

2025
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,040
are discussed

2026
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,320
in an earlier

2027
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,920
and different way by the spm textbook

2028
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,280
now how good

2029
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,320
is or could be this polynomial expansion

2030
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,000
they write inspection of the lorenz

2031
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,400
system suggests that a second order

2032
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,560
polynomial approximation is sufficient

2033
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,400
given the flow is second order in the

2034
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,280
states

2035
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,080
so

2036
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,360
we're fitting an approximation that has

2037
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,120
two terms so it's like a quadratic

2038
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,640
so that's why we talked so much about

2039
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,760
the bowl

2040
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,679
because the approximation that we're

2041
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:56,800
fitting

2042
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,960
is bowl-like

2043
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,159
which allows optimization techniques

2044
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,440
that are simple like convex optimization

2045
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,120
those are easy roll the ball to the

2046
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
bottom of the hill by minimizing the

2047
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,560
potential function

2048
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,800
which potential function the free energy

2049
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,640
potential function the free energy

2050
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,600
functional

2051
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,600
whereas if it was a rugged optimization

2052
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,960
landscape

2053
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,199
you get the whole headache of how do you

2054
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,640
know when to stop and what if there's

2055
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,159
just a whole neighborhood you didn't

2056
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,320
even go to so

2057
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,600
it seems like

2058
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,159
potentially a second order approximation

2059
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,159
is sufficient

2060
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,280
then they use this word onsots which is

2061
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,199
nice it's an assumption about the form

2062
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,800
of an unknown function

2063
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,040
made in order to facilitate solution of

2064
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,640
an equation or other problem

2065
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,880
so now we're going to go with this idea

2066
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,239
that if we can

2067
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,080
have a second order approximation to the

2068
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,440
lorenz we're going to be doing good

2069
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,280
enough let's work with that and see if

2070
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,199
that turns out to be the case

2071
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,719
so it turns out

2072
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,800
if this thing that's so hard to model

2073
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,199
the self-information the surprise

2074
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,600
the potential function is modeled by a

2075
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,679
second order polynomial

2076
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,560
then the non-equilibrium steady state is

2077
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,199
approximately gaussian

2078
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,199
this is known as the laplace

2079
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,040
approximation in statistics which is

2080
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,080
also in spm very helpfully

2081
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,080
here we generalize the notion of laplace

2082
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,679
approximation to cover not just the

2083
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,000
quadratic form of the log density but

2084
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,360
also the solenoidal flow that

2085
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,840
underwrites non-equilibrium dynamics

2086
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,880
so the laplace approximation in

2087
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,640
classical statistics

2088
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,880
is like we're going to take the density

2089
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,360
distribution of

2090
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,199
what we're trying to estimate

2091
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,239
and we're going to find the peak

2092
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,000
the maximum point and then we're going

2093
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,719
to fit a gaussian over that peak

2094
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,480
and so if there's like a big shoulder

2095
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,560
and then a tiny shoulder you're just not

2096
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,239
going to get that tiny shoulder right

2097
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,159
but that's a very rich distribution if

2098
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,760
it really has that structure in the real

2099
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,719
world

2100
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,679
what you're going to get for that

2101
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,280
distribution is

2102
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,719
a gaussian centered around the big peak

2103
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,719
so for some distributions you're going

2104
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,520
to be way off there are things

2105
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,360
that are hard to estimate

2106
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,960
and there's things that don't work well

2107
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,280
with the laplace approximation it's not

2108
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,159
a solution it's an approximation however

2109
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,320
if we're interested in the mean and the

2110
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,360
variance around potentially the bulk of

2111
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,800
a distribution

2112
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,920
then

2113
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,520
solving the

2114
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,159
parameters for the laplace approximation

2115
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,040
is as easy as fitting a quadratic

2116
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,480
which is to say

2117
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,400
the ball sliding to the bottom of the

2118
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,800
bowl and once you go beyond second order

2119
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,320
approximation

2120
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,040
you have a third order quadratic

2121
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,239
there's a whole

2122
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,480
another world because then the ball

2123
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,239
could get caught in that first little

2124
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,560
elbow or it could fall off the other

2125
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,520
side

2126
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,560
so higher order approximations

2127
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,600
they take more computational resources

2128
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,360
and while they might have increased

2129
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,560
accuracy

2130
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,560
they can often be less tractable to

2131
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,520
actually solve so this is

2132
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,199
at least

2133
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,360
in my reading a pretty fundamental

2134
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,880
contribution to

2135
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,800
the statistics of complex systems

2136
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,640
because they've taken the notion of

2137
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,400
laplace approximation

2138
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,640
not just towards estimating the mean and

2139
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,960
the variance of some distribution out

2140
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,840
there

2141
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,880
but

2142
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,840
to

2143
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,000
the solenoidal component of flow post

2144
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,719
helmholtz decomposition related to

2145
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,320
non-equilibrium dynamics

2146
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,800
stephen so

2147
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,560
like at up to this point we actually

2148
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,120
don't need markov blankets yet it's

2149
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,880
giving this we haven't used the word so

2150
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,400
how's not going to play has not come to

2151
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,679
play yet at all

2152
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,600
exactly exactly

2153
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,640
so

2154
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,280
it's telling so you've told the story

2155
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,640
of what needs to be in place for

2156
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,400
there to be the the kind of

2157
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,080
state spaces

2158
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,440
and then the nature of these state

2159
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,640
spaces being so changeable

2160
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,640
and non-linear

2161
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,000
and then

2162
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,159
there's this on top of that then there's

2163
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,840
a way to

2164
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,480
attractively work within that which is

2165
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,199
the la pass approximation in statistics

2166
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,960
which gives you

2167
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,600
does it always give one gay gaussian on

2168
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,920
any landscape or is there multiple or is

2169
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,560
it just one per landscape is that yes

2170
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,440
per

2171
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,400
dimension per state the laplace returns

2172
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,280
one and only one mean and variance

2173
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,719
it's like fitting a gaussian

2174
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,600
distribution to the log density

2175
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,280
so it does only give one which is why i

2176
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,600
gave the example of the two hump it's

2177
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,440
going to pick one

2178
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,480
and go there and all right so yeah let's

2179
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,480
look at figure two and so

2180
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,560
how interesting though that

2181
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,239
the papers mark off blankets and still

2182
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:47,840
cast the chaos

2183
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,920
but we're not even at the marco blanket

2184
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,840
but the way that it gets led into

2185
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,040
is very

2186
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,239
um

2187
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,480
improved and different than what we've

2188
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,840
seen before

2189
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,480
instead of assume a partition

2190
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,159
dot dot dot dot

2191
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:07,440
we're starting way back so now

2192
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,600
here on the left

2193
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,400
is the flow of the lorenz system

2194
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,480
using the helmholtz decomposition

2195
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,199
so here are the three components of the

2196
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,960
flow as they've described it the blue is

2197
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,239
the gradient

2198
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,800
the orange is the solenoidal flow and

2199
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,440
then the gold is the correction

2200
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,400
housekeeping term

2201
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,360
right

2202
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,199
this uses the same format but for a

2203
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,440
laplacian system based upon the lorenz

2204
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,120
in the upper panel

2205
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,320
so we're going to be fitting

2206
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,520
a laplace like approximation to

2207
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,840
each of the states

2208
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,760
each of the dimensions of this lorenz

2209
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,480
strange attractor

2210
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,000
the key difference is that the

2211
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
dissipative part of the flow operator

2212
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,960
and the hessian are positive definite so

2213
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,000
just really quick matrix vocabulary the

2214
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,920
jacobian matrix

2215
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,880
is the matrix of the first partial

2216
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,920
derivatives so in the x y and z

2217
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,679
dimensions or however many there are

2218
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,679
what is the angle of the ruler that's

2219
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,760
the first partial derivative

2220
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,960
the hessian

2221
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,360
is the second order partial derivatives

2222
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,760
so it's describing the local curvature

2223
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,159
so if someone said my ruler's flat and

2224
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,159
it's curving down you're on the top of a

2225
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,239
hill if your ruler's flat and it's

2226
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,920
curving up you're at the bottom of a

2227
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,800
hill

2228
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,760
and so on so that's how the zeroth the

2229
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,320
value of the function the first

2230
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,199
derivative and the second curvature are

2231
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,480
used like

2232
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,480
in calculus

2233
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,560
so

2234
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,239
the hessian is positive definite which

2235
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,400
means the gradient flows converge to the

2236
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,159
maximum of the non-equilibrium

2237
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,480
steady-state density this is reflected

2238
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,159
by the blue arrows that point to the

2239
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,920
center of the state space

2240
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,159
so in the lorenz world

2241
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,360
you're getting race card around the flow

2242
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,199
is taking you all over the place yet

2243
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,080
by making the laplacian approximation

2244
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,560
all of a sudden the flow

2245
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,120
the attractive part that's dominating

2246
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,679
the movement within that space it's

2247
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,520
actually convergent

2248
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,840
so that's not to say the lorenz system

2249
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,239
converges to a stable point

2250
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,360
it's to say our approximation parameters

2251
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,679
converge towards potentially a more

2252
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,880
tractable and simple attractor

2253
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,560
in the abstract approximation space

2254
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,239
and we'll see how well of an

2255
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,639
approximation that indeed is but that's

2256
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,000
the key difference is here the blue

2257
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,560
arrows are taking you on a wild ride

2258
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,239
as the gradient takes you around the

2259
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,280
lorenz flow here we're doing a flow

2260
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,159
composition on our approximation which

2261
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,560
we constructed to be of a certain type

2262
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,280
and it turns out to have properties

2263
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,679
in its attractor that are very different

2264
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,199
than the loretz

2265
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,239
dean and then stephen

2266
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,080
uh unmute dean and then yes

2267
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,920
here's a question for everybody here if

2268
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,920
if we're talking about

2269
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,840
a

2270
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,840
process could we be looking at those

2271
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,080
over time seeing those arrows in both

2272
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,239
the lorenz and the

2273
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,000
place decomposition

2274
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,120
thickening or expanding or

2275
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,800
like having water added to them is has

2276
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,760
anybody contemplated whether in fact

2277
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,120
that is what is happening over time

2278
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,760
so the fit is actually from a within

2279
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,080
that the space is getting filled up by

2280
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,960
these arrows growing

2281
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,040
in terms of their circumference

2282
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,600
very interesting question

2283
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,760
the length of the arrow usually

2284
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,840
describes the amplitude like the speed

2285
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,920
of the flow in that moment i do not know

2286
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,080
if i've seen a visualization where the

2287
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,120
tree rings the arrows represent thicker

2288
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,159
or thinner vectors but great question

2289
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,840
and if anybody with more experience in

2290
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,199
vector math

2291
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:04,880
has a thought that could be very

2292
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,360
interesting to know okay

2293
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,320
stephen and then blue

2294
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,639
and just to clarify that i've got this

2295
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,159
right but in each of those um

2296
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,920
points where you've got the blue arrow

2297
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,280
and the solenoidal flows so each one

2298
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,320
would be

2299
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,280
solved so to speak for that point as a

2300
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,840
as a um

2301
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,159
you know a gaussian

2302
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,199
approximation and then by this is like

2303
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:36,639
an assemblage of multiple

2304
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,600
results of a gaussian approximation and

2305
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,960
it's sort of mapping them out so to

2306
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,159
speak and so you know this this idea of

2307
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,320
multiple

2308
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,400
pieces of information and nestedness is

2309
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,560
it sort of comes into play with this

2310
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,639
yeah there's some landscape

2311
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,800
and we go out there with our ruler our

2312
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,120
jacobian and our curvature ruler our

2313
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,639
hessian and then we're going to make

2314
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,400
just transects on the hill and we're

2315
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,159
going to just sample a bunch of points

2316
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,760
and add a bunch of points you know one

2317
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,320
comma one one comma two

2318
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,840
we're going to use the ruler and the

2319
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,120
curvature

2320
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,719
and we're going to look at at that point

2321
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,560
where the field is

2322
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,679
pointing

2323
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:16,639
and then

2324
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,120
if you've sampled at um in inadequate

2325
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,040
resolution you're not going to see your

2326
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,080
coherent

2327
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,600
vector field

2328
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,880
so you need to sample at a resolution

2329
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,040
that allows the vector field to be kind

2330
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,760
of obvious

2331
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,159
so blue

2332
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,920
so i just want to point out for people

2333
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,800
who might not know that

2334
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,520
you need to have a positive definite

2335
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,040
hessian

2336
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,480
to calculate a covariance matrix like in

2337
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,400
statistical analyses that i've done this

2338
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,000
is like one critical

2339
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
point and if you don't have an

2340
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,480
invertible hessian then you have to

2341
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,880
recalculate your model because

2342
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,280
all of your factors are too entangled to

2343
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,600
find out how they are covaried together

2344
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,280
or separately so i just wanted to for

2345
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,040
anybody who doesn't have the background

2346
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,280
in in matrix math um

2347
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,719
point that out

2348
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,199
yes thanks dean

2349
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:14,639
so blue help me does that mean literally

2350
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,440
that you can't thin

2351
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,760
one of those

2352
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,239
arrows

2353
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,719
you can't you can't let certain things

2354
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,920
be purged from your state space

2355
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,159
because that's like i really don't know

2356
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,239
i'm not questioning i'm asking a

2357
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,960
question from a statistical standpoint

2358
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,639
and then being able to translate that to

2359
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,719
the physical

2360
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,920
reality

2361
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,480
so i don't translate to physical reality

2362
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,239
well my brain just like doesn't work

2363
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:47,199
that way

2364
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,920
but but what has to happen is what that

2365
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,960
really means is you can't establish

2366
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,520
conditional independence

2367
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,760
without having some idea of the

2368
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,600
covariance and so if you can't calculate

2369
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,080
the covariance you can't discover this

2370
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,159
conditional independence which is where

2371
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,760
we're building up to

2372
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,639
in

2373
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,639
in specifying the markov blanket so i

2374
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,159
just want that's that's why i wanted to

2375
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,360
just point that out because you have to

2376
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,320
have that

2377
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,040
ability to find that that covariance

2378
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,360
okay let's go to where the covariance

2379
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,000
comes into play and then stephen so

2380
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,600
we're gonna address

2381
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,000
how well does this approximation work

2382
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,360
because i mean we're fitting a few

2383
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,719
quadratics

2384
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,679
to like the og complex system is that

2385
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,560
really going to work

2386
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,400
what's being shown in figure three

2387
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,199
is

2388
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,159
um on the very top so this is the left

2389
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,560
one is second versus third first versus

2390
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,800
third and first versus second so these

2391
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,679
are like three projections on a cube so

2392
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,400
we're looking on a flat screen or piece

2393
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,679
of paper about a three-dimensional

2394
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,280
state space

2395
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,320
and the red dots are the sampled

2396
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
trajectory

2397
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,639
in that cube so it's like there's a

2398
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,080
firefly moving around in the cube and

2399
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,280
we're looking at it this way and so

2400
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,600
we're projecting it onto that

2401
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,800
screen

2402
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,280
and then in the background

2403
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,520
we see this very nice

2404
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,960
unimodal

2405
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,080
gaussian

2406
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,600
attractor

2407
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,199
so the lighter part is like the

2408
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,000
attractor part and then the darker part

2409
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,960
is

2410
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,800
higher potential function

2411
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,600
more surprising less likely

2412
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,360
so that is the lorenz trajectory

2413
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,960
being played out

2414
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,120
in our

2415
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,600
laplace-like approximation cube

2416
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,800
and so it can be shown that the flow of

2417
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,679
the laplace approximation

2418
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:46,320
it it has some of that kind of butterfly

2419
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,639
race car dynamics

2420
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,960
it's probably doing a lot better than

2421
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,560
just sticking a linear equation through

2422
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,440
it but it's not perfectly recapitulating

2423
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,920
the underlying lorenz system so how good

2424
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,679
is the approximation

2425
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:00,960
well

2426
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,840
one thing that this approximation is

2427
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,520
going to live or die by is whether it

2428
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,120
can characterize

2429
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,679
the lorenz system as chaotic or not

2430
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,960
because if it turns out that the way

2431
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,639
we're going to deal with chaos systems

2432
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,719
with a positively open of exponent is

2433
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,360
fit a non-chaotic model oh i made an

2434
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,600
oscillator pendulum to describe

2435
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,360
homeostasis

2436
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,960
okay so you made a simple model great

2437
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,120
but what's really interesting is if our

2438
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,560
approximation

2439
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,840
could also reflect chaos yet handle it

2440
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,639
tractably so what they do in formalism

2441
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:35,679
12

2442
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,120
is they show that the estimated lyopniv

2443
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,639
dimension

2444
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,120
for the approximation

2445
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,920
is

2446
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,280
2.48 and they use some um numerical

2447
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,199
approximation techniques here like by

2448
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,679
sampling a grid

2449
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,920
kind of that transect sampling idea but

2450
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,520
for the leopardive exponent at those

2451
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,320
points rather than say just the gradient

2452
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,239
and that favors

2453
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,040
um or that um compares very favorably

2454
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,199
2.48 2.43

2455
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,639
importantly they're both like similar

2456
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,159
and way over one

2457
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,880
with the actual analytical

2458
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,719
leopardive dimension

2459
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:13,679
so

2460
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,880
the approximation is actually

2461
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,520
highlighting the chaotic nature and

2462
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,080
almost quantitatively the extent of the

2463
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,840
chaos because there's more and less

2464
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,440
chaotic systems

2465
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,719
and so

2466
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,239
for our purposes the laplace

2467
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,080
approximation is easier to handle than

2468
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,000
the lorenz system because the functional

2469
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,520
forms of the flow and potential are

2470
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,199
immediately at hand

2471
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,040
that's the whole point we used an

2472
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,679
approximation family of equations that's

2473
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,320
going to be like having a ball rolling

2474
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,719
down to the bottom of a bowl rather than

2475
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,400
being swept up in turbulent flow

2476
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,320
figure four is where we get to the

2477
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,120
covariance that blue mentioned

2478
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,199
okay so we're going to have

2479
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,280
three states those are the x y and z

2480
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,040
states or dimensions of the lorenz

2481
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,159
system

2482
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,760
and now

2483
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,040
um we can look at the log of so the log

2484
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,040
is just sort of a

2485
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,800
transformation to help highlight some of

2486
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,560
the differences between zero and one

2487
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,320
especially

2488
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,199
we can see the log of the jacobian which

2489
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,000
is that first partial derivative the log

2490
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,760
of the hessian which is the second

2491
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,480
partial derivative and then the log of

2492
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,159
the covariance

2493
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:25,840
in the middle which is like what blue

2494
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
was referencing so here

2495
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,880
the first and the second

2496
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,639
states dimensions

2497
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,920
have very high correlations

2498
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,600
neither of them are correlated with the

2499
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,600
third so the on diagonals are states

2500
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,600
being correlated with themself the first

2501
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,880
and the second dimensions have high

2502
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,440
correlation well what does that look

2503
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,400
like when we use that cube shining light

2504
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,400
so on the bottom left here

2505
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,639
we can see like the first and the second

2506
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,840
have a like an oblong relationship

2507
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,320
that scatter plot has

2508
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,239
a significant regression through it

2509
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,600
there's a correlation coefficient

2510
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,920
there's mutual information there

2511
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,760
there's non-sphericity

2512
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,520
whereas the other ones that are

2513
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,000
uncorrelated relationships have what

2514
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,280
looks to be more of a spherical

2515
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,600
correlation like if you sample variable

2516
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,239
a and b and it's just a circle

2517
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,480
there's no mutual information

2518
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
and so interestingly

2519
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,560
the covariance

2520
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,679
matrix

2521
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,760
looks a lot like the hessian matrix

2522
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,480
so

2523
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,199
that is providing evidence

2524
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,960
that if what we care about is the

2525
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,679
covariance amongst the states

2526
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:41,360
we're getting a very similar structure

2527
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,040
when we use

2528
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,880
the second order polynomial

2529
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,560
approximation

2530
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,480
to those states

2531
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,040
and it turns out that it does

2532
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,480
pretty well

2533
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,600
if you want to for example estimate

2534
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,719
the first state given the second so

2535
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,159
what if we could only measure two

2536
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,000
dimensions well we wouldn't want to pick

2537
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,600
one and two because they're basically

2538
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,520
correlated in their measurements

2539
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,679
we would want to pick two and three and

2540
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,000
then do a really good job at predicting

2541
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,480
one given two

2542
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,880
which is to say that the informational

2543
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,360
dimension of this system is

2544
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,960
between two and three

2545
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,600
it's two and a half basically

2546
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,159
so those are some of the connections

2547
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,480
between covariance amongst different

2548
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,760
dimensions

2549
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,960
and

2550
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,960
polynomial expansions

2551
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,040
to

2552
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,000
dynamical systems based upon flow

2553
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
approximation

2554
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,600
and then just to summarize here then we

2555
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,040
can have any questions and then in the

2556
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,199
last 20 minutes we'll look towards the

2557
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,920
markov blanket we still haven't even

2558
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,320
gotten to the markov blanket yet

2559
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,239
so just this is the um the foothills of

2560
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,920
mount markov

2561
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,840
and

2562
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,000
they write it's important not to compl

2563
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,120
conflate

2564
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,400
it's important not to conflate the

2565
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,400
simplicity of a non-equilibrium steady

2566
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,480
state density

2567
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,440
that's this one

2568
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,280
with the complexity of the underlying

2569
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,880
density dynamics

2570
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,360
the map is not the territory you just

2571
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,520
cannot say it enough simple

2572
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,440
approximations are not claims about

2573
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,040
system simplicity

2574
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,199
in other words when prepared or observed

2575
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,199
in initial estate the probability

2576
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,040
density can evolve in a complex and

2577
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,120
itinerant fashion on various sub

2578
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,080
manifolds of the pullback tractor and

2579
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,600
they're going to use information length

2580
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,520
to talk about that but the important

2581
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,280
thing to know is just that our

2582
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,880
approximation has attributes that

2583
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,880
resonate with the original underlying

2584
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,199
systems dynamics as well as attributes

2585
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,600
that we specifically know are different

2586
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,239
or they might be different or not but no

2587
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,760
matter what they're not claims about the

2588
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,520
underlying system so that's not a pipe

2589
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,920
stephen

2590
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,280
yeah i think this also speaks to

2591
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,280
this idea of triangulation or multi

2592
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,040
modality

2593
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,360
is like say this this isn't directly

2594
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,360
speaking to what's out there or what the

2595
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,800
system or

2596
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,120
or what you could say what whatever the

2597
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,600
things are that have been

2598
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,840
inferred

2599
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,320
so there needs to be or that the more

2600
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,800
approximations that can be triangulated

2601
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,560
as i say which is kind of what happens

2602
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,400
in qualitative research qualitative

2603
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,080
research is all about the triangulation

2604
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,199
of research not about the exact measures

2605
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,600
and accuracy within research

2606
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,080
then you can

2607
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,360
get a better

2608
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,560
grip

2609
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,719
potentially on what might be out there

2610
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,880
if that makes sense so like you say with

2611
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,560
that pipe you kind of

2612
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,920
you know if i could if i could go in and

2613
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,960
you know i've only got i've only got one

2614
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,440
aspect of that reality so i can only

2615
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,400
resolve it to a certain degree um and it

2616
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,480
is what it is and then i i'd have to see

2617
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,239
i i don't know how big that is as a

2618
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,320
painting how you know until i see it in

2619
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,520
a gallery etc etc right so

2620
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,480
um

2621
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,440
yeah i think that that this this

2622
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,239
um

2623
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,480
the need to find the way to get an

2624
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,480
approximate weigh-in

2625
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,920
means that you need to have many

2626
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,560
approximate ways in to

2627
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,239
start to make

2628
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,560
a higher level confidence in what you're

2629
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,159
thinking

2630
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,400
thanks stephen dean

2631
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,239
yeah daddy can you go back slide 48 for

2632
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,119
a second yes

2633
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,080
so this is the fascinating thing about

2634
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,400
contrast and proportion

2635
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,400
because you've got nine

2636
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,000
squares up in the upper right there with

2637
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,719
the jacobian and the

2638
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,800
and the covariance and the hessian

2639
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
trying to translate that and that then i

2640
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,719
understand this is this is the big uh

2641
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:55,280
this is the sort of the the

2642
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,159
grail of translation to translate that

2643
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:58,960
and the

2644
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,639
contrast and the proportion that you see

2645
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,719
there to fresh eyes to new eyes they

2646
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,639
might look at that middle one

2647
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,159
with it with a completely different

2648
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,320
sense of what that pattern is describing

2649
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,800
for us than the than the two outside

2650
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,320
slices of bread

2651
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,840
to us because we're a little bit more

2652
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,159
familiar with it the contrast in the

2653
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,239
proportion you can actually see where

2654
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,560
they has cn matters from a statistical

2655
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,199
standpoint but drop that into a context

2656
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,199
now where you've got mountains and

2657
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:30,080
rivers and lakes and forests and streams

2658
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,400
and how do we take that information

2659
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,480
there which is which is really quite

2660
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,320
clear to people who are familiar with it

2661
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,639
and translate it to the context the

2662
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,960
situation in which we find ourselves and

2663
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,719
are now trying trying processing to a

2664
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,600
converged sense of context what does

2665
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,800
this

2666
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,119
what does this envelope tell us right

2667
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,920
we're inside of this cube now how do we

2668
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,119
get outside of it use this tool

2669
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:59,679
to so we to re-enter

2670
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:03,760
the context and have a a

2671
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,840
an upon sense of what covariation

2672
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,040
means

2673
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,320
this is this is the grail if we can set

2674
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,440
up our learning experience

2675
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,920
as a situated one where we take this

2676
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,520
tool in

2677
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,400
but don't confuse the tool as you say

2678
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,320
don't confuse the math

2679
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,639
with with the field

2680
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,360
that's that's again

2681
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,360
it's it's fantastic if you can get a

2682
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,520
whole bunch of people seeing

2683
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,000
what what's the big picture here what's

2684
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,119
the tool

2685
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,360
what's the contrast in proportion with a

2686
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,480
tool

2687
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,600
and then what is the context what's all

2688
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,239
of this fractalized stuff out there in

2689
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:47,520
different colors

2690
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,760
and different shapes and different sizes

2691
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,520
how do those how do we put those two

2692
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,280
things together into some sort of

2693
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,360
coherent narrative

2694
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,360
great point

2695
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,119
so in the last

2696
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,119
10 to 13 minutes

2697
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:04,400
we're going to finally converge to

2698
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,760
the m word

2699
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,600
markov blanket

2700
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,400
um and then next week it would be

2701
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,960
awesome to speak with any of the authors

2702
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,239
or anyone else who would like to share

2703
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,600
their perspective

2704
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,400
or

2705
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,800
we'll continue because like

2706
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,040
we're basically halfway through and we

2707
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,119
haven't gotten to the core piece of the

2708
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,760
markov blanket so we're gonna just look

2709
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,960
where we're going

2710
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,840
in the last little bit of dot one and

2711
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,600
then in dot two we're gonna like you

2712
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,760
know land on that markov trampoline and

2713
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,520
then see where we go

2714
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,880
okay

2715
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,040
in section four

2716
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,800
they're going to repeat the analyses of

2717
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,639
the previous section

2718
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,280
approximating two lorenz systems coupled

2719
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,199
to each other through their respective

2720
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,880
first states

2721
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,480
this induces a richer conditional

2722
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,800
independent structure from which one can

2723
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,880
identify internal and external states

2724
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,480
that are independent when conditioned

2725
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,800
upon blanket states so

2726
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,480
this is

2727
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,600
the more classical markov blanket

2728
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,560
definition which is blanket states are

2729
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,520
those

2730
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,400
that conditioned upon them make internal

2731
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,000
and external states conditionally

2732
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
independent so that's a definition that

2733
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,080
we've seen before and the internal

2734
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,400
external and blanket states they all are

2735
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,480
co-instantiated it doesn't make sense to

2736
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,880
talk about one without the other

2737
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,239
and

2738
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,600
we've mentioned that before so in

2739
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,960
um

2740
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,880
figure seven it's a lot like figure

2741
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,080
three

2742
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,760
where we were looking at those three

2743
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,080
projections of the cube of one lorenz

2744
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,840
system well now we're looking at two and

2745
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,440
it's pretty clear from looking at their

2746
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,880
trajectories

2747
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,480
as well as just from their movement in

2748
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,880
the state space like these are pretty

2749
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,800
synchronized so

2750
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,679
some

2751
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,400
coupling has been instantiated

2752
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,159
no different than if you had like two

2753
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,920
engines and then you connect them with a

2754
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,840
heat transfer device they're gonna have

2755
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,080
coupled temperature fluctuations except

2756
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,639
now it's like more statistical

2757
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,920
figure eight

2758
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,840
is a lot like figure four so in figure

2759
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,560
four we had this three by three

2760
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,520
matrix describing the first partial

2761
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,600
derivatives second partial derivatives

2762
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,119
or the covariances

2763
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,520
of states one two and three and the on

2764
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,960
diagonals were staged with themselves

2765
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,400
and the off diagonals were states with

2766
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,520
other states

2767
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,719
now

2768
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,400
we're going to have

2769
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,639
three plus three states

2770
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,600
two sets of three two coupled lorett's

2771
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,000
one two and three is the first lorenz

2772
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,840
and then four five six are the three

2773
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,600
states of the second lorenz

2774
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,840
you see that in the jacobian there's

2775
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,520
high correlation

2776
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,560
within

2777
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,520
each lorenz system and then there's that

2778
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,960
one and four

2779
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,440
where there's a strong value that's the

2780
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,400
coupling like that is the cell that

2781
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,560
represents the coupling between the

2782
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,800
first upper quadrant and then the lower

2783
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,960
right quadrant

2784
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,199
and that induces some extremely

2785
01:40:57,199 --> 01:41:01,280
interesting covariance structures

2786
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,679
that is what we want to investigate it

2787
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,920
turns out that by looking at the hessian

2788
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,880
of this system

2789
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,840
some partitions fall out

2790
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,960
those partitions

2791
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,719
can be numerically

2792
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,280
analyzed to show that

2793
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,040
[Music]

2794
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,639
basically there's

2795
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,480
partial correlations

2796
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,400
that approximate the hessian of the

2797
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,000
lorenz systems that are coupled

2798
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,040
so

2799
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,480
we can use

2800
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,719
the hessian which we already established

2801
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,480
the second order polynomial expansion is

2802
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,080
like basically adequate

2803
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,320
we can use the hessian of our

2804
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,719
approximation not of the system not the

2805
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,000
system has a hessian our model of the

2806
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,040
hessian

2807
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,760
approximation

2808
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,040
very well

2809
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,760
aligns with the partial correlation

2810
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,600
and so that's demonstrated

2811
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,600
by showing that two states that

2812
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,440
shouldn't have correlation third and

2813
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,080
sixth and fourth and fifth so like here

2814
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,520
three and six are not correlated

2815
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,520
we can show that even if they start very

2816
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,960
correlated like they just happen to

2817
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,600
start at a similar value

2818
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,520
the dynamics of the system actually move

2819
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,840
them towards having a zero or even a

2820
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,800
slightly negative partial correlation so

2821
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,679
our

2822
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,679
hessian approximation

2823
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,159
is giving us deep insight into the

2824
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,840
partial correlations

2825
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,840
and then i

2826
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,860
think a great place to sort of um

2827
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,760
[Music]

2828
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,880
posit

2829
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,840
is with this connection of the graphical

2830
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,360
bayesian network that we've looked at

2831
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,560
before

2832
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,719
with that same partitioning into four

2833
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:43,119
states internal external and blanket

2834
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:45,600
states now fristen and others

2835
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,480
then partitioned the markov slash pearl

2836
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,000
blanket states

2837
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,560
which are of one kind

2838
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,600
into these two kinds of blanket states

2839
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,800
incoming sensory states and outgoing

2840
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,360
action states that's what links us with

2841
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,760
perception cognition action and control

2842
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,520
theory and

2843
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,760
planning as inference so this is an

2844
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,280
image we've seen before

2845
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,679
and here are those six states

2846
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,280
so one two and three that's lorenz

2847
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,960
system one one then four five six is

2848
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,880
lorenz system two

2849
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,520
and one and four is the only cross

2850
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,199
coupling that we're putting into the

2851
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:23,679
model that's this cell right here so

2852
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,520
we're cross coupling one and four you

2853
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,080
know you have two neurons

2854
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,080
they have two neurons and then there's a

2855
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,560
little tin can between the two of you

2856
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,040
and that's inducing

2857
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:38,800
a global structure to all six nodes so

2858
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,320
you don't need to have every neuron

2859
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,159
wired to every neuron

2860
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,800
there's sparsity in this connection

2861
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,480
structure

2862
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,639
and

2863
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,280
technical details aside

2864
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,000
that is going to relate to the

2865
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,480
partitioning which we're going to be

2866
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,760
deriving

2867
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,199
a partitioning

2868
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,719
on the hessian

2869
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,639
which is a second order polynomial

2870
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:03,840
expansion

2871
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,119
of our

2872
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:06,400
model

2873
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,520
so

2874
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,320
i think um

2875
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,840
that is um a great place to

2876
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,320
go for today

2877
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,639
and uh just then just to close and we

2878
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,000
can have last thoughts or what we want

2879
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,600
to talk about next week just to

2880
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,159
reiterate there's no claim either the

2881
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,320
original lorenz system or

2882
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,800
coupled lorenz system possesses a markov

2883
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,520
blanket so the territory doesn't have a

2884
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,400
markov blanket our coupling doesn't even

2885
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,639
have a markov blanket

2886
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,480
the claim here is that there exists a

2887
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,800
laplace approximation to these kinds of

2888
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:41,840
systems

2889
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,920
that in a virtue of the zero elements of

2890
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,199
the hessian feature markov blankets

2891
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,920
so not has a markup like it is wants to

2892
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,440
be did have

2893
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,719
those are

2894
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,520
speculative interpretations that maybe

2895
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,000
future larva will discover to be the

2896
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,199
case or not

2897
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,679
but what this paper actually claims is

2898
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,000
very far from that

2899
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,280
blue and then stephen

2900
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,760
okay so here we're going to stop just

2901
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,520
since we're getting good just as it's

2902
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,920
getting really good okay um it's the

2903
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,480
cliffhanger for next week i just wanted

2904
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,679
to leave off with where this figure is

2905
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,000
in the paper like right under that

2906
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,159
figure it says the names active and

2907
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,560
sensory or blanket states inherit from

2908
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,320
the literature where these states are

2909
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,480
often associated with biotic systems

2910
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,119
that act on and sense their external

2911
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,320
mulu

2912
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,520
so

2913
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,400
i'm like why are they imputing sensory

2914
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,719
states onto particles like this is where

2915
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,960
the great leap in the paper kind of

2916
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,520
happens for me and i'm like okay now my

2917
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,639
particle

2918
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,480
is sensing

2919
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,320
which is like to me okay like i'm

2920
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,679
actually okay with that like you guys

2921
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,360
know you've seen me like

2922
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,800
i'm pretty good with pan psychism at all

2923
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,159
at overall and um it doesn't really make

2924
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:01,280
a big deal

2925
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,280
big difference for me um i'm still very

2926
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,800
interested but

2927
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,639
it's something that a lot of people i

2928
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:08,719
think are going to get maybe uh tripped

2929
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,000
up by so i would like to hash that out

2930
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,719
and to say well there's absolutely no

2931
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,639
claim that real systems have a markov

2932
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:17,679
blanket

2933
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,440
you know like the skin

2934
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,560
it's like

2935
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,000
are we going to be talking about real

2936
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,159
systems and how it maps onto physical

2937
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,679
components of the real world and the

2938
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,480
mechanisms of sensory transduction

2939
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,080
or is this about the hessian

2940
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,679
approximation

2941
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,119
to the laplace

2942
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,239
so

2943
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,480
sometimes very close to each other in

2944
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,080
the text

2945
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,280
so that can make it a little bit

2946
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,480
ambiguous stephen

2947
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:43,840
yeah

2948
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,960
um very very cool yeah blue blue makes a

2949
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,320
good point

2950
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,360
i suppose what i'm sensing here here and

2951
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,880
correct me if i'm wrong is that this is

2952
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,239
showing a way to show that patterns can

2953
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,320
be existing

2954
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,320
within the covariance of um

2955
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,960
attractor states or attractors

2956
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,320
just in themselves it could just be a

2957
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,040
blob of stuff right in amongst blobs of

2958
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,800
things and stuff and particles and then

2959
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,719
it also shows that

2960
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,560
there can be

2961
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,800
the ability for

2962
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,920
those

2963
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,679
dynamics

2964
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,600
to partition out

2965
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,520
so it's

2966
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,480
kind of

2967
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,480
gives a bit of two ways it gives the

2968
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,239
partition outpieced

2969
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,639
and then it also gives

2970
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,320
a way to have a blob

2971
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,400
this is a very technical term a blob of

2972
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,199
very

2973
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,600
useful stochastic chaotic states which

2974
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,679
don't need to be themselves

2975
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:42,960
blanketed

2976
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,320
but could be what becomes just sort of

2977
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,400
sensory states for instance

2978
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,040
but could be a reservoir

2979
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,360
within a bigger reservoir and would that

2980
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,480
be

2981
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,760
a correct

2982
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,280
sort of assumption if we truly had no

2983
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,679
difference between our approximation

2984
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,239
and our incoming observations like we

2985
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,400
had a perfect model

2986
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,440
then

2987
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,679
maybe there'd be a valid claim that the

2988
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,600
map was the territory and for systems

2989
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,080
that we define in software it actually

2990
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,600
can be that way

2991
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,080
but for any real system this

2992
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,080
approximation there's always going to be

2993
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,000
a delta between the incoming

2994
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,840
observations and our approximation and

2995
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,480
so the claim here is that it's the

2996
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,639
hessian the second level polynomial

2997
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:34,400
expansion of our approximation that has

2998
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,520
some very nice mathematical properties

2999
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,920
not that the system has that or any

3000
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,080
specific properties

3001
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,760
dean

3002
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,440
yeah i would just

3003
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,679
speak to the idea that the skin is a is

3004
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,840
a great example because

3005
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,760
you can look at it only as a product as

3006
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,800
a limit

3007
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,800
or you can look at skin as a process i

3008
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,239
mean we know that

3009
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:59,360
all the processing that's going on there

3010
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,040
so

3011
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,000
again

3012
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,440
do we do we do we collapse it down to

3013
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,080
one type of function as a product as a

3014
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,440
limit

3015
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,760
or do we see it actually as a process as

3016
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,760
well as as a something that's dynamical

3017
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,239
something that's constantly changing and

3018
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,480
then that opens up the idea of what

3019
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,320
between means now i don't know if it

3020
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,560
takes it down to the particle level

3021
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,320
seems like it does at those at those

3022
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,119
blank scales but i'm not really worried

3023
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,599
about that so much as i'm i'm

3024
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,360
interested in the idea

3025
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,400
of what

3026
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,960
betweenness is

3027
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,880
because i don't know that skin

3028
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,560
automatically

3029
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,119
is a partition sometimes it's a process

3030
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,280
as well so if we keep that open that'd

3031
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,440
be something interesting to take up next

3032
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,678
week

3033
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,679
great yeah i think if anyone else has

3034
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:52,800
any

3035
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,520
comments like what a fun

3036
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,960
paper and dot one we

3037
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,280
hit a lot of the warm-up

3038
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,719
stretching and preliminary topics

3039
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:06,560
and contextualization that brought us

3040
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,199
like right to the vista

3041
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,480
of mount markov with further clouds

3042
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,159
behind even that

3043
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:17,679
but we're where we know that we can step

3044
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,840
into the dot 2

3045
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,560
with a backpack that's prepared and then

3046
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,679
these are really interesting and clearly

3047
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,880
either unresolved and or uncommunicated

3048
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,760
and or unapplied questions in

3049
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,080
literature in the state of the art which

3050
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,719
is what is the relationship between

3051
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,440
these formalisms and specific

3052
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,599
nouns and verbs

3053
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,599
in the world the kinds of things that

3054
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,679
we're semantically engaging with and if

3055
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,040
it turns out that the semantics of a

3056
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,280
markov blanket are not like the

3057
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,280
semantics

3058
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,760
of any other thing

3059
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,360
or they're importantly different from

3060
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,040
the semantics of

3061
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,360
what we currently feel familiar with

3062
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,480
great

3063
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:03,199
or it would be interesting if they do

3064
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:06,000
map or overlap or encompass or nest

3065
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,719
within some other semantics that already

3066
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,520
exist but that's the question

3067
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,159
so um

3068
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,719
we can just look at our final

3069
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,480
closing questions and if anyone has a

3070
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,760
thought otherwise 32.2

3071
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,199
next week on november 16th

3072
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:26,560
and

3073
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,440
we hope to hear from you if you would

3074
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,480
like to

3075
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,719
join the discussion live just get in

3076
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,040
touch with us or contact us at

3078
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,679
or just show up and

3079
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,520
ask questions or make comments in the

3080
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,000
live chat

3081
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,520
but

3082
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,520
interesting stuff

3083
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,760
we were

3084
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,800
a little trepidatious with such a

3085
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,639
complex paper

3086
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:55,440
but

3087
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,080
i think bringing simplicity

3088
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,000
and simple rules underlying complex

3089
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,920
behavior and how can our approximations

3090
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,920
be tractable even when the world is just

3091
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,599
infinitely surprising

3092
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:06,719
those are some of the fundamental

3093
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,040
questions that this paper and active

3094
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,440
inference address so blue steven and

3095
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,280
dean

3096
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,320
great work

3097
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,400
and we will see everybody

3098
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,719
next week

3099
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:21,719
bye
