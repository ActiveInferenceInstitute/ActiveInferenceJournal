[Music]

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,880
hello and welcome everyone to actin flap

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
livestream number 32.3

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
it's december 16th 2021 and we are

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,840
really excited to be here with connor

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
one of the

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,920
authors today we'll just jump right into

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,719
it

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,280
our goal is to be

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
learning and discussing this awesome

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
paper stochastic chaos and markov

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
blankets from 2021 with carl firsten

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,760
connor heinz kyle ulzhoffer lancelot

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
acosta and thomas parr

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
and we had a

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
0.1.2

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
on this paper and today we're just

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,960
excited to have a.3 so we'll have a

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,159
presentation by conor when we'll all be

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
providing our regime of attention and

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
writing down any questions and comments

23
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,520
we have and writing any questions in the

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
live chat if we would like and then we

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,640
will have a discussion to kind of

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
follow up on the presentation so connor

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,600
thank you for joining and please take it

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
away

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
great thanks daniel thanks for having me

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
i'm really happy to be back this is my

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,479
second time

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,920
on the stream so it's nice to be here

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,079
um okay i'm gonna share my whole screen

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,559
and now

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
here's the presentation

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,240
looks good thank you looks good okay

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
cool so yeah could you maybe right where

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,479
it says hide meet jitsi is sharing your

39
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,360
screen

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
yep and then

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
hit hide yep

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
the whole thing disappeared but then

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
yeah okay perfect we're back right yep

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
thank you

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
um yeah so as daniel said i'll be

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
presenting on um this paper

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
that was published um this fall in

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
entropy called stochastic chaos and

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,800
markup blankets

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,760
and

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
it's really great that you guys have

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
already gone through the paper in detail

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
from what i remember from watching some

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,720
of the past streams so we don't have to

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
go through every single

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
equation in every figure

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
because you guys have already kind of

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
covered it very thoroughly but we can

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,560
dive in

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
with as much technical detail as anyone

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
wants to so i'm kind of going to give

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
broad strokes of the paper and also

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
frame it in the context of other

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
literature that's come out on similar

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
topics in the past few months like oh

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
yes

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
a bunch of literature has been published

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
on the same sort of themes

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
um so that'll kind of help contextualize

70
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,480
what i consider to be the main

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
contributions of the paper

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,599
and

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
there's both methodological and

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
theoretical ones so there's a lot to

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
talk about here and

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
as daniel said i guess afterwards we'll

77
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,519
do this discussion but if um either of

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
you has question or anyone in in the

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
jitsi has questions during it like feel

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
free from my end i'm fine being

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,319
interrupted but whatever the format is

82
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,200
fine

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000
um

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
okay so without further ado i'll get

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,159
started so just a quick introduction to

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,280
me

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
so i'm one of the co-authors on the

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,920
paper and i'm a phd student based in

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
constance germany where i'm supervised

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
by ian cousin who is a kind of um

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
leading

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
scientist in the fields of complex

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
systems and collective animal behavior

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,519
so he's the head of the department of

95
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,040
collective behavior at the mox planck

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,840
institute for animal behavior

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
and um so yeah we

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
in constance we're basically building a

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
kind of hub for the study of complex

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
systems and collective behavior in

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
particular then i'm also co-advised by

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
the lead author on the paper who's carl

103
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
fristen who kind of came up with the

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
fundamental uh premise of a lot of the

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
concepts in the paper like the free

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
energy principle bayesian mechanics

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,639
markov blankets stuff like that

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
so the outline um first i'll talk about

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
the motivations for the paper some of

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
the contextual literature

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
and then i'll summarize what i consider

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
to be the main takeaways but there's a

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
lot of different perspectives on this

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,840
paper so we these aren't by any means

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
the only way to interpret the paper

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,919
and then all

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
in the interest of just kind of getting

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
us all in the same conceptual footing

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,320
i'll review stochastic processes and in

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
particular a special interpretation of

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
stochastic processes called the

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
helmholtz decomposition which is

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
something that you guys have already

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
talked about in the past streams

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
here quite a bit

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
and then i will step through the primary

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,199
moves of the paper in my mind and i'll

128
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,560
leave out i'm not going to go through

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
every single figure like i said but i'll

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
just step through what i consider to be

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
the primary moves

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
so in this past year a bunch of work has

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,039
come out on the general theme of

134
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
bayesian mechanics

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,680
um so

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,039
if you want to kind of look at this

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
paper in the context of other work i

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,039
would say that the major works are

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
things like the bayesian mechanics for

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
stationary processes which just

141
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
last week was finally published in

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
proceedings a of the royal society so

143
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,039
we're very happy about that and that

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
kind of established the fundamental

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
mathematical formalism for bayesian

146
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
mechanics and the conditions under which

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
you can

148
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
apply a bayesian mechanical lens to

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
dynamical systems random dynamical

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
systems so this is something that's been

151
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,560
covered in previous live streams that

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,440
and a few of which lance and i were were

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
attendants at

154
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
there's another great paper that's a

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
pre-print right now by miguel aguilera

156
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
and some of his colleagues

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
that studies very similar grounds that's

158
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,680
covered in this first paper basically

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
studying the the necessary conditions

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
for bayesian mechanics and

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
in particular

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
uncovering what's known as the

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
synchronization manifold um and studying

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
that in the context of simple linear

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
gaussian systems

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
and then finally there's this paper also

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
produced also in the same special issue

168
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
of entropy

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
as the present paper called memory and

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
markov blankets and that's again

171
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,639
studying how markup blankets actually

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
evolved through time

173
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,000
i mentioned these three papers because

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
they all study bayesian mechanics and in

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,479
particular they're all focused primarily

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
on linear systems so systems

177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
that are often in the stochastic

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
literature called uh linear diffusion

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
processes or ornstein ulenbek processes

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
um so that's a really deep common thread

181
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
to all of them is they leverage the

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
mathematical tractability of these

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
simple linear systems to get really nice

184
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
analytic proofs about when bayesian

185
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
mechanics exists and when it doesn't

186
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
i i say the primary focus on linear

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
systems because in for instance basic

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
mechanics for stationary processes the

189
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
mathematical derivations actually apply

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
to any processes that have a gaussian

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
steady state not only linear ones but

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
the primary examples used in that paper

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
were all linear systems i mean there are

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
a few non-linear ones but the focus and

195
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
the the tight derivations focused on

196
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,919
linear systems

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,720
um so given that kind of contextual

198
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
background now we can talk about the

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
main takeaways of this paper stochastic

200
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
chaos and markup blankets

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
so the the first main thing is basically

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
taking a random dynamical system in this

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,360
case we're taking a stochastic version

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
of the lorenz attractor and we're trying

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
to basically apply the lens of bayesian

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
mechanics to it so the same thing that

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
these previous papers have done to look

208
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
at the paper from the perspective or

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,160
look at the system from the perspective

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
of how is the system look as if it's

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,199
forming beliefs about other subsets of

212
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
variables in its environment so that's

213
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
what something we also call the physics

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
of sentience how can physical systems

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
not necessarily things we typically

216
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
think of as sentient actually exhibit

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
the hallmarks of something like

218
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
biological

219
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
computation or representation

220
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
the second main takeaway is

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
finding that you can fit the helmholtz

222
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,479
decomposition which is this

223
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,919
special

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,400
interpretation of stochastic processes

225
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
that we'll cover in the next few slides

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
how can you kind of learn that

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
decomposition automatically from data or

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
not from data but from stochastic

229
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,679
dynamical systems where the usual

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
tractability doesn't exist so that's a

231
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
big methodological contribution it

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
actually lays out a kind of the steps or

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
an algorithm for doing this

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
automatically for systems that lack the

235
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,560
usual analytic tractability like you get

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,959
with linear systems

237
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
and finally

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
i think another kind of big contribution

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,560
here that was kind of tucked into one of

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
the later sections of the papers was

241
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
pretty interesting

242
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
is a new result on the relationship

243
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
between the markov blanket and causal

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
coupling between systems so we basically

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
show that a markup blanket does not

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
always imply

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
uh causal relationships and vice versa

248
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
so the markov method is fundamentally a

249
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
statistical relationship that doesn't

250
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
always go hand in hand with a causal

251
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,240
relationship

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
so those are the main three takeaways

253
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
that i'll discuss today but there's a

254
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
few others that we can also dive into

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
that may have been covered in other live

256
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
streams

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
so um

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
to to do the

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
first goal of like basically deriving a

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
physics of sentience

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
we need to actually start with bayesian

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
mechanics as our goal and then from

263
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,040
there we'll get to the study of

264
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
stochastic processes so i'm going to

265
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,360
quick

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
first give an overview of bayesian

267
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
mechanics

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
the general idea of babes and appearance

269
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,320
is very i would say it can be described

270
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
very non-mathematically which is

271
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
basically you just have a system

272
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
that's embedded in some kind of ambient

273
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
environment

274
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
and crucially that system has an

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,839
interface with the environment it can

276
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
only exchange information with the

277
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
environment through some kind of sensory

278
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
uh or active interface so in the context

279
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
of

280
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
the the most popular use case for

281
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,839
bayesian mechanics that would be

282
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
something like a brain a nervous system

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
that's insulated from the world via

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
things like

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,160
muscular organs effector organs and then

286
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
sensory modalities so the interface is

287
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
comprised of the way we can impact the

288
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
world around us as well as the way that

289
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,279
we kind of absorb or are impressed by

290
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
information from the world

291
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,839
and then you can zoom in right and say

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,920
that a single cell has the same kind of

293
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,279
relationship where

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,200
intracellular processes are like the

295
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
equivalent of the brain you know this is

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
um genetic things going on with dna or

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
just intracellular

298
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,720
metabolic

299
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
cascades and then the interface would be

300
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
something like the cell membrane which

301
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
kind of mediates information and energy

302
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
transfer between the cells intracellular

303
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,720
contents

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,600
and then some extracellular environment

305
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
and then for from my perspective what

306
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
i'm interested in studying personally is

307
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
kind of zooming out and saying how can

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
you look at an entire system let's say a

309
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
school of fish or a flock of birds as if

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
the whole thing is a kind of internal

311
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
system that's insulated from some kind

312
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,880
of social or physical environment where

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
the interface here might not be as

314
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,839
simple as

315
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,920
um your skin or

316
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,800
uh

317
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,680
a

318
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
cell membrane but something more

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,760
embodied by other individuals maybe the

320
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
sensory interface between a group and

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,160
its surrounding are sensory or active

322
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
individuals and that's you know this is

323
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
very catered to my own interests but as

324
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
you know there's tons of people are

325
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,839
trying to apply the same framework to

326
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,440
all kinds of systems even like

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
socio-technical systems and societies

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
and stuff so it's a very generic

329
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
framework

330
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
that's the fundamental kind of partition

331
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
of the world that we're interested in

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
with bayesian mechanics and what

333
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
bayesian mechanics is saying is that if

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,560
you take these three sets of states

335
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,680
which i've now termed mu internal

336
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
b blanket that's the interface states

337
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,079
and then edda which is the external

338
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
world if you take that fundamental

339
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,240
three-way partition of the world

340
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
bayesian mechanics is just saying that

341
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,200
under certain conditions it looks as if

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
the internal states

343
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
are encoding the external states and the

344
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
thing that allows that encoding to

345
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
happen is a special function or a

346
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
manifold that's called the

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,600
synchronization map which just maps

348
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
information from the internal to the

349
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
external

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
and the the conditions for this

351
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
happening is basically that information

352
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
that gets to the internal world is

353
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
basically conditionally independent of

354
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,000
the external world when that

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
conditioning is done on the interface so

356
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
the interface kind of statistically

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,959
insulates the internal from the external

358
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
and with that at play you can actually

359
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
have the internal states look as if

360
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
they're encoding the external states

361
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
so that's the gist of bayesian mechanics

362
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,079
without leaving out as much math as i as

363
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
we possibly can

364
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,000
so then basic mechanics research first

365
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
asked the question

366
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,040
what are the necessary and sufficient

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
conditions for that map to exist so

368
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,959
that's something that

369
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
the earlier paper bayesian mechanics for

370
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
stationary processes that's what it

371
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
explicitly explored what are the

372
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,959
mathematical conditions for us to be

373
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
justified in saying yeah that map

374
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
actually exists

375
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
and once we've answered this first aim

376
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
of basic mechanics then we can try to

377
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,079
actually look for hallmarks of bayesian

378
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,440
mechanics in real systems biotic and

379
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,680
abiotic alike so those are the kind of

380
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,160
two that the first thing is what is

381
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
basic mechanics what allows it to exist

382
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,839
and then the second thing is saying once

383
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,519
we know those conditions we can actually

384
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
look for that in the real world

385
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,240
okay so

386
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,199
to do this proper analysis of a system

387
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
um to to identify this three-way

388
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
partition internal blanket external you

389
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
need basically a probability

390
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
distribution over the states of our

391
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,959
system so that's what's denoted with

392
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,839
this p

393
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
probably a distribution that tells you

394
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
for every setting of mu

395
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
b and eta internal blanket external

396
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,120
what's the probability of that

397
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
particular configuration

398
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
so that's a kind of a tall order getting

399
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
a full probability distribution for any

400
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,839
system is not

401
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,959
um

402
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
is not trivial you know for some systems

403
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,399
it is trivial but for most of things

404
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
we're interested in we usually don't

405
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
have access to that

406
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
so um that's why a lot of the work in

407
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,480
this field so far has not been really

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
applied to actual empirical data because

409
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,560
it's so theoretical at this point and

410
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,199
very like in silico um so we're still at

411
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
that stage where we're still figuring

412
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
things out theoretically and we haven't

413
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,040
moved to like empirical application yet

414
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,959
mainly because of these these issues of

415
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,839
finding what that probability

416
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,360
distribution um so

417
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
that's basic mechanics and now to move

418
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
from there to stochastic processes we're

419
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,160
motivated by the fact that in the case

420
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,519
we need to find this probability

421
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,959
distribution

422
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,360
and the internal blanket and external

423
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
states change over time i.e they're

424
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
dynamic

425
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,079
then we need to move to the realm of

426
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
stochastic processes and the reason that

427
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,720
is is because stochastic differential

428
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
equations

429
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
are the mathematical construct that

430
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
allow us to write down a probability

431
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
distribution over variables that change

432
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
over time

433
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,240
so a way to express that is using a

434
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
stochastic differential equation this is

435
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,279
the basic

436
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,480
a basic kind of abstract formalism for

437
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
understanding probability distributions

438
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,680
over paths or over sequences of states

439
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
over time that's really what a

440
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
stochastic process is but we like to

441
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,519
formally

442
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,920
summarize that that probability

443
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
distribution using this kind of

444
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
differential equation and all this

445
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,279
differential equation is saying is that

446
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
the rate of change of some state

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
is a function of the state

448
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
so it's basically a deterministic

449
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
function of the state

450
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
where where i'm going is a function of

451
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,079
where i am

452
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
plus some random noise and the random

453
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
noise is just

454
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,000
basically there to

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
to incorporate the fact that i don't

456
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
know my position

457
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,839
with certainty over time i have some

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,759
sense that's given by that deterministic

459
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,160
flow but overall there's uncertainty in

460
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
where i'll be next so we capture all

461
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
that uncertainty with this thing noise

462
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,240
and that's the basic structure of any

463
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
stochastic process or stochastic

464
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
differential equation

465
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,399
okay so

466
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
now we're going to zoom in on to this

467
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,000
this flow component which is the

468
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
deterministic part of the stochastic

469
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,480
process so here after when i say flow or

470
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,079
drift we're referring to the

471
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,120
deterministic part of this flow equip of

472
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
this stochastic differential equation

473
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,720
we're going to take that and we're going

474
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
to expand it to give it a new

475
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
interpretation that will allow us to get

476
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
back to our original goal which is

477
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
writing down a probability distribution

478
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
so that we can do bayesian mechanics

479
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,880
so the the interpretation that allows us

480
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,639
to make those moves is called the

481
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
helmholtz decomposition and it's

482
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
basically saying that any

483
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
that any flow

484
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,119
of a stochastic differential equation

485
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
there are a few conditions on the flow

486
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
that we can get into they're kind of

487
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,240
technical conditions but if this flow

488
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,919
meets those basic conditions which are

489
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
quite general then you can decompose it

490
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
into the sum of two parts

491
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
one is called the reversible part of the

492
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
flow and the other one is called the

493
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,760
irreversible part of the flow

494
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,199
and we'll get into now what that

495
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
actually means so the the first one is

496
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
called the reversible part of the flow

497
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
and it can basically be seen as a

498
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,919
gradient flow

499
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,400
towards the maximum of the probability

500
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
density of the whole system so that

501
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
probability distribution we talked about

502
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
at the beginning it has peaks and

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
valleys right there's areas of higher

504
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,679
density and lower density this

505
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,919
reversible part of the flow is just

506
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,400
telling the system bring me to the local

507
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
maxima or to the peaks of that

508
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
probability density

509
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
this is also referred to as dissipative

510
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,280
or time reversible because a system

511
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,840
that's driven by this gradient flow has

512
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
time um

513
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,679
reversibility or time symmetry in the

514
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,520
sense that if you run one version of the

515
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
process forwards in time it'll look the

516
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
same ran backwards

517
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,679
and the important part here is that it's

518
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
tightly related to the noise or the

519
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,919
random fluctuations that we talked about

520
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
from earlier so the strength of the

521
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
force that pushes you towards

522
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
the maxima of your probability density

523
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,360
is directly proportional to the

524
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,000
amplitude or the variance of the noise

525
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
so that's a very interesting concept um

526
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
that might be a little counterintuitive

527
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
at first but basically those random

528
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
fluctuations that we're adding

529
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,240
to the the flow in the um langevin

530
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,520
equation

531
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
how big those fluctuations are

532
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
determines how quickly or with what

533
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,039
force we get to the probability density

534
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,720
is maxima

535
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
which you might think that's a little

536
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
weird why would more noise actually make

537
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,520
us get to where we're going faster

538
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
wouldn't that push us away from our path

539
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
but if you think about averages and

540
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,760
think about the density of paths trying

541
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
to get somewhere in probably density the

542
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
more noise you have actual more chances

543
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
the system has to kind of explore state

544
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
space and then reach its eventual um

545
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,240
average like steady state density faster

546
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
so that's one part is this um

547
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
gradient flow this dissipative flow

548
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
that's who's whose strength is is uh

549
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
proportional to the amplitude of random

550
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
fluctuations

551
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,039
and then secondly we have this more

552
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
interesting thing which is called the

553
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
conservative or time irreversible

554
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
component also called the solenoidal

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
flow

556
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,240
and this is mediated by this

557
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
anti-symmetric operator called q

558
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
and this basically doesn't point either

559
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
in the direction of the minima or the

560
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
maxima of the probability density of the

561
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
system but rather it points you along

562
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
the iso contours of equal probability of

563
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,880
that density so this is the kind of

564
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
circus component of the flow

565
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
and it's very interesting from the

566
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
perspective of thermodynamics because

567
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
systems with

568
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
this time irreversibility they um

569
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
exhibit positive entry production for

570
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
instance

571
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
and they uh and they basically have

572
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
conservative dynamics

573
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
so here's an example on the left of the

574
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
stochastic process that's just driven by

575
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
gradient flow with some noise on top of

576
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
it and you can see that it's kind of

577
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
ascending or running parallel to the the

578
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,919
probability density and then on the

579
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,760
right we have a deterministic system

580
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
that's just driven by solenoidal flow

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,679
and it kind of acts like a celestial

582
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,159
body like a planet that's orbiting on

583
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,559
some center of gravity

584
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,559
uh and i should say that the blue

585
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,080
background on each plot is basically

586
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,159
showing how high the probability density

587
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
is of the states um at each point in

588
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
state space so this is just a two

589
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
dimensional system

590
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
so the helmholtz decomposition is saying

591
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,760
that you can take these two components

592
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
and together they form the full dynamic

593
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
of any stochastic system

594
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
so the full dynamic has components of

595
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
trying to get to the maxima of the

596
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
probability density and then it also has

597
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
components of kind of surfing the iso

598
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
contours of probability density and all

599
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
of this is subject to random

600
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
fluctuations that are kind of knocking

601
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
it off the path so you can get kind of

602
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
rich dynamics with just this very simple

603
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,600
decomposition of any system's flow

604
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
um so this is another way that we can

605
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
visualize these things in terms of

606
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
vector fields so on the left i'm showing

607
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
the solenoidal flow like the strength of

608
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
that component at each point in state

609
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,880
space so x and y are just the two levels

610
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,080
of some two-dimensional random variable

611
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,159
here are the components of the

612
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
dissipative flow

613
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
and you can see that they're parallel to

614
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
the gradients that pull you towards or

615
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,080
away from the center of the probability

616
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
density

617
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
and then if you add these two things

618
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,840
together

619
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,919
then you get the the force that's

620
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
driving the system at every point in

621
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,000
state space which is this combination of

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
this kind of orbiting um fluctuation as

623
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
well as this thing that's pulling it

624
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
towards the center and just a kind of

625
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
technical note the ra the reason that

626
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,840
the dissipative flow looks like it's

627
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
pointing away from the center in the

628
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
middle plot

629
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,039
but it's pointing to the center and the

630
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,559
right plot is because there's a minus

631
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,000
sign in front of the dissipative

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
operator on the right paw so that's an

633
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
important thing that often uh confuses

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
people

635
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
so now we've done this decomposition we

636
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,280
have this gradient flow we have the

637
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,240
solenoidal flow

638
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
um and and the the thing that brings us

639
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,360
back to

640
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
bayesian mechanics is this important

641
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
point that i left out which is that the

642
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
gradient fill in the solenoidal flow

643
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
they don't just operate on the state of

644
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,480
the system but they operate

645
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
on the gradient of the probability

646
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,760
density which is given by this kind of

647
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
weird i slash j operator which we can

648
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,799
just call the surprisal

649
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
so the surprisal is defined as the

650
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,520
negative log of the probability density

651
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
it's also known in physics as a scalar

652
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
potential and this just says how

653
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,039
basically tells you how far away you are

654
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,559
in some sense from the center of the

655
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,480
probability density it's saying what is

656
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
the local curvature right now how steep

657
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
is the probability landscape at the

658
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,760
point i am right now

659
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
so this in turn these are the things

660
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,919
that scale the the dissipative and the

661
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,520
solenoidal operators and this thing in

662
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
turn can be formally related to the

663
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
steady state distribution of the process

664
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
this probability density over mu

665
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
b and eta that we were originally

666
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,320
interested in so it because it's the

667
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
negative log of that density you can

668
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
exponentiate its negative and you get

669
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
yourself back to the density and that's

670
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,240
excluding something that's called a

671
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,559
partition function but that density is

672
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,480
called the non-equilibrium steady state

673
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,600
density

674
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,320
and the existence of that

675
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,159
is kind of fundamental to the whole free

676
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
energy principle bayesian mechanics

677
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
thing if a system has this nest density

678
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,679
then the system can achieve bayesian

679
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,279
mechanics

680
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,679
and another important point is if q is

681
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,120
non-zero

682
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
the system truly is non-equilibrium if

683
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,559
it is zero if the q does not exist and

684
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
there's only dissipative currents the

685
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
system is known as an equilibrium system

686
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
and it just has an equilibrium steady

687
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,080
state so the q is basically what

688
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
mediates all the things that we're

689
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,919
interested in biological systems like

690
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,000
the breaking of detail balance

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,159
positive entropy production rate and

692
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
time irreversibility that's all kind of

693
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,640
built baked into the system with q

694
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
um so the main point of all these slides

695
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,720
on stochastic processes helmholtz

696
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
decomposition is just the fact that that

697
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
deterministic flow component of the

698
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
longitude equation

699
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
can be rewritten in terms of gradients

700
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
of its log stationary density so it

701
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,320
looks as if any stochastic process is

702
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
basically being dragged towards its

703
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
stationary density subject to random

704
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
noise and these solenoidal um components

705
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
that kind of drive it along the iso

706
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
contours

707
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
so we can now kind of take the steps

708
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
required to rewrite our full lines of n

709
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,679
equation using this new interpretation

710
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,440
so first you have this flow operator

711
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
which is just a combination of the

712
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
irreversible and reversible components

713
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
then you can plug that into our

714
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
expression for f which is the flow so

715
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,799
it's the flow operator times the

716
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,400
gradients of the log density the

717
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
negative log density and then minus this

718
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
extra term that i'll talk about in in a

719
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,880
few minutes

720
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
and then you can just combine all this

721
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
together

722
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
plug it back into the login equation and

723
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,080
now we have an expression for the login

724
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
equation namely the rate of change of

725
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,080
the state in terms of a gradient descent

726
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,360
on the um on this surprisal so basically

727
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,880
all this is saying is that a system

728
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
looks like it's trying to minimize the

729
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,760
surprisal of its states i.e find itself

730
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
in parts of state space that are the

731
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
least surprising or have the highest

732
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
probability

733
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,640
so as i just mentioned there's this

734
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,880
extra term that we haven't talked about

735
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,799
it's kind of called this housekeeping or

736
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
correction term and this i think has

737
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
come up in a few of the the past live

738
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
streams if i remember correctly and this

739
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
is going to be really important for the

740
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
current paper kind of mediates all the

741
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
interesting things that we see in in

742
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
things like stochastic chaos so

743
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
this is called what carl calls in the

744
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
paper the housekeeping term

745
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,520
and it only arises in the case that

746
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
those solenoidal and dissipative

747
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
matrices depend on the state of the

748
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,039
system

749
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,640
so for these earlier papers we were

750
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
talking about like the bayesian

751
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,039
mechanics

752
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
for stationary processes and the

753
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
miguel's paper as well as

754
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,520
the memory markov blankets paper those

755
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,360
three papers for the most part assume

756
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,840
that these matrices were constant in the

757
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,279
sense that they don't depend on the

758
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,320
states

759
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,799
that's what makes a system a linear

760
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,480
versus a non-linear system if these

761
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
matrices are constant then the system is

762
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,559
linear if they are not constant in the

763
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
states i.e they depend on the part of

764
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
state space you're in

765
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
then it's a non-linear system and this

766
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,120
housekeeping term is non-zero it

767
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,039
actually has some influence on the

768
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,039
dynamics

769
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,279
so this is something that is figures

770
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,960
into the current paper on the lorenz

771
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
attractor so lorenz attractor which

772
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
we'll get into later is a non-linear

773
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
system so this housekeeping term becomes

774
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
non-zero

775
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,039
and for if anyone's technically

776
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,320
interested that's just what it looks

777
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,919
like it's it's basically a type of

778
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,559
matrix field divergence which is a

779
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,880
mouthful but it's basically a sum of

780
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,120
partial derivatives of the matrix field

781
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
across different

782
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
state variables

783
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
so given that we can now in in the case

784
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,240
of a non-linear system where the q

785
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,720
matrix actually depends on the state

786
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
now we're showing the solenoidal

787
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,640
operator as a function of state space

788
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,399
and you can see that now the solenoidal

789
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,640
flow actually depends on which which

790
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
part of the xy plane you're in

791
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,679
here denoted x1 x2

792
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,279
the dissipative operator i've kept

793
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,000
constant just to be simple

794
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
and then you have additionally this

795
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
housekeeping term

796
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
that is also a function of state space

797
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,600
and it's kind of actually counteracting

798
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
in some sense the dissipative operator

799
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
and it's a weird combination of kind of

800
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,440
flows that are pulling you towards the

801
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
center as well as away from the center

802
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
and then the full dynamic is going to be

803
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
this combination between a housekeeping

804
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,399
term

805
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,320
the solenoidal term and the dissipative

806
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
term altogether so these are the kind of

807
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,799
systems that you're going to more likely

808
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
encounter in the real world service

809
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
because most real-world systems are

810
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,039
non-linear they can't be described with

811
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,279
nice uh ornstein ulenbach processes

812
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,200
where the housekeeping term disappears

813
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
okay so that was our big detour into

814
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,000
helmholtz decomposition and it was a lot

815
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
of math and theory but it'll actually

816
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,799
become

817
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
concrete when we apply it to that to the

818
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
lorenz attractor so now let's go back to

819
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,600
our our desired um goal of getting that

820
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
probability distribution

821
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
so we want a probability distribution

822
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,520
over mu internal states blanket states

823
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
external states so that we can do

824
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,840
bayesian mechanics

825
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,279
and now we're going to say that our

826
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,840
system of interest x is just

827
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,960
a 3 a 3d system a 3 vector that's

828
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
comprised of internal blanket external

829
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,760
at every time so we want to have a 3d

830
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,360
probability distribution over those

831
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,679
variables

832
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,120
so once we have that probability

833
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,679
distribution we can basically do what's

834
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,480
called

835
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
marginalize the density and find

836
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
conditional density so we can say give

837
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,039
me the conditional density over internal

838
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,799
given blanket states give me the

839
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
conditional density over external given

840
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,600
blanket states those two densities are

841
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
theoretically the things that get mapped

842
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,640
to each other through the

843
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,559
synchronization map so that's something

844
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
i didn't really mention in the beginning

845
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,399
with this theoretical kind of more

846
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,919
semantic description of bayesian

847
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,039
mechanics

848
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
but technically basic mechanics has to

849
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,440
do with conditional densities it says

850
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
tell me condition on some level of the

851
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,320
blanket states what is the most likely

852
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
value of the internal states and if you

853
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
know that and you have a synchronization

854
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
map you can kind of guess the most

855
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,399
likely value of the external states

856
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,480
condition on blanket states so the

857
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,399
synchronization map is really mapping

858
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
the two conditional densities to each

859
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
other

860
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
quick question

861
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
so at that point

862
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,640
can we do because you've used phrases

863
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,320
like zoom in

864
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
and zoom out and when you talk about

865
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
decomposition

866
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
do we know

867
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,559
where

868
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,399
on on the scaler

869
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,080
that

870
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
will this tell us where

871
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,679
something is

872
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,159
focused or versus something that's

873
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,799
looking at horizons

874
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,480
do you know what i'm saying like can we

875
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440
tell

876
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,320
what the field is based on this that

877
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,760
that the thing is

878
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,000
trying to map

879
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
and when you say

880
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
horizons do you mean like temporal

881
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
horizons or do you mean more spatial you

882
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,159
know i'm i'm saying like can we tell

883
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,279
whether it's

884
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
it's it's zooming in on a focal point or

885
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,519
whether it's it's looking at a larger

886
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,640
picture

887
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,159
oh i see time wise and and map wise so

888
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,279
yeah so the the map technically is very

889
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,200
focal in the sense that

890
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
i haven't shown it in the lower right

891
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,600
because i didn't want to get too

892
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
technical but the synchronization map

893
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,039
technically

894
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,240
maps um the sufficient statistics of the

895
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
densities together so it maps a

896
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,840
particular point on a statistical

897
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,039
manifold

898
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,799
so when i say statistical manifold i

899
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
mean a space that is not spanned by the

900
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,039
values of the system but actually by the

901
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
expected values or the averages of the

902
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,039
system so it says

903
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,720
on average

904
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
the internal states will get mapped to

905
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
the external states so in that sense

906
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
it's kind of a point because you're

907
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,799
saying i'm point i'm i'm mapping from a

908
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,440
most likely value or from an average

909
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
to another average on the other side of

910
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,080
the blanket but it's so in that sense

911
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,519
you're kind of doing a dimensionality

912
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,360
reduction because the map is not defined

913
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,279
for any particular little

914
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,279
fluctuation of the internal or the

915
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,440
external like some particular instance

916
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
but it's actually really defined on this

917
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,519
average level so you're only going to be

918
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
seeing the inference when you take

919
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,679
averages across multiple noisy

920
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,440
realizations

921
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
um connor if i could ask one more

922
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,519
question to kind of lock in the gains of

923
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,840
this great section is it fair to say

924
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
that the synchronization map is

925
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,799
literally the internal states map of the

926
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,519
external states territory

927
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,080
yeah exactly okay

928
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,559
the synchronization map will

929
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,440
take any internal state and it will map

930
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,159
it

931
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,279
into

932
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
a map like it'll map it into a space and

933
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,200
that space is a map of the the external

934
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,519
states territory and it might not be

935
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
correct you know it could be off but

936
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,440
it's basically taking any internal state

937
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,799
and it's projecting it into a

938
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,000
representation and that representations

939
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,640
um metric space like when i move around

940
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
in that represented space is supposed to

941
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,279
mirror how external states are actually

942
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,399
moving

943
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,159
um and the key point of the

944
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,080
synchronization map is the map in the

945
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,480
territory will only be aligned

946
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,440
on average but for any given particular

947
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,679
instance of the internal states that

948
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,080
guess where that place it gets mapped to

949
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,159
on the on the map on the representation

950
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,320
might be arbitrarily far

951
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
from the true external state that's

952
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,399
going on at that time but on average

953
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,279
they'll be exactly on top of each other

954
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,480
and there's one

955
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,200
comment in the chat from miguel aguilera

956
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
so i'm gonna read it to you conor and

957
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,519
you can address it now or if it comes

958
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,120
at a better time later then address it

959
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,519
then so miguel writes

960
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
great introduction of the helmholtz

961
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,799
decomposition

962
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,600
how general is the housekeeping lambda

963
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
term can it account for any non-linear

964
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
systems with higher order terms for

965
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,840
example larger than quadratic

966
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,159
that's a great question um yes it

967
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,919
totally can

968
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,159
uh

969
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
so if we go back to it

970
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,678
where was it

971
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,639
let's address it now if that's okay with

972
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,599
me done

973
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,480
yeah

974
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
yeah so if you look at this a

975
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,239
housekeeping term it's defined as this

976
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
divergence of the matrix field

977
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,239
and it's a sum of the partial

978
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,520
derivatives of the flow operator um so

979
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,960
now i'm talking about the last equation

980
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
on the slide the flow operator again is

981
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,719
the q minus the gamma

982
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,560
so those partial derivatives if they're

983
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,800
higher order than quadratic

984
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
they will

985
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,359
they will have

986
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,839
uh non-linear terms right so if you're

987
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,599
taking

988
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,119
uh the partial derivative of something

989
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,879
that has a third or a fourth order then

990
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,520
the partial derivative itself will be

991
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,239
non-linear so all that means is that the

992
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,480
housekeeping term itself will be

993
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
non-linear in the states so the

994
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,000
housekeeping term is also a function of

995
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
the states and in this case with higher

996
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,399
order ex

997
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,400
more than quadratic terms then you'll

998
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,079
just get a not an appropriately

999
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
non-linear housekeeping term um so for

1000
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,560
instance if we go back to this slide

1001
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
in the third um

1002
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
the third column the housekeeping term

1003
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
because i made the q matrix the

1004
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,079
solenoidal matrix

1005
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,079
a second order in the states i.e there's

1006
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,320
an interaction between x1 and x2 a

1007
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,160
multiplicative interaction the

1008
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,560
housekeeping term becomes linear in one

1009
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,640
of the two states so it's just a simple

1010
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,839
linear function of x1 and x2

1011
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,079
if however we are to imagine that either

1012
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,960
q

1013
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,119
or gamma gamma is the dissipative

1014
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,720
operator i made it constant for now but

1015
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
if one of those had a higher order term

1016
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,200
like a x to the third term or x square

1017
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,599
x1 squared times x2 then the

1018
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,760
housekeeping term would also have now a

1019
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,079
non-linear term and now housekeeping

1020
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,079
would be non-linear in the in the state

1021
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
space and there's nothing wrong with

1022
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
that it would just mean the housekeeping

1023
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
term would be non-linear and the

1024
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,920
dynamics would be even more complex um

1025
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,200
yeah that's a great question miguel

1026
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
thanks

1027
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,839
and if i could ask some follow-up

1028
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
housekeeping questions so

1029
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,760
uh one can the housekeeping

1030
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,000
be non-differentiable or what if there's

1031
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
some function that doesn't have a nice

1032
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,359
derivative and the second part is

1033
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,680
what does the housekeeping turn

1034
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
term represent

1035
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
for a given example system and how is it

1036
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,560
different than the regular helmholtz

1037
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,040
decomposition

1038
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
that's a good good question

1039
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,440
um so the first question is

1040
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,000
about differentiability so i mentioned

1041
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
in the beginning that for a system to

1042
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
have these nice things we were talking

1043
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,119
about like to basically be applied to

1044
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
the helmholtz decomposition to be

1045
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
applied to it etc

1046
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
one of the conditions is that the flow

1047
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
function that f of x is a smooth

1048
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
function of the states so as in

1049
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,960
basically means it's differentiable

1050
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
everywhere as long as the flow is

1051
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
differentiable it implies that all the

1052
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,839
sub components are also differentiable

1053
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
if my memory of calculus serves me well

1054
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
so basically it means that q will be

1055
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,240
differentiable which means that all its

1056
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,000
higher order derivatives are also

1057
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
differentiable so basically um

1058
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,480
the the the very premise of this

1059
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,400
decomposition assumes that things are

1060
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,079
differentiable so that that problem

1061
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,280
shouldn't arise or if there's

1062
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,880
non-differentiable

1063
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,240
flow function

1064
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,599
then you're right all these things will

1065
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,320
have discontinuities and and i don't

1066
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
think the solution or there there are

1067
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
any guarantees that the decomposition

1068
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,920
even applies in that case

1069
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,040
um

1070
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,359
the second question can you sorry can

1071
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,640
you remind me with the second one oh

1072
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,240
sorry yeah the interpretation of the

1073
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,920
housekeeping term that's a really good

1074
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
question i this is something we talked a

1075
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,560
lot about with carl um when

1076
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
when we discussed this paper at a tnb

1077
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,760
meeting like how do you interpret this

1078
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
because the solenoidal flow right i can

1079
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
imagine it's you're going along the iso

1080
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,599
contours dissipative makes sense you're

1081
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
going up and down the gradients of the

1082
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,359
density itself but the housekeeping term

1083
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,280
is this weird thing where it has to do

1084
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,880
with the derivatives

1085
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,119
of the state-dependent solenoidal and

1086
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,720
dissipative flow

1087
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,880
i don't know how to interpret it to be

1088
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
honest with you in terms of like one of

1089
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
these nice kind of orthogonality just

1090
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
because it's not an orthogonalization of

1091
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
this of the state space it's it's a

1092
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,960
mixture of both state-dependent

1093
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,560
solenoidal and dissipative terms

1094
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,280
the the one thing he did say that that

1095
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,160
carl said to us that uh that we'll come

1096
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
to later is that the housekeeping term

1097
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,320
in the case of chaotic dynamics is

1098
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,520
actually what mediates the wandering

1099
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,000
seemingly non-steady state-ish uh

1100
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,680
behavior of things like the lorenz

1101
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
attractor so the lorenz attractor seems

1102
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,920
to kind of go on these itinerant

1103
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,880
wandering so that are arbitrarily far

1104
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,800
from its steady state density whatever

1105
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
that state density is because again we

1106
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
don't know what it is and basically the

1107
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
housekeeping term in this case

1108
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,680
can push the system away from the

1109
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,760
gradients of the log density

1110
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,160
and also away from the level sets of the

1111
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,320
iso contours of the density given by the

1112
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,400
solenoid flow so an example of that is

1113
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
actually here right where you see in

1114
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,680
kind of the main

1115
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,160
xy planes of the if you compare the red

1116
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,640
plot to the purple plot the red arrows

1117
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,320
are actually pointing sometimes in the

1118
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,079
opposite arrows of the purple arrows so

1119
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,839
one interpretation is that for

1120
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,400
sufficiently complex systems sometimes

1121
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,839
they'll actually be quite strong

1122
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,000
components of the flow that are driving

1123
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
it away

1124
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,920
from the the probability density's

1125
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,119
maxima

1126
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,720
so this might actually if you want to

1127
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
try to interpret this in the context of

1128
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,960
biological systems systems sometimes

1129
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,520
seem to wander very far away from

1130
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
what in a greedy sense would be the the

1131
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
best state to be an i.e a local mode of

1132
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
the probability density and this

1133
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
housekeeping term can sometimes drive

1134
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,920
the system into long wandering sojourns

1135
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,520
that are far away from those local

1136
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,640
maxima

1137
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
um and and it's the strength of that

1138
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,720
housekeeping term versus the dissipative

1139
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,079
term that carl argues is actually the

1140
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,280
the the um helmholtz decomposition

1141
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
take on chaotic behavior so chaotic

1142
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,280
behavior is when things wander

1143
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,520
arbitrarily far basically because the

1144
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,680
housekeeping term dominates and pushes

1145
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,880
things away from the modes of the

1146
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,160
density

1147
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
that was the closest that i got to like

1148
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,280
a kind of interpretation of the

1149
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
housekeeping term but it's a really good

1150
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,040
question i would be curious to hear what

1151
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,560
other people um have to say about that

1152
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,720
um okay so

1153
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
yes so right this is where we work so

1154
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
we're talking about the synchronization

1155
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,079
map that's where we want to get to we

1156
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,160
want to get to being able to write down

1157
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
those conditional densities so that we

1158
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,079
can map them to each other and then

1159
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
imbue our system with some form of

1160
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
sentience

1161
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,960
or at least a sentient interpretation so

1162
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,880
how do we get this density so this

1163
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,160
brings us to the first major

1164
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,480
contribution of the paper which is a new

1165
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
method for approximating a system where

1166
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
we don't have that density so for

1167
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,400
instance the system we're about to talk

1168
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
about the lorenz attractor we don't know

1169
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
what the probability density is so we're

1170
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,520
going to use

1171
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,440
a new method proposing this paper to

1172
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
approximate that density

1173
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
um and the method used to approximate

1174
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,640
the density relies on a combination of

1175
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,119
polynomial regression as well as the

1176
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,520
helmholtz decomposition so that's why i

1177
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,359
just spent so much time going through

1178
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,440
the helmholtz decomposition because this

1179
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,359
new method proposed by the paper for

1180
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
fitting the density relies on the

1181
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,280
helmholtz decomposition as well as

1182
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,640
basically

1183
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,359
some

1184
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,440
some statistical inference techniques or

1185
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,160
polynomial regression

1186
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
so now we're going to actually make

1187
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
things specific and dive into a

1188
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,720
particular system

1189
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
so the lorenz attractor

1190
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
a phase space portrait of it is shown in

1191
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
the top left is a famous deterministic

1192
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,400
dynamical system that exhibits what's

1193
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,200
known as chaos and again i'm gonna not

1194
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,280
go too into depth here to save time and

1195
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,160
um

1196
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
last time in one of the early early

1197
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,079
streams daniel gave a very nice

1198
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,000
explanation of chaotic behavior but it

1199
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,839
basically means

1200
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,560
when you very slightly alter the initial

1201
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,319
conditions of the system

1202
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,280
the end up and resulting trajectory can

1203
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,760
can can be arbitrarily far in state

1204
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,160
space so if i start the system at

1205
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,880
setting point one versus point one zero

1206
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,359
one the resulting place that those two

1207
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,040
trajectories end up can be super far

1208
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,440
away from each other so it's quantified

1209
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,160
um most often by analyzing what's known

1210
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,079
as the eigenvalues of the jacobian or

1211
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,800
the lyapunov x point um the sign of

1212
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,680
which will tell you how far systems on

1213
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,200
how far trajectories on average should

1214
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,720
diverge and that's kind of the hallmark

1215
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,000
of chaos

1216
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,520
so that's the lorenz attractor it gives

1217
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,000
these nice um kind of itinerant

1218
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
wandering butterfly lobes when you look

1219
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,839
at its trajectories over time the

1220
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,319
interesting property is that no same one

1221
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,560
trajectory is is the same for a slightly

1222
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
different initial condition that's why

1223
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,319
we call it chaotic

1224
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,160
what we study in this

1225
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,040
paper is exactly that deterministic

1226
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,680
chaotic system but we just add noise

1227
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,920
onto its flow function so that's what's

1228
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,079
represented with the equations here so

1229
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,079
we can call it the stochastic lorenz

1230
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,599
attractor it's kind of uh it's not um

1231
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,400
it's not

1232
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,480
been characterized super rigorously as

1233
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,560
much as the lorenz attractor has been so

1234
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,960
it's a kind of interesting experimental

1235
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
stochastic process to

1236
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
to investigate here so on the bottom

1237
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,119
right we see the original stochastic

1238
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,599
lorenz flows which is a nonlinear

1239
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,079
deterministic dynamical system that's

1240
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,319
that f x and what we're doing here is

1241
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,000
we're just perturbing the system at

1242
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,319
every time with a little random gaussian

1243
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,400
fluctuation that's what's represented by

1244
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,520
omega

1245
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,119
and i've bolded everything here to

1246
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,400
represent that where now we're dealing

1247
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,800
with a vector space of state so we're

1248
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,359
dealing with x1 x2 x3 it's not just a

1249
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:52,160
single variable but it's a 3d um system

1250
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
okay so now we can get into the major

1251
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,920
moves of the actual paper so the first

1252
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,000
approach is to say okay we know about

1253
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
this helmholtz decomposition thing let's

1254
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,599
try to rewrite the lorenz attractor as

1255
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,920
if it's doing a gradient

1256
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,640
ascent on a log probability density or a

1257
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,400
gradient descent on on surprisal

1258
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
so an important thing to note here is

1259
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,319
the surprisal as well as the flow

1260
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,240
operator the q and the gamma are state

1261
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,720
dependent and as we know now from our

1262
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,400
discussion of the housekeeping term

1263
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,000
we're going to get that extra lambda

1264
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,280
term

1265
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,359
because the system is state dependent

1266
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
and you can just look at the flows from

1267
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,040
lorenz attractor to see that very

1268
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,160
clearly so for instance f of x is not

1269
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
just first order in the state so that

1270
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,240
would mean it would be a linear system

1271
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,200
but for instance the the flow of x2

1272
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,720
depends on the multiplicative

1273
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,440
interaction between x1 and x3 and

1274
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,920
likewise the flow of x3 depends on the

1275
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,839
multiplicative interaction between x1

1276
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,720
and x2 that state dependence

1277
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,880
will be exactly recapitulating the fact

1278
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,359
that q and gamma will not be a constant

1279
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,280
function of the states and because of

1280
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,040
that we'll also get this housekeeping

1281
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,119
term this big lambda on the on the side

1282
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,079
so that's why the lorenz attractor was

1283
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,079
chosen as opposed to an ou process

1284
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,280
exactly because it has this

1285
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,319
non-linearity the state dependence

1286
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,920
so if we want to write down an ou

1287
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,880
process

1288
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,800
and this is a decomposition that people

1289
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,720
like miguel know very well by now you

1290
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,040
can just write it down as this linear

1291
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,119
matrix function which is just q which is

1292
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,319
a matrix

1293
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,720
minus gamma and other matrix multiplied

1294
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,440
by the gradients of a gaussian

1295
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,520
probability density a log gaussian

1296
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,440
okay so the first approach um to tackle

1297
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,359
decomposing the lorenz attractor as if

1298
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
it's doing a gradient descent is

1299
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,240
basically fitting that dependency so

1300
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,440
fitting q and gamma using polynomial

1301
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
expansions so assume we didn't know the

1302
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,079
true lorenz flows and we just want to

1303
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,160
basically fit okay if i want to express

1304
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,839
the lorenz flows in terms of a q and

1305
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,079
gamma what would i do the first approach

1306
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,200
is to

1307
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,800
first of all take our state space which

1308
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,000
is x1 x2 x3 and expand it in terms of

1309
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
polynomial um basis functions which

1310
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,720
again is something i think was covered

1311
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,160
in an earlier live stream it's also

1312
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,920
known as a taylor expansion where we're

1313
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
saying i'm going to express each state

1314
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,960
of the system not as x1 x2 x3 but things

1315
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,680
like x1 squared x1 x2 x1 x2 x3 all these

1316
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,240
interaction terms and higher order terms

1317
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,000
and then i'm going to say

1318
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,920
find me a function that maps from that

1319
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,400
high order basis in terms of polynomial

1320
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,079
expansions to the coefficients of q and

1321
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
gamma respectively

1322
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,079
and i'm also going to model this

1323
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,839
surprisal function

1324
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,920
which is the negative log of the density

1325
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,040
as a function of the polynomial states

1326
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,800
so the the problem of polynomial

1327
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,839
regression is just finding finding the

1328
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
coefficients here q and h

1329
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,880
that

1330
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
need to be multiplied by these

1331
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,440
polynomial expansions in order to fit

1332
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,160
the observed flow as as best possible so

1333
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,720
this is a very common technique used in

1334
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
data science right instead of just doing

1335
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
a linear regression between

1336
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,680
um let's say housing prices and the size

1337
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,760
of the house you add in higher order

1338
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
terms like the squared size of the house

1339
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,920
or the size of the house times the size

1340
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
of the pool or whatever so it's like a

1341
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,079
very classic thing is to use polynomial

1342
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,160
expansions to get more expressive

1343
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,880
functions to explain some observed data

1344
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,319
so we're doing the same thing here

1345
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,000
except that the data we're trying to

1346
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,559
explain is the actual flow of the system

1347
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,640
so what the first move of the paper is

1348
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,119
is to actually do this fitting process

1349
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,880
and to and figure out that you can

1350
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,800
rewrite

1351
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,680
the deterministic lorenz system

1352
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,720
as if it's doing a gradient descent on

1353
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,040
this surpriso function but as we'll see

1354
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,400
later it's actually not a proper

1355
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,760
surprisal so we can just call it a

1356
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,079
potential function for now and basically

1357
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,319
that the solution is a second order

1358
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,680
function of the state so there's a

1359
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,240
multiplicative term between x1 and x2

1360
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,559
with coefficient h5 and then there's a

1361
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,520
linear term in x3

1362
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,839
and then what this means is that if you

1363
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,920
do this for the deterministic system so

1364
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,200
you actually assume the random

1365
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
fluctuations go to zero then what you

1366
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,079
can do is rewrite the parameters of the

1367
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,000
lorenz attractor which are given by

1368
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
sigma beta and rho these are the classic

1369
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,319
ways that people just parameterize the

1370
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,240
lorenz attractor and you know certain

1371
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
settings of row and beta lead to chaos

1372
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,599
and different kinds of attractors

1373
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,520
you can rewrite them in terms of the

1374
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,880
coefficients of the helmholtz

1375
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,880
decomposition so that's the first major

1376
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,079
move is that this hum holds

1377
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,319
decomposition can be used

1378
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,800
to write down the system's flows as if

1379
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,480
it's doing a gradient descent on a

1380
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,960
potential function

1381
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
there's a problem with this though which

1382
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,000
is that

1383
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,599
if we look at that potential it's

1384
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,280
actually not a proper probability

1385
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,200
distribution so this isn't really

1386
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,440
bayesian mechanics this first move all

1387
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,680
it's saying is that we can

1388
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,599
force the helmholtz decomposition to

1389
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,160
explain the flow function of the lorentz

1390
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
attractor but the resulting surprisal

1391
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,400
function we're left with is actually not

1392
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,640
a proper probability distribution

1393
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,800
and you if you just analyze that

1394
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,040
equation and try to interpret it like a

1395
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
probability uh function it won't

1396
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,880
actually work

1397
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,400
so that has to do with whether it's

1398
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,920
positive the gradients are positive

1399
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,480
definite essentially

1400
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,480
so that motivates the next move

1401
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,960
which is um where we don't try to

1402
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,440
approximate the lorenz attractor exactly

1403
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
but we try to approximate what car

1404
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,000
refers to as a laplace approximation to

1405
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
the steady state density

1406
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
so here instead of saying okay let's

1407
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,760
rewrite the lorenzo tractor as helmholtz

1408
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,480
decomposed let's assume that the lorenz

1409
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,119
attractor is dragged towards a steady

1410
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,520
state that's gaussian so the nest is a

1411
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,920
multivariate gaussian and if we force

1412
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,760
that assumption on and then use our

1413
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,480
polynomial regression what is the kind

1414
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
of resulting

1415
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,280
coefficients that we'll get because now

1416
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,680
we're forcing the system to look as if

1417
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,520
it's doing a gradient descent on a

1418
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,480
proper surprisal function or a gradient

1419
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,079
ascent on a proper probability

1420
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,400
distribution

1421
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,200
um

1422
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,880
so if you do that constraint and then

1423
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
you fit the helmholtz decomposition so

1424
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
again we're fitting the coefficients of

1425
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,160
the flow operator q and gamma in terms

1426
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
of the states using polynomial

1427
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,160
expansions of the states and we're

1428
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,480
constraining the surprisal function to

1429
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,200
be quadratic i.e the steady state is

1430
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,559
gaussian

1431
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,280
then we basically create not a perfect

1432
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,440
recapitulation of the stochastic lorenz

1433
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,359
system but something that looks like the

1434
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,599
lorenz system with this weird constraint

1435
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,160
that it has to be occupying on average a

1436
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
gaussian steady state which is not

1437
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,760
necessarily true of the real lorenz

1438
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,040
system that's an interesting move here

1439
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,599
um and then what you get is again what

1440
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,040
is referred to as the laplace

1441
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,640
approximation into the stochastic

1442
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,440
lorentz system which can be validated in

1443
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,119
terms of how close it is to the real

1444
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,200
lorenz system using things like the

1445
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,040
hausdorff dimension which is a

1446
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,640
quantification of the fractal

1447
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
dimensionality of the system so it's

1448
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,160
very well known that lorenz attractor

1449
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,480
basically lives on a fractal uh

1450
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,040
sub-manifold of its ambient state space

1451
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,800
which is quantified by a fractal

1452
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,720
hausdorff dimension or a non-integer

1453
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,640
halsdorf dimension and that's just a

1454
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,720
function of again of the eigenvalues of

1455
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,599
the jacobian of the mate of the flow and

1456
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,559
then he also validates the uh the

1457
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,880
approximation quality by just looking at

1458
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,040
how correlated the approximate flow is

1459
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,280
using this polynomial method with the

1460
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
true flow which is on the x-axis of that

1461
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,880
correlation plot

1462
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
and then on the right hand we have some

1463
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,200
example trajectories of this laplace

1464
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,839
approximated lorenz system

1465
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,880
so this is a very interesting um kind of

1466
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,400
plot because it's showing that even

1467
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,480
though the the underlying gauss

1468
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,240
underlying steady state density is a

1469
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,079
multivariate gaussian

1470
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,000
you can see that the actual trajectories

1471
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
of the system don't necessarily look

1472
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,079
like they're just neatly sitting or

1473
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,240
wandering around that gaussian state

1474
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,400
again because of the solenoidal flow and

1475
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,079
because of that housekeeping term which

1476
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,920
is very large in this case the

1477
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,160
trajectories of the system look as if

1478
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,319
they're making very like itinerant

1479
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,800
wandering trajectories but on average if

1480
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,640
you're to take a very infinite time

1481
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,880
observation of the system the system

1482
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,800
would still look as if it sits on a

1483
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,880
gaussian steady state

1484
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,720
so that's like the first i would say

1485
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,680
major move of the paper is doing this

1486
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,160
laplace approximate uh

1487
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,720
gaussian version of the lorenz attractor

1488
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,960
the stochastic lorenz attractor which

1489
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,720
anecdotally has some features of the

1490
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,559
lorenz attractor like it has these two

1491
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,559
lobes and all of these

1492
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,000
quantifications kind of make it

1493
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,760
correlated but it's not exactly the

1494
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,280
lorenz attractor because we're putting

1495
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,680
constraints on it

1496
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,800
um

1497
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,160
that was a lot of information is are

1498
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,759
there any comments or questions so far

1499
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,079
okay so i'll just keep going

1500
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,079
um so importantly

1501
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,160
now that we've rewritten the the nest

1502
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,480
density as if it's gaussian

1503
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,640
we can use it to read off conditional

1504
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,480
independent structure i.e the markov

1505
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,599
blanket

1506
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,480
and the reason that is is is uh obvious

1507
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,040
basically from earlier papers like this

1508
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,559
uh

1509
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,000
bayesian mechanics for stationary

1510
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,280
processes and miguel's paper on um

1511
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
on also on linear diffusion systems

1512
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,839
where basically you can just look at the

1513
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,079
hessian or the inverse of the covariance

1514
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,720
matrix and you can use that to read off

1515
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,720
conditional independence i.e to read off

1516
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,319
the mark of blanket

1517
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,160
and that is only that simple

1518
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,640
relationship between the inverse

1519
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,720
covariance and the markov blanket only

1520
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
obtains because of the gaussian nature

1521
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,559
of the steady state density

1522
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,800
so that's why the laplace approximation

1523
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,559
works here or is a nice move to make

1524
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,240
because it means we can then

1525
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,240
write down or read off the markup

1526
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,480
blanket very easily and so the lower

1527
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,559
right is showing that the hessian and

1528
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,359
the covariance matrix and you can so the

1529
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,960
white here means very low values so what

1530
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,319
we immediately see is that there's

1531
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,559
basically a markov blanket between the

1532
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,200
first and the third states

1533
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,119
um conditioned on the on the second

1534
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,520
states or actually sorry rather that the

1535
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,880
first and second states are both

1536
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,480
conditionally independent of the third

1537
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,839
state

1538
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,440
so there's kind of a markov blanket

1539
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,280
between those two and and the third

1540
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,839
state this one isn't as nice as the

1541
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,599
coupled system as we'll see further

1542
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,880
because it's actually not clear what the

1543
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,720
blanket states are here this more seems

1544
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,200
just like marginal marginal uh lack of

1545
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,200
correlation

1546
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,240
um but

1547
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,880
so even though there's the like the

1548
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,280
third and second states are also kind of

1549
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,880
conditionally independent you can still

1550
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,359
treat the second state as a blanket

1551
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,599
state and you can basically parameterize

1552
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,160
a density over the first state given the

1553
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,240
second state so here we're writing down

1554
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,640
a synchronization map between the first

1555
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
and third states and this is symmetric

1556
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,960
so

1557
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,880
first can infer third or third current

1558
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,799
for a thirst uh first but the

1559
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,640
conditioning the blanket state is the

1560
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,920
second state

1561
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,760
so you can kind of see that if i just

1562
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,599
take the instantaneous value of the

1563
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,319
third state it's in some way performing

1564
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,319
a guess or making an estimate about the

1565
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,799
most likely value of the first state and

1566
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,280
this relationship goes vice versa and

1567
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,960
the only reason we can write down that

1568
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,720
function that maps between the first and

1569
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,880
the third is again because we have an

1570
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,200
expression for the covariance matrix

1571
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,799
which follows from the laplace

1572
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,240
approximation or the gaussian

1573
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,960
approximation to this uh stochastic

1574
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,839
lorenz attractor

1575
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,559
so um once that's been done the laplace

1576
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,839
approximation

1577
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,839
then the next move is kind of

1578
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,599
it's not a full analysis but it's

1579
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,520
showing that you can

1580
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,000
extend this to non-gaussian steady

1581
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,079
states and kind of make higher order

1582
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,760
approximations which might be called

1583
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,520
density learning so in a case when you

1584
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,520
don't know you don't have a parametric

1585
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,680
swarm for the state state density

1586
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,280
you can parameterize the surprise

1587
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,960
surprisal function and the helmholtz

1588
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,200
decomposition in such a way that you

1589
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,440
know that the resulting density is a

1590
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
proper probability distribution but you

1591
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,720
don't necessarily know what its neat

1592
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,119
parametric form is so the way he does

1593
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,280
this is basically by parameterizing the

1594
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,160
quadratic or the potential as quadratic

1595
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,240
but the covariance or the hessian of

1596
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,559
that quadratic potential is state

1597
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,480
dependent so it's almost like you're

1598
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,799
fitting locally linear um

1599
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,559
synchronization maps to different parts

1600
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,160
in the state space or you're fitting

1601
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,640
locally gaussian approximations so the

1602
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,640
way it does this is essentially

1603
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,280
i have a efficient parameterization of

1604
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,640
the covariance matrix of my steady state

1605
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
but that covariance is actually changing

1606
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,480
as a function of state space whereas in

1607
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,400
gaussians the covariance by definition

1608
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,160
is constant

1609
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,960
though

1610
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,559
by doing this you can basically achieve

1611
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,680
a nicer

1612
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,839
approximation to the true stochastic

1613
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,359
lorenz system

1614
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,280
where all the conditional densities are

1615
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,960
still

1616
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,119
gaussian but the full multivariate

1617
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,839
density is not necessarily calcium

1618
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,280
so that's basically what's shown in the

1619
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,599
right plot here is this higher order

1620
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,400
learned stochastic lorenz system but

1621
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,079
it's not clear in this case what the

1622
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,079
synchronization map would be because the

1623
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,680
synchronization map is not just going to

1624
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,440
be a simple

1625
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,760
uh function of the hessian because now

1626
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,000
the hessian is is changing over state

1627
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,319
space

1628
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,240
connor can i ask a question here yeah

1629
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,960
please so from the chat martin beal has

1630
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,040
asked is this right

1631
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,920
there are two approximations here one of

1632
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,400
the dynamics and one of the stationary

1633
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,400
state

1634
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,240
uh yes i would say that the

1635
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,559
approximations

1636
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,119
um are intrinsically tied together

1637
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,400
though because

1638
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,000
what you're doing here

1639
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,599
is you're

1640
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,280
approximating the the

1641
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,799
potential function

1642
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,920
and then that approximation directly

1643
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,319
factors into the approximation of the

1644
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,640
flow right so you're fitting in this

1645
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,559
case these kernel matrices these k

1646
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,760
matrices as being state dependent so the

1647
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,920
kernel matrix is basically a cholesky

1648
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,640
factor of the covariance matrix or

1649
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,559
really of the hessian here the precision

1650
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,760
matrix

1651
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,520
and the gradients of that will then

1652
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,599
factor into the parameterization of the

1653
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,920
flow right because the flow is defined

1654
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,680
in terms of the helmholtz decomposition

1655
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,559
which is

1656
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,280
q minus gamma times the gradients of the

1657
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,400
potential

1658
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,480
so however you fit the stationary

1659
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,880
density those coefficients that you fit

1660
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,720
will also factor in

1661
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
to the parameterization of the flow so

1662
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
in this case in the upper left

1663
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,520
i have the parameterization of the

1664
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,839
the density this quadratic function if i

1665
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,680
take the gradients with of that with

1666
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,920
respect to the states it'll essentially

1667
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,040
look like

1668
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,559
k transpose k times x minus mu or

1669
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,920
basically a precision weighted

1670
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,319
prediction error right where k transpose

1671
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,960
k is the precision and then x minus mu

1672
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,880
is the deviation of

1673
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,000
x from some mean vector

1674
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,920
so you're doing all that all that

1675
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,280
simultaneously you're doing both the

1676
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,359
parameterization of the steady state as

1677
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,440
well as the parameterization of the flow

1678
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,200
but you're doing it all just by trying

1679
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,960
to fit the flow

1680
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,119
with these coefficients but for free

1681
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,119
some of those coefficients you get out

1682
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,960
you can use them to write down a

1683
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,200
potential function

1684
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,119
which can be converted to a stationary

1685
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,599
density

1686
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,880
does that make sense yes and just on

1687
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,520
this slide what is pd

1688
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,160
oh sorry positive definite okay

1689
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,520
yep that's a good good point um so yeah

1690
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,760
because these kernel matrices are

1691
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,000
symmetric these k transpose times k

1692
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,440
they're symmetric

1693
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,040
um they're state dependent but they are

1694
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,119
always symmetric it means that their

1695
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,520
product will always be positive definite

1696
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,079
which means that the

1697
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,319
stationary density evaluated different

1698
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,880
points in state space we'll always have

1699
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,720
locally

1700
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,200
be locally convex i.e there's going to

1701
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,880
be some local mode but since that

1702
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,440
pd matrix is changing over state space

1703
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,400
you're going to basically have a

1704
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,880
multimodal density but locally it'll be

1705
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,559
unimodal that's another way of

1706
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,240
expressing everything on the left side

1707
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
okay so here's the more interesting part

1708
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
where we can really start talking about

1709
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,760
like the interesting bayesian mechanical

1710
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760
inferential interpretations

1711
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,480
where now we have two coupled um lorenz

1712
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,640
systems so again it's a stochastic

1713
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,480
lorenz system but since we have two of

1714
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,319
them that are talking to each other it's

1715
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:41,119
really a six dimensional system so three

1716
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,640
of one lorenzo tractor three of the

1717
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,040
other and crucially we're coupling them

1718
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,160
together

1719
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,680
through

1720
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,680
um the first

1721
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,400
and fourth state so the the fourth state

1722
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,640
of the system is really like the first

1723
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,040
state of the second lorenz attractor if

1724
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,040
that makes sense

1725
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,720
so basically we're saying that

1726
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,440
uh x1 the first state of one lorenz

1727
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
attractor is talking to x4 which is the

1728
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,920
first state of a second lorenz attractor

1729
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,599
and so just by coupling with them with

1730
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,520
this one state we're mediating kind of

1731
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,359
the flow of information between these

1732
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,200
two lorenz attractors

1733
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,520
and now um

1734
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,040
the next move is to go back to the

1735
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,040
laplace approximation where we're

1736
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,359
enforcing the surprisal function to be

1737
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,839
quadratic a quadratic potential and now

1738
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,359
we're applying it to this six

1739
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,480
dimensional

1740
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,720
um stochastic lorenz system so now we

1741
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,720
are fitting this whole coupled system

1742
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,000
with a 6d multivariate gaussian

1743
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,839
and because of that gaussian constraint

1744
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,599
we'll be able to read off the

1745
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,440
synchronization map from the entries of

1746
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,119
the hessian the inverse covariance

1747
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,200
matrix so on the right what we have are

1748
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,280
just example trajectories

1749
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,799
from the coupled

1750
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,839
lorenz systems

1751
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,760
so this is what carl would call evidence

1752
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,640
of a synchronization manifold in a in a

1753
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,640
more in a less rigorous sense although

1754
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,000
we'll get rigorous with it later but in

1755
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,680
a more anecdotal sense you can see that

1756
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,839
the systems are basically synchronized

1757
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,280
with each other even they're only

1758
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,119
connecting through one state they're

1759
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,520
kind of surfing along similar sub

1760
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,280
manifolds of their state space they're

1761
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,119
kind of hugging each other

1762
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,119
and um

1763
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,720
again these other metrics like the very

1764
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,559
bottom is just to show that the

1765
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,799
approximated flow using this laplace

1766
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,400
approximation plus

1767
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,480
polynomial expansions is

1768
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,400
qualitatively at least positively

1769
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,720
correlated with the true flows of the

1770
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,400
full nonlinear system that has no

1771
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,880
gaussian approximation

1772
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,960
and then the bayesian mechanics

1773
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,720
interpretation comes in next where now

1774
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,520
we again read off the markov blanket

1775
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,640
uh

1776
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,520
uh between that exists between two of

1777
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,559
the lorenz attractors so here the upper

1778
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,240
right is what i'm focusing on now here

1779
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,280
the up the second two states state two

1780
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,680
and state three are the internal states

1781
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,160
of one lorenz attractor whereas states

1782
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,799
five and six that dark blue box are the

1783
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,319
internal states of the second lorenz

1784
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,839
attractor

1785
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,760
and they both share a pair of blanket

1786
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,200
states which are x1 and x4

1787
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,359
so the synchronization map is a map that

1788
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,880
maps from

1789
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,400
x2 and x3 to x5 and x6

1790
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,760
where the mapping is done on the

1791
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,520
conditional densities where the

1792
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,200
conditioning is done on the sensory

1793
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,920
state of either the first system or the

1794
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,920
second system which is

1795
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,839
respectively the active state of the

1796
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,280
other so that's a little bit confusing

1797
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,400
is basically the purple um sensory state

1798
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,920
of the first system is actually the

1799
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
active state of the second system and

1800
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,280
vice versa

1801
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,400
but the the

1802
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,160
most bottom plot is basically showing

1803
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,480
that at any given time

1804
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,720
the internal states of one system are

1805
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,799
making a best guess or a conditional

1806
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,520
estimate about the external state which

1807
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,280
are the internal states of the second

1808
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,200
lorenz attractor so you basically have

1809
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,559
two minds

1810
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,640
little two-dimensional minds that are

1811
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,799
making inferences about each other but

1812
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,640
the inferences are done with respect to

1813
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,079
these conditional densities where the

1814
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,680
conditioning is done on the sensory

1815
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,720
states

1816
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,559
that's basically what all this all these

1817
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,599
plots on the lower right are showing

1818
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,440
um so that's that's the demonstration of

1819
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,119
this inferential or sentience

1820
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,599
interpretation

1821
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,880
and then because as we said the uh the

1822
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,039
full system is multivariate gaussian it

1823
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,640
means all the conditional densities are

1824
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,799
also gaussian and then you can literally

1825
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,200
write down the

1826
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,440
synchronization map as a linear function

1827
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,920
of the states where that linear function

1828
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,280
is given by appropriate sub matrices of

1829
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,200
the full hessian which is the inverse

1830
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,280
covariance and again because we're

1831
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,280
fitting the

1832
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,359
potential function using a polynomial

1833
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,599
expansion it means that the hessian

1834
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,920
function which is the double derivative

1835
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,240
of the probability density with respect

1836
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,079
to the states that will also be a

1837
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,240
function of those polynomial

1838
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,400
coefficients so the end result of all

1839
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,440
that is basically that given this

1840
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
polynomially approximated helmholtz

1841
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,839
decomposition i can then write down the

1842
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,480
synchronization map precisely in terms

1843
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,520
of those coefficients that i fit

1844
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,960
and then you can compute all these nice

1845
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,119
things like a free energy function which

1846
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,599
is basically a sum of accuracy or like

1847
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,520
prediction errors and complexity which

1848
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,359
is effectively a

1849
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,640
prior penalty that penalizes how far the

1850
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,760
uh

1851
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,000
inferred expected state is from its

1852
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
expectation under the full

1853
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,079
um steady state density

1854
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,680
so this is a nice

1855
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,079
um this is a crucial result because it's

1856
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,680
saying even if you don't know what the

1857
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,920
true steady state of a system is you can

1858
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,559
use polynomial expansions and a laplace

1859
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,640
approximation to get something that

1860
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,440
still has rich nonlinear dynamics but by

1861
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,680
enforcing this gaussian constraint on it

1862
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,720
you can then write down the

1863
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,960
synchronization map using linear

1864
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,039
functions and the form of that function

1865
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,400
you know because you fit its

1866
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,839
coefficients

1867
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:59,599
by doing this helmholtz decomposition

1868
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,400
okay so that's basically the main um

1869
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,799
brunt of the uh of the paper

1870
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,720
and ask a few questions so i have one

1871
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,480
question and there's two in the chat so

1872
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,079
the first question is

1873
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,160
in this free energy equation on the

1874
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,200
bottom pi is representing the particular

1875
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,000
states but also we've seen free energy

1876
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,680
minimization on pi representing policy

1877
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,480
where

1878
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,400
free energy minimization is involved in

1879
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,880
the selection of affordances for policy

1880
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,720
selection so what's the relationship

1881
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,039
between free energy minimization of

1882
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,200
particular states like the autonomous

1883
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,680
states and how is that related to free

1884
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,599
energy minimization as

1885
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,680
planning as inference

1886
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,079
yeah that's a great question so

1887
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,319
yeah this has nothing to do with the

1888
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,480
policy one it's just about pi which is

1889
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,720
basically just saying the expected value

1890
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,559
of the particular states which i should

1891
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,720
have mentioned are

1892
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,760
um the autonomous and the blanket states

1893
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,520
so or the autonomous and the sensory

1894
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,760
state so in this case the particular

1895
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,920
states would be the two internal the

1896
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,160
sensory and the active state

1897
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,240
of one of those lorenz attractors where

1898
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,559
its active state is actually the sensory

1899
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,400
state of the other lorenz attractor so

1900
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,240
they share you know they have one

1901
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,880
overlap in terms of their blanket um so

1902
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,760
this here is just saying that on average

1903
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,319
the system is instantaneously minimizing

1904
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,400
at all times this free energy functional

1905
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,839
which is just saying

1906
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,160
is penalizing particular states from how

1907
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,559
far they are from their conditional

1908
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,200
expected value that's the expectation of

1909
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,240
pi given eta where the expectation is

1910
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,480
taken under q um which is this

1911
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,799
variational density that's parameterized

1912
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,799
by the synchronization mapped internal

1913
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,000
states

1914
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,280
um

1915
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,000
the the free the um

1916
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,599
expected free energy which is what

1917
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,000
you're talking about is how do you

1918
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,319
write down a functional of

1919
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,280
trajectories or paths of future

1920
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,680
autonomous states that is minimized such

1921
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,160
that you get the semblance of planning

1922
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,400
behavior where you're penalizing not

1923
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,760
something in terms of how far

1924
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,480
instantaneous is but over a future

1925
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,359
horizon how how much is the free energy

1926
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,520
expected to deviate from the optimal

1927
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,200
policy or path which is going to be a

1928
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,359
sequence of autonomous states

1929
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,479
um that is a more complex question that

1930
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,319
has to basically do with

1931
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,799
yeah free energy basically minimization

1932
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,399
of actions which are

1933
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,158
uh

1934
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,000
under under certain assumptions sums of

1935
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,920
surprisals over time

1936
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,759
um and that's something that is not

1937
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,719
treated at all in this paper but it is

1938
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,439
explicitly treated in an upcoming paper

1939
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,080
um that i believe is in review right now

1940
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
where we explicitly make the connection

1941
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,399
between the instantaneous free energy

1942
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,399
minimization like we see here and then

1943
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,960
this more temporally deep expected free

1944
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,198
energy minimization but basically for

1945
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,399
the present purposes of this paper

1946
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,158
there's no relationship and there and

1947
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,839
nothing can really be said here about

1948
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,920
planning or temporally deep

1949
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,839
uh free energy minimization

1950
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,520
okay let's keep it on this slide and

1951
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,000
i'll ask a few more questions in chat so

1952
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,520
from martin

1953
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,839
is the actual steady state distribution

1954
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,120
of the lorenz attractor known

1955
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,158
um

1956
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,279
no

1957
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,759
basically yeah okay

1958
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,920
um i think there have been other

1959
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,439
there's been other papers where they're

1960
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,640
not using the stochastic lorenz system

1961
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,920
but what they're using is

1962
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,719
uh

1963
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,238
the distributions of a bunch of lorenz

1964
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,080
attractors so this is the difference

1965
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,399
between i guess stochastic differential

1966
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,560
equations and random dynamical systems

1967
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,520
where

1968
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,279
i'm randomizing a bunch of initial

1969
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,279
conditions and then i'm looking at the

1970
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,679
resulting densities of the deterministic

1971
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,359
systems after

1972
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,120
a bunch of time has passed so that's a

1973
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,719
different kind of density it's a density

1974
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,679
over the deterministic ending states or

1975
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,760
deterministic trajectories of the system

1976
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,840
from a bunch of initial conditions and i

1977
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
think there has been work done on

1978
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,159
characterizing those densities but again

1979
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,159
i doubt that those densities are

1980
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,920
parametrically defined i bet they're

1981
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,679
more like approximations like what we

1982
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,760
did here but this is something that

1983
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,520
honestly i'm not an expert on the lorenz

1984
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,280
attractor so that's something that

1985
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,800
i should probably just defer that i

1986
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,320
don't i don't know much about it but i'm

1987
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,760
pretty sure the stochastic lens

1988
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,760
attractor doesn't have a neat solution

1989
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,600
to the plank equation which is what you

1990
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,000
would need to do to get the stationary

1991
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,040
density

1992
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,400
all right i'm going to ask a pair of

1993
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,120
questions from martin and from miguel so

1994
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,520
it's awesome thanks both and everybody

1995
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,120
in the chat because it's

1996
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,560
cool to have this kind of real-time

1997
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,640
field feedback so

1998
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,560
the first question is from martin

1999
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,320
in what way does the markov blanket

2000
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,480
emerge here

2001
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,239
is it not here at some point and then

2002
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,560
later it is so the first question for

2003
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,600
martin is what do you mean by emergence

2004
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,880
and then the second

2005
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,800
question by miguel is

2006
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,320
it is impressive that you can find a

2007
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,199
markov blanket in a non-linear system

2008
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,440
have you quantified how precise are the

2009
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,600
approximations of the covariance and

2010
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,840
hessian values each comparing against

2011
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,880
numerical simulations so question one

2012
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,320
in what way does the markov blanket

2013
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,440
emerge question two how precise are the

2014
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,040
approximation of the covariance and

2015
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,440
hessian

2016
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,159
yeah okay so that's a good question um

2017
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,560
first question about the emergence

2018
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,880
the mark huff blankets

2019
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,320
is defined with respect to the

2020
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,080
stationary density

2021
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,600
the the conditional independence

2022
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,239
relationships expressed in those two

2023
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,440
upper right

2024
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,840
panels log covariance and log hessian so

2025
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,199
those things

2026
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,280
do temporally vary

2027
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,120
in the sense that if you condition on

2028
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,719
some initial state

2029
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,360
the time varying densities

2030
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,599
will

2031
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,239
will have different log covariance and

2032
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,640
log hessian matrices this idea of

2033
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,560
conditioning on an initial

2034
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,640
state and then looking at the time

2035
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,360
evolving densities that's exactly the

2036
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,760
whole point of this paper by thomas and

2037
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,920
a few other of us called memory and

2038
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,520
markup blankets where

2039
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,600
the markov blanket

2040
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,440
can change in the sense that if you look

2041
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,880
at the evolution of conditional

2042
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,480
densities conditioned on some

2043
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,880
perturbation those conditional densities

2044
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
do change but if we just look at the

2045
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,520
stationary density by definition the

2046
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,360
stationary density doesn't change its

2047
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,600
sufficient statistics over time

2048
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,520
because it isn't defined with respect to

2049
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,760
time you've marginalized out sequences

2050
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,159
of variables so in this sense the markov

2051
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,120
blanket

2052
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,800
if you don't condition on a on a

2053
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,480
particular state and you're un you're

2054
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,840
just looking at the unconditional

2055
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,920
stationary density then it's just always

2056
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,000
there it doesn't emerge and maybe i said

2057
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,120
emerge

2058
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,640
and i didn't mean that in a temporal

2059
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,320
sense so there's no sense in which the

2060
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,120
markov blanket emerges markup blanket is

2061
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,800
just a property of the stationary

2062
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,920
covariance matrix or more specifically

2063
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,679
its inverse and that is a constant

2064
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,400
value that is just a characteristic of

2065
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,800
the full six dimensional multivariate

2066
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,840
gaussian

2067
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,199
so even if we didn't even think about

2068
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,040
stochastic processes if i just wrote

2069
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,840
down

2070
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
a six dimensional multivariate gaussian

2071
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,440
with these particular entries of the

2072
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,000
covariance matrix that is the constant

2073
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,600
markup blanket that just always exists

2074
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,560
um

2075
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,679
the

2076
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,000
second question was about

2077
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,840
the precision of the covariance and

2078
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,600
hessian

2079
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,199
numerical simulations

2080
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,640
that's a really good question and i'm

2081
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,400
assuming was that from one of the

2082
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,800
comments that was from miguel yes from

2083
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,640
about yes so i'm assuming you mean um

2084
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,280
the overlap between

2085
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,760
the the um

2086
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,199
cover the empirically measured

2087
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,600
covariance in the laplace

2088
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,520
sorry in the real stochastic lorenz

2089
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,159
system and that one measured um or in

2090
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,000
that one estimated

2091
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,440
in the

2092
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,960
um

2093
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,719
in like so the one estimated from the

2094
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,280
real system and then the analytic

2095
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,440
hessian from the stick from the

2096
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,600
laplacian rates approximate stochastic

2097
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,840
lorenz so i have

2098
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,159
i have the paper up here that i can show

2099
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,520
this that's a really good question so

2100
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,679
one of the reviewers actually asked us

2101
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,840
something very similar and we have an

2102
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,080
extra figure

2103
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,800
that demonstrates exactly that

2104
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,560
can you still see my screen yep looks

2105
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,120
good okay perfect so

2106
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,960
here we're essentially doing exactly

2107
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,880
that um comparison where we're looking

2108
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,840
at the partial correlation which in the

2109
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,679
case of gaussians is actually the same

2110
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,679
thing as the hessian which is an

2111
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,880
interesting

2112
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,320
or sorry it's not the same thing as the

2113
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,400
hessian the partial correlation

2114
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,719
is uh is

2115
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,120
the same is at the same measure of

2116
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,199
conditional independence

2117
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,719
um

2118
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,719
it's not the case for non-gaussians it's

2119
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,719
a case for a few classes of exponential

2120
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,320
distributions that if you measure the

2121
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,920
partial correlation which is a kind of

2122
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,520
conditional correlation between two

2123
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,760
variables it's the same as the the

2124
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,760
corresponding value of the hessian

2125
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,679
so what we're doing here is exactly that

2126
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,159
we're basically measuring how well the

2127
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,880
empirically measured partial correlation

2128
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,800
between different subsets of states so

2129
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,320
here the third and the sixth states

2130
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,440
which should be

2131
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,480
these are the two internal states of two

2132
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,719
mini lorenz attractors within the full

2133
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,040
system so this is like internal state of

2134
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,520
brain one internal state of brain two

2135
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,440
how their partial correlation actually

2136
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,480
measures up with the true hessian value

2137
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,239
and it kind of converges to about very

2138
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,320
close to zero which agrees with the

2139
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,840
analytically

2140
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,080
measured hessian so you can basically

2141
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,760
quantify this more coarsely by just

2142
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,840
looking at the structure of the hessian

2143
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
matches the empirically measured partial

2144
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,080
correlation and the partial correlation

2145
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,320
was basically measured for increasing

2146
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,320
segments of time so the partial

2147
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,760
correlation measured here was from the

2148
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,640
first 50 time steps and then up to years

2149
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,800
the cumulative partial correlation from

2150
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,760
the first until the 500th time step and

2151
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,840
so on so basically by looking at the

2152
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
partial correlation in increasingly long

2153
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,000
windows of time it should converge to

2154
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,760
the true value of the conditional

2155
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,920
independence and

2156
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,800
um it approximates that which we get

2157
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,520
from the laplace approximated system

2158
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,280
what i should say however is that this

2159
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,000
partial correlation was not measured

2160
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,600
from the full

2161
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,679
um lorenz attractor the stochastic one

2162
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,480
but actually just from our approximation

2163
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,920
so we're just saying that if we make

2164
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,000
this approximation and then empirically

2165
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,320
measure the partial correlation from

2166
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,920
real

2167
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,880
um from realizations of that approximate

2168
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,000
system

2169
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
the the empirical measurements line up

2170
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,080
with what it should be given the way

2171
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,000
that we parameterize the flow using the

2172
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,840
polynomial expansion

2173
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,800
um

2174
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,040
however what we haven't done but i think

2175
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,719
would be very interesting and maybe this

2176
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,440
is what was being asked in the question

2177
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,199
is actually to measure this from the

2178
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,520
real stochastic lorenz system to see if

2179
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,000
there actually is a markov blanket

2180
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,040
in the

2181
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,760
um real in in the real around system the

2182
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,440
only issue with that is we can't

2183
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,360
necessarily use partial correlation if

2184
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,199
we did it in the real stochastic lorenz

2185
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,120
system because as we were just

2186
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,040
discussing like martin asked

2187
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,280
do we know what the stationary density

2188
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,800
of the real lorenz system is the

2189
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,960
stochastic one if we don't know that we

2190
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,800
would have to use a less parametric

2191
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,120
method like mutual information

2192
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,360
conditional mutual information in order

2193
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,679
to assess the presence or absence of

2194
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,600
conditional independence so it would be

2195
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,760
harder to do just because evaluating

2196
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,800
massive

2197
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,320
conditional information mutual

2198
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,760
information for increasing amounts of

2199
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,760
time is computationally difficult but i

2200
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,000
agree that that is something that should

2201
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,120
um be done but no we didn't do do it for

2202
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,280
the real stochastic lens we just did it

2203
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,360
between our approximation and our

2204
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,280
analytic hessian

2205
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,719
i hope that answers the question and

2206
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,400
that was clear i can

2207
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,280
we can

2208
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,120
keep talking if there's

2209
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,199
any lack of clarity on that

2210
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,120
i think continue with the presentation

2211
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,880
and if anyone has more questions at the

2212
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,480
end of the presentation we'll return to

2213
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,480
them okay cool

2214
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,320
yeah but that was a very um a good point

2215
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,000
is actually measuring the markov blanket

2216
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,840
like empirically

2217
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,960
okay so the i'm almost done with the the

2218
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,120
overview of the paper so the last big

2219
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,440
thing that's kind of tucked into the one

2220
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,800
of the results section is something

2221
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
called the sparse coupling conjecture

2222
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,480
which is important because it

2223
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,880
dissociates conditional independence

2224
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
from causality so conditional

2225
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,719
independence as we said in the context

2226
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,640
of a gaussian

2227
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,400
actually no it's not even for gaussian

2228
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,640
systems for all systems

2229
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,719
conditional independence is determined

2230
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,920
by

2231
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,719
a zero entry in the hessian so if the

2232
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,120
hessian between two states is zero which

2233
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,679
means the conditional densities don't

2234
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,360
change as you change

2235
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,880
like the conditional density over one

2236
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,480
variable doesn't change as a function of

2237
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,760
the other

2238
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,360
then

2239
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,199
it implies this relationship which is

2240
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,960
shown in terms of the jacobian on the

2241
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,679
left the jacobian basically measures

2242
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,080
causal coupling we we can go into what

2243
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,159
it means mathematically but you can just

2244
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,400
think of the jacobi the jacobian is the

2245
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,159
derivative of the flow function with

2246
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,400
respect to the states and the g and

2247
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,320
entries in the jacobian that are

2248
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,960
non-zero mean that one state is

2249
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,800
influencing another so what this

2250
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,960
relationship shows is that

2251
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,600
if at most one state influences the

2252
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,760
other but not otherwise

2253
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,000
like there's a non-reciprocal coupling

2254
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,159
between one state and the other then the

2255
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,159
two states are conditionally

2256
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,320
um independent i.e there's a markov

2257
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,719
blanket that's a really weird

2258
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,560
counterintuitive statement it means that

2259
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,440
if i'm affecting you but you're not

2260
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,440
affecting me then we will be

2261
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,360
conditionally independent in the steady

2262
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,320
state

2263
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,679
and this is what's called the sparse

2264
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,400
coupling conjecture and it's the way we

2265
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,400
originally wrote it it was actually much

2266
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,520
stronger

2267
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,440
of a claim and then we realized there's

2268
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,040
actually some conditions on it so it's

2269
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,320
called a conjecture because it doesn't

2270
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,239
always hold but there's certain

2271
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,239
conditions under which it should hold

2272
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,840
given a high dimensional enough and

2273
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,640
non-linear enough system

2274
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,159
um so we can kind of prove that more

2275
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,640
mathematically by saying if you expand

2276
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,719
the jacobian by basically taking the

2277
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,920
derivative of the helmholtz

2278
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,000
decomposition so that's what's shown in

2279
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,199
the middle thing

2280
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,960
and then you um

2281
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,120
assume that certain z entries of the

2282
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,679
jacobian are zero

2283
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,199
then you can basically show that it

2284
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,360
implies or sorry not certain entries of

2285
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,960
the jacobian but certain products of

2286
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,560
entries in the jacobian are zero that it

2287
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,960
implies that there's an accompanying

2288
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,120
zero entry in the hessian which is shown

2289
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,320
on the bottom

2290
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,000
so what's shown on the bottom more

2291
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,840
specifically is what's known as the

2292
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,760
normal form of the flow or kind of a

2293
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,840
circular coupling where if you have this

2294
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,159
particular structure of the flow

2295
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,280
operator where certain um block or

2296
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,040
certain sub matrices of the flow

2297
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,840
operator are zero then you're guaranteed

2298
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,560
to have this kind of sparse coupling um

2299
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,480
which means that one state can influence

2300
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,120
the other and not vice versa and then

2301
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,199
you'll get conditional independence in

2302
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,880
the steady state so that's another big

2303
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,800
result that um

2304
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,719
i think during the earlier live stream

2305
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,199
when we talked with lance he had an

2306
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,960
example in his paper where that was also

2307
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,040
the case where basically two systems

2308
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,760
were uh two one state was affecting the

2309
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,040
other but they're actually conditionally

2310
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,239
independent

2311
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,560
um that's that's a uh basically we

2312
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,320
rigorously showed the conditions under

2313
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,400
which that exists here so just because

2314
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,560
you see a zero in the hessian that means

2315
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,639
don't assume that the systems can't

2316
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,639
affect each other two systems are

2317
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,159
conditionally independent doesn't

2318
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,600
necessarily mean that they don't affect

2319
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,800
each other through

2320
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,280
having a non-zero entry in the jacobian

2321
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,639
but it just means that those connections

2322
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,760
have to be asymmetric or non-reciprocal

2323
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,600
so this is an example

2324
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,040
physically of what that would look like

2325
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,800
say we had some system

2326
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,239
with external sensory and active states

2327
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,239
under the normal form of the flow with

2328
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,000
which is this special block diagonal

2329
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
flow operator what this essentially

2330
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,320
means is that you can get this sparse

2331
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,360
coupling conjecture

2332
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,280
his sparse coupling conjecture holds as

2333
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,600
long as sensory states do not affect

2334
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,040
internal states

2335
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,679
and active states

2336
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,080
do not affect external states directly

2337
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,440
but only through

2338
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,239
the

2339
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,560
sensory states so that's a particular

2340
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,560
instantiation of the normal form of the

2341
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,239
flow where you have these

2342
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,719
basically particular entries of the

2343
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,800
jacobian and the solenoidal flow

2344
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,800
operator are zero and then you'll get

2345
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,600
this

2346
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,719
this kind of

2347
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,880
sparse coupling or

2348
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,600
circular coupling

2349
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,120
one question on that

2350
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,719
and then dean if you'd like to ask any

2351
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,800
questions and this is also related to

2352
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,280
the work of miguel the paper that was

2353
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,960
brought up earlier

2354
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,159
what is the topology of perception

2355
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,280
cognition and action is it just

2356
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,520
sense influencing internal and internal

2357
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,199
influencing active and active

2358
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,120
influencing external which then feedback

2359
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,760
to sensory sort of the simple clock

2360
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,719
model

2361
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,760
or here we have a edge between sense and

2362
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,120
active states the blanket states and so

2363
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,280
in free energy principle and active

2364
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,760
inference are we committed to a certain

2365
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,320
topology of action

2366
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,880
um that's a really good question yeah so

2367
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,719
given the sparse coupling conjecture and

2368
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,880
the normal form of the flow

2369
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,239
all

2370
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,840
all this is so basically no we're not

2371
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,199
committed to anything there's so many

2372
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,719
different combinations that will give

2373
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,000
rise to

2374
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,080
a conditional synchronization manifold

2375
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,760
that can be interpreted as bayesian

2376
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,120
mechanics

2377
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,120
what all we're saying is that

2378
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,520
this coupling structure we have here is

2379
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,920
mainly defined by the lack of certain

2380
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,120
connections

2381
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,760
so all that we're saying is if external

2382
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,560
states do not affect active states

2383
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,239
and sensory states

2384
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,480
or sorry internal states do not directly

2385
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,480
affect sensory states so it's the lack

2386
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,040
of those two connections can you see my

2387
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,400
mouse actually

2388
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,600
uh yes

2389
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,199
yes so if you don't have a connection

2390
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,000
going from blue to red

2391
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,600
and you don't have one going from

2392
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,920
blue to sensory

2393
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,360
but anything else is is is allowed like

2394
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,880
all i'm saying is putting constraints on

2395
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,800
what cannot exist

2396
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,239
then the conditions laid out here

2397
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,440
will hold

2398
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,840
and the sparse coupling conjecture

2399
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,360
um will exist which means that an

2400
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,679
asymmetric relationship implies

2401
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,920
conditional independence so given that

2402
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,560
what it means is that actually

2403
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,280
sensory states will be conditionally

2404
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,000
independent of uh of internal states

2405
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
conditioned on active states because

2406
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,880
there's only a unidirectional coupling

2407
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,159
so those are some weird um

2408
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,760
weird like results from this is that

2409
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,040
sensory and internal will be

2410
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,880
conditionally independent because one

2411
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,960
affects the other but the other does not

2412
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,360
affect the first one and likewise for

2413
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,679
active and uh and

2414
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,760
external states but all that being aside

2415
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,560
external and and internal will still be

2416
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,920
conditionally independent and therefore

2417
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,159
there'll still be a synchronization map

2418
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,320
between them so

2419
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,080
these the conditions about the topology

2420
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,440
that i laid out the absence of these

2421
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,280
connections just have to do with

2422
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,199
satisfying the normal form of the flow

2423
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,199
as laid out here and satisfying this

2424
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,040
weird sparse coupling conjecture about

2425
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,679
unidirectional non-reciprocal coupling

2426
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,520
but other than that the active inference

2427
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,679
story and the bayesian mechanics story

2428
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,080
you can swap around all these

2429
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,159
influences and it'll still pertain as

2430
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,080
long as this guy is conditionally

2431
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,840
independent of this one

2432
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,040
so if these two are conditionally

2433
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,480
independent

2434
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,280
um

2435
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,880
dependent on the blanket states then

2436
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,800
that synchronization map still exists

2437
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,159
but you can have all kinds of weird

2438
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,239
coupling loops between the between the

2439
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,280
two

2440
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,719
thanks very

2441
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,239
interesting

2442
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:48,559
dean you want to ask anything here or

2443
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,480
well there's so many things i could ask

2444
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,760
and i probably and and i'd get a great

2445
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,760
answer back and and i'd only be able to

2446
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,000
use a small percentage of the great

2447
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,199
answer one thing i i do want to i i will

2448
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,920
ask this and i'm not sure if it's

2449
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,320
if it's good or not but i i've been

2450
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,920
doing a lot of work and trying to see

2451
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,480
whether or not the active sensory state

2452
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,760
is a form of kind of decomposition of

2453
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,960
where a concept might rest between

2454
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,800
things like content

2455
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,639
and context

2456
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,280
and i'm just wondering when you when you

2457
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,760
do this math and you get a sense

2458
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,639
of

2459
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,120
knowing what you're working with

2460
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,440
and the relationship between all of the

2461
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,360
different components of what you're

2462
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,040
working with

2463
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,560
do you see

2464
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,280
in in this a lot instead of things

2465
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,120
always assuming that things just sort of

2466
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,040
pop out as an emergency as an emergence

2467
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,159
do you do you start getting a sense that

2468
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,040
sometimes things just exist within and

2469
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,280
between and those constraints and

2470
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,639
some of the things you talked in terms

2471
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,560
of linearity and just getting an

2472
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,639
understanding of what you're working

2473
01:26:58,639 --> 01:26:59,440
with

2474
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,639
do you see

2475
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,120
things like concepts

2476
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,520
sort of resting in between

2477
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,400
these

2478
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,080
these other areas we call them in this

2479
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,040
diagram external and internal states but

2480
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,679
would a concept be that

2481
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,159
sort of fluid and appearing and

2482
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,040
disappearing based on some of the things

2483
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,520
that you've looked at here in this paper

2484
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,840
yeah i definitely think so i mean for me

2485
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,760
when i start thinking about concepts i

2486
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,159
immediately start thinking about

2487
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,760
relationships right like what we've

2488
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,520
shown here a very low dimensional

2489
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,960
systems where you have a few internal a

2490
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,520
few active a few sensory

2491
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,520
a few external once you start having

2492
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,719
larger

2493
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,960
higher dimensional systems so say we

2494
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,920
weren't modeling a lorenz a two s like

2495
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,920
kind of dumb lorenz attractors just

2496
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,840
oscillating around each other but say we

2497
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,120
had some 100 dimensional neural network

2498
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,639
synchronized with another 100

2499
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,400
dimensional external state space like

2500
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,639
another neural network once you're

2501
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,320
getting into that world

2502
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,800
i think you get the you can have the

2503
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,040
computational representational capacity

2504
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,800
for things like concepts because you

2505
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,880
just have a higher correlational

2506
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,440
structure so imagine that we had a

2507
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,280
hundred internal states

2508
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,120
the internal states we know in some way

2509
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,360
are relating to the external states but

2510
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,199
they're also relating to each other so

2511
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,920
there might be like sub groups like

2512
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,080
groups of 10 or 20 neurons that are all

2513
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,080
correlated and they're firing to each

2514
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,159
other there might be rich recurrent

2515
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:32,159
internal dynamics just within the

2516
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,400
internal states and the particular

2517
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,960
relationship of sub manifolds so to

2518
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,199
speak of the internal state space how

2519
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,199
those conditionally relate to external

2520
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,040
states that's where i think you start

2521
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,639
getting into the world of concepts where

2522
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,520
you can have

2523
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,679
under a certain part of the external

2524
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,080
state space this part of the internal

2525
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,239
manifold gets more or less activated

2526
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,760
versus when that part of the external

2527
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,360
state space lights up

2528
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,719
this different part of the internal

2529
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,719
state space gets lit up so i think the

2530
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:01,280
key to identifying some of the concepts

2531
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,800
really relies on having higher

2532
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,960
dimensional systems which then allow you

2533
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,840
to have kind of more rich

2534
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
lower dimensional correlation structure

2535
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,679
that kind of exists in the ambient

2536
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,760
dimension of like 100 dimensional state

2537
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,719
space

2538
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,880
that that would be that's how i at least

2539
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,800
interpret your description of like the

2540
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,960
concepts kind of existing in between it

2541
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,480
really rests in

2542
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,400
lower dimensional manifolds of ambient

2543
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,360
high dimensionality

2544
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,239
um

2545
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:35,280
so yeah that's like we're pretty much

2546
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,800
done with the thing that this is just a

2547
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,960
summary of the contributions

2548
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,480
um

2549
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,239
i would say like yeah it humbles

2550
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,719
decomposition fitting it to a stochastic

2551
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,719
dynamical system where we don't know the

2552
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,719
steady state distribution

2553
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,239
and then going through the steps with

2554
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,719
this laplace approximated one

2555
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,440
studying its synchronization manifold

2556
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,199
doing this cool like coupled lorenz

2557
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,719
thing and then finally this sparse

2558
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,560
coupling conjecture about circular

2559
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,760
coupling

2560
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,800
um

2561
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,480
and yeah you can move to the discussion

2562
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,480
now or go back dive into the slides or

2563
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,840
dive into different parts of the paper

2564
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,679
that i didn't even talk about here

2565
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:11,440
um whatever you guys think

2566
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,719
best

2567
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:13,679
great

2568
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,560
maybe you could unshare and we'll have

2569
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,880
some time just to

2570
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,000
talk and see um if anyone else has any

2571
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,639
questions in the chat so just one

2572
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,040
starting question from martin was

2573
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,360
the question above was whether it is

2574
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,679
even known that the lorenz attractor has

2575
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,239
a stationary state

2576
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,600
did we address that earlier oh sorry

2577
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,320
yeah we we addressed it like my initial

2578
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,800
answer that was i'm pretty sure it's not

2579
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,760
known

2580
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,920
but i'm not positive like i'm not an

2581
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,120
expert on the stochastic level

2582
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,480
instructor but i'm pretty sure it's not

2583
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,360
known

2584
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,400
because i just

2585
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,960
imagine intuitively that writing down a

2586
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,560
unique solution to the focker plank

2587
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,639
operator would be very difficult for

2588
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,480
that which i imagine is difficult for

2589
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,560
any system that exhibits stochastic

2590
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,159
chaos

2591
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,040
okay and another question from martin is

2592
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,760
whether the sparse coupling conjecture

2593
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,000
requires a gaussian as the stationary

2594
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,320
distribution

2595
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,040
um no it doesn't

2596
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,639
um

2597
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,800
the requirements on it are not about the

2598
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,120
gaussianity of the density

2599
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,199
they're more actually

2600
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:23,920
so

2601
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,880
for this new paper that's in review now

2602
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,880
there's an appendix in that paper that

2603
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,360
um more that fleshes out the conditions

2604
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,320
on the sparse coupling conjecture more

2605
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,239
um rigorously

2606
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,560
and the conditions are not about the the

2607
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,480
get the

2608
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,639
form of the stationary density um

2609
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,520
they're actually more about basically

2610
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,560
how

2611
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,639
local the coupling is in the solenoidal

2612
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,159
term so if the solenoidal terms are

2613
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:53,040
state-dependent like solenoidal term ij

2614
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,800
depends on the states

2615
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,639
then the sparse coupling conjecture only

2616
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,040
holds if that dependence is only a

2617
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,440
function of states i and j but if the

2618
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,600
coupling between states i and j

2619
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,280
is actually a state dependent function

2620
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,040
of state k

2621
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,440
then the sparse coupling conjecture can

2622
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,360
be more easily violated

2623
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,239
um and i have a proof of that that i can

2624
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,000
again share my screen and show you but

2625
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,199
it's not really related to your question

2626
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,040
which was more about is the gaussianity

2627
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,679
related to the sparse coupling so yeah

2628
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,520
it's not what you described there

2629
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,920
reminds me a lot of neuro modulation and

2630
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,360
about how like the effective

2631
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,960
connectivity of two regions could be

2632
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,199
modulated so

2633
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,679
here's a question from miguel and then

2634
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,360
we can go to dean and then i have a

2635
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,239
question as well so from miguel in

2636
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,480
non-linear systems high order

2637
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,560
correlations might arise

2638
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,639
i think this means the hessian may not

2639
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,400
be enough to assess conditional

2640
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,800
independence do you see a way to explore

2641
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,080
that with this method

2642
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,239
um

2643
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,480
my

2644
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:02,800
yeah that's a great question so my

2645
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,239
intuition

2646
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,480
is that if you use this method that we

2647
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,719
talked about in the second part

2648
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,159
um

2649
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,760
where it's like higher order density

2650
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,440
learning

2651
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,800
if you

2652
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,560
are basically basically the high order

2653
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,679
density learning where you're not

2654
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,760
assuming a laplace approximation but

2655
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,440
you're enforcing a

2656
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,199
state space local

2657
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,280
quadratic approximation

2658
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,440
to the potential function

2659
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,800
that means that you have a hessian

2660
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,360
that's changing over state space

2661
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,199
what your point is basically saying is

2662
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:34,239
that because of higher order

2663
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:36,159
correlations there will probably be

2664
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,800
parts of state space even if for like

2665
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,400
three quarters of space space the

2666
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
hessian is zero there's a final quarter

2667
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,000
where the hessian will not be zero in

2668
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,600
that part of state space

2669
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,199
and i think what that allows you to do

2670
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,040
is basically say

2671
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,480
that insofar as the hessian does locally

2672
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,400
approximate the markov blanket between

2673
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,120
two states it means that there's

2674
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,199
regions of state space where the markov

2675
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,600
blanket condition applies and then other

2676
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,199
regions where it doesn't and the markup

2677
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,040
blanket disappears

2678
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,000
the claims in this paper about

2679
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,360
the conditional independence

2680
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,960
relationships especially as they relate

2681
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,760
to sparse coupling only apply

2682
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,600
to hessians that even if they're state

2683
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,280
dependent hessians which implies a

2684
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,600
non-gaussian stationary distribution

2685
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,679
that that entry of the hessian is zero

2686
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,080
for every part in state space

2687
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,120
so i don't know if the sparse coupling

2688
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,280
conjecture for instance applies

2689
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,280
um where there's a state-dependent

2690
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,360
hessian entry that's

2691
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,199
not that zero in some parts of state

2692
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,880
space and non-zero and other parts i

2693
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,320
think that will throw a wrench in this

2694
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,080
formulation potentially

2695
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,560
um but it would be interesting to say if

2696
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,560
if you can still interpret

2697
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,520
the entry of the hessian as being

2698
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,840
a on off signal of there's a markov

2699
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,679
blanket between these two things what

2700
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,280
does it mean if that markup link is

2701
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,719
changing as a function of where you are

2702
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:56,080
in state space does it mean that

2703
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,760
sometimes there's a synchronization map

2704
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,400
between these two states depending if

2705
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,159
they're visiting this region of state

2706
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,320
space versus that or maybe that actually

2707
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,000
doesn't make sense so i don't know i

2708
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,119
think it can certainly be used to

2709
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,880
explore those questions but offhand i

2710
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,560
don't have an easy answer i think that's

2711
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,960
a really good good question

2712
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,719
cool thank you

2713
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,320
dean if you'd like to throw one out

2714
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,639
yeah i'm just curious so we had a we

2715
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,320
were just doing a recent paper and it

2716
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,760
was talking about

2717
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,000
sort of how did you get here how did you

2718
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,320
come to this place and i would like to

2719
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,199
ask

2720
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,560
connor

2721
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,639
when i don't know

2722
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,360
the history of how housekeeping

2723
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,560
uh was introduced to this formalism so i

2724
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,320
was just wondering if maybe you could

2725
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,679
walk us through that i don't think you

2726
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:42,639
sort of

2727
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,880
put a put a notice up on the door and

2728
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,760
called housekeeping it just seemed to

2729
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,840
insert itself so maybe you could tell us

2730
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,080
how that how you know when it was

2731
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,440
introduced

2732
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,840
not assumed right how you kind of dealt

2733
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,040
with that

2734
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,600
yeah yeah it's a a really a good

2735
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,440
question so basically

2736
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,760
well okay yeah it's interesting

2737
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,040
um

2738
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,119
the whole point so from my understanding

2739
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,520
the evolution of this paper

2740
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,280
came into

2741
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,400
um that the beginnings of this paper was

2742
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,199
there was a a meeting that i presented

2743
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,679
at carl's lab meeting in 20

2744
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,920
must have been late 2020

2745
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,840
where i was trying to do this kind of

2746
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,480
bayes mechanical analysis on a very high

2747
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,800
dimensional non-linear system and i was

2748
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,320
trying to model basically schools of

2749
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,800
fish can you look at certain

2750
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,960
groups of a big school of fish and

2751
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,560
interpret their states as if they're

2752
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,840
doing inference about something

2753
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,040
happening on the other side of the

2754
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,920
school

2755
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,760
and so at the end we had a bunch of

2756
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,119
conversations i think we had three

2757
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:44,639
meetings total where we just went

2758
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,320
through the mathematics of how that's

2759
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,440
possible and it drove carl to say okay

2760
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,400
what we're going to do is we're going to

2761
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,239
write down we're going to write a paper

2762
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,400
where we deal with a system like that

2763
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,239
where things are very state dependent

2764
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,560
and non-linear and state space so that

2765
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,320
forced carl basically to go back to the

2766
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,440
drawing board with the helmholtz

2767
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,800
decomposition

2768
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,199
and as a result of all the mathematical

2769
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,280
formulation here which is like 95

2770
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,520
percent just carl like

2771
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,960
writing that down and figuring things

2772
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,679
out he realized that there's this extra

2773
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,080
term this housekeeping term that pops

2774
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,080
out of the helmholtz decomposition

2775
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,800
so my assumption is he named it

2776
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,239
housekeeping term because it was

2777
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:24,320
basically this um

2778
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,800
unintended side effect of trying to do

2779
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,119
the helmholtz decomposition on systems

2780
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,280
that are highly non-linear and so the

2781
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,880
housekeeping term

2782
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,560
came out as like oh i need to have this

2783
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,320
thing to make sure everything's neat and

2784
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,920
in order because if you actually look at

2785
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,520
the mathematical derivation of where

2786
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,000
that term comes from i'm not sure carl

2787
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,840
was familiar with it

2788
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,119
from the literature or if he just

2789
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,639
derived it and kind of thought of it

2790
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,080
himself i'm actually really not sure on

2791
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,360
his own

2792
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,800
intellectual journey to getting there

2793
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,280
but it is in the stochastic processes

2794
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,719
literature it's not like a totally new

2795
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:57,440
thing it's been known for like decades

2796
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,639
now

2797
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,639
but i think from his perspective he

2798
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,639
labeled it housekeeping term because it

2799
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,880
was this new thing that pops out that he

2800
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,920
has to

2801
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,480
account for that keeps the full

2802
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,800
plank solution like in order so you

2803
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,320
basically need to add that on to make

2804
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,480
sure that certain terms don't be

2805
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,719
like remain zero when you're trying to

2806
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:18,560
solve the or punic solution it has

2807
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,159
to do something

2808
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,320
called the probability current to make

2809
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,840
sure the divergence of the probability

2810
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,679
current to zero need to add in this

2811
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,400
housekeeping term so my

2812
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,159
interpretation of the word housekeeping

2813
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:31,840
is very analogous to the word correction

2814
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,360
like it's a correction term or a

2815
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,840
cancellation term

2816
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,960
um but that was a a vocabulary that carl

2817
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,320
just started using in the paper

2818
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,920
awesome dot 4 32.4 it's never too late

2819
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,520
um

2820
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,600
you briefly touched on where i was going

2821
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,280
to go with this next question which was

2822
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,000
about collective behavior so just

2823
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,800
how are you thinking about these kinds

2824
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,119
of formalisms in collective behavioral

2825
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,159
systems

2826
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,960
are we thinking about multi-agent

2827
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,159
simulations of active inference agents

2828
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,840
like we had done with ants or is there

2829
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,840
another level of analysis where the

2830
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,080
collective is sort of this

2831
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,280
shifting

2832
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,040
entity in and of itself like where does

2833
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,199
this apply to collective behavior

2834
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,679
yeah that's a great question so um i i

2835
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,119
can just personally speak to that

2836
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,880
because that's like essentially the

2837
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,639
the

2838
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,560
thing i'm doing during my phd so one

2839
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,880
half of my phd or say one third of my

2840
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,040
phd is doing the first thing which is

2841
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,199
very similar to what you've done with uh

2842
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,159
active inference where i'm just taking a

2843
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,320
bunch of active inference agents and i'm

2844
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,600
making them school together

2845
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,920
i first tried doing that and like that's

2846
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,000
a separate story that like maybe we can

2847
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,280
have another live stream and talk about

2848
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,880
that because that's a cool thing but

2849
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,440
that has nothing to do with writing down

2850
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,280
the stationary density of the entire

2851
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,679
system i tried to do that at first but

2852
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,760
it's very hard because every active

2853
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,000
inference agent is a mixture between

2854
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,040
sdes and odes and all the things we

2855
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,800
talked about today were just sdes

2856
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,960
stochastic systems when whereas when

2857
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,719
you're doing a single active inference

2858
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,880
agent like doing predictive coding

2859
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,520
its neural dynamics are actually solved

2860
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,760
as an ode which is a straight

2861
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,280
deterministic gradient descent on

2862
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,400
variational free energy so in a big

2863
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,000
collective

2864
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,320
dynamical system that has some odes and

2865
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,560
some sdes writing down the stationary

2866
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,639
density becomes very difficult so

2867
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:33,920
because of that we had all these

2868
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,520
meetings and this paper was one of the

2869
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,679
results of those meetings so the the

2870
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,760
approach i'm taking now is i'm not

2871
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,000
modeling individuals as active inference

2872
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,320
agents i'm just modeling each of them as

2873
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,560
like for instance the 2d position of a

2874
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,119
particle that has some velocity and some

2875
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,280
position and then there's classic

2876
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,360
schooling models like the v-check model

2877
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,760
or the reynolds model or the cousin

2878
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,320
model which was um identified by my

2879
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,360
advisor

2880
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,560
where you're basically just trying to

2881
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,520
model

2882
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,440
schooling fish or

2883
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,360
schooling or flocking birds as a bunch

2884
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,920
of little stochastic differential

2885
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,600
equations that are coupled to each other

2886
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,119
so the approach i'm taking now is

2887
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,920
applying exactly the formalism

2888
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,520
described today

2889
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,880
to higher dimensional systems and you

2890
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,800
encounter special challenges when you do

2891
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,480
that because

2892
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,400
um

2893
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,960
the trying to fit a polynomial expansion

2894
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,480
with all the higher order interaction

2895
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,000
terms to like a hundred dimensional

2896
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,920
system it's just not going to be

2897
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,440
feasible if you're including every

2898
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,040
possible interaction it's just like

2899
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,159
you're going to have an ex

2900
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,719
combinatorially explosive state space so

2901
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,400
i'm basically a lot of the work i'm

2902
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,639
doing now is figuring out ways to fit

2903
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,400
the helmholtz decomposition using

2904
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,679
non-polynomial expansion methods that

2905
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:48,639
are more

2906
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:49,440
um

2907
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,159
uh amenable to higher dimensional data

2908
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,360
where you don't have this cursive

2909
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,520
dimensionality and so a lot of that

2910
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,880
involves what you could probably guess

2911
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,960
using amortized approximations like deep

2912
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,360
neural networks to fit the coefficients

2913
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,639
of the helmholtz

2914
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:03,679
um so that's something i'm like

2915
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:04,960
literally working on right now so

2916
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,719
there's not too many results on there

2917
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:08,320
but that's like that's one of the two

2918
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,679
directions i'm going there's the

2919
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,199
multi-agent active inference and then

2920
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,440
there's the high dimensional helmholtz

2921
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,320
decomposition stuff

2922
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,199
cool like i'd imagine that nested

2923
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,119
cognitive systems with shifting

2924
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:23,199
boundaries and functional relationships

2925
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,280
that's challenging for any framework but

2926
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,159
at least

2927
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,880
we're quite rapidly approaching

2928
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,840
the ability to have the grammar and the

2929
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,360
motifs

2930
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,360
to actually talk about those questions

2931
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,520
and then also see them from multiple

2932
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,119
perspectives

2933
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:40,400
either as

2934
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,520
uh cognitive agents interacting in a way

2935
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,600
where we don't even need to have the top

2936
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,400
level be anything specific or more from

2937
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,840
a top-down perspective which as you

2938
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,239
pointed out it's hard to then introduce

2939
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:57,199
the cognitive elements into those

2940
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:58,639
particles

2941
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:00,880
yeah exactly

2942
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,800
yeah i mean just if i could just follow

2943
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,719
up on that i think the ultimate goal

2944
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,719
would be to bridge both right like it

2945
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:09,040
would be sick to write down a big

2946
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,880
multi-agent active inference simulation

2947
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,880
where every single agent is actually

2948
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,960
doing a gradient descent on free energy

2949
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,560
to choose their actions whether they're

2950
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,360
mdps or predictive coding agents but

2951
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,800
then you can also write down a

2952
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
stationary density for the whole thing

2953
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,280
and identify the markov blanket of the

2954
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,880
whole system because then you would

2955
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,719
truly have the multi-scale perspective

2956
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,159
you would have the generative model of

2957
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,000
the individuals and then you would have

2958
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,600
the generative model of the whole

2959
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,679
existing simultaneously and then you

2960
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,679
could really ask questions like if i

2961
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,000
change the sensory precision of this

2962
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
single agent how does that affect the

2963
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,400
actual markov blanket at the collective

2964
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,920
level and that's just so like

2965
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,440
technically difficult that's like

2966
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,600
originally what i planned to do

2967
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,119
but i ended up splitting into two

2968
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:52,239
separate things because just the

2969
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:53,840
mathematics behind it was too hard for

2970
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,639
me but uh yeah that would be really cool

2971
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,719
i i hope this isn't uh misleading

2972
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,560
physical intuition but it's almost like

2973
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,760
if we have a ball rolling on a surface

2974
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,719
there um could be the sort of particles

2975
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,400
within the ball which are

2976
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,480
minimizing a potential function relative

2977
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,639
to their local position and then there's

2978
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:15,280
the ball rolling on the landscape and

2979
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,800
then the housekeeping term is almost

2980
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,280
like the landscape is soft and so it's

2981
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,360
state dependent what the landscape

2982
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,280
actually looks like that's why you can't

2983
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,000
just set it and forget it with the way

2984
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,119
that the

2985
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:30,800
landscape is the flow operator are

2986
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,400
dean if you have a question and then

2987
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,480
martin i have a question from him

2988
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,880
yeah uh so

2989
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,400
on on that

2990
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,679
you

2991
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:40,719
on that

2992
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,800
same theme

2993
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,800
uh i'll i'll give you a sort of a

2994
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,280
metaphorical story so if i'm standing on

2995
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,199
the bunny hill and i'm trying to control

2996
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,480
gravity

2997
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,320
and i'm sliding with all my friends

2998
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,000
we're flocking down here on the bunny

2999
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,480
hill and having a good time and we're

3000
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,199
looking up at the head wall

3001
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,760
and the irony is of course if you've

3002
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,080
been up there mathematically you know

3003
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,560
that you can't control gravity on the

3004
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,480
head wall just because the pitch is

3005
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,480
different now to the person on the bunny

3006
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,440
hill

3007
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,520
what and all of their behavior they're

3008
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,119
all kind of swimming around down here on

3009
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:18,400
the sort of more gradual surface

3010
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,080
conceptually

3011
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,000
they would have to let go of their

3012
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,840
concepts of what they're doing to

3013
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,159
control gravity down here those those

3014
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,679
same themes don't apply on that on that

3015
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:30,880
head wall

3016
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,040
how how do we get our minds wrapped

3017
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,199
around that the letting go of what we

3018
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,400
think

3019
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,960
we would our first intuition

3020
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,480
we we can see the head wall we're not

3021
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,560
even blinded to it our first intuition

3022
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,639
would be well how will i control gravity

3023
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,239
up there when in fact the first thing

3024
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:49,760
you have to do is let go of your current

3025
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,880
concept right so mathematically how

3026
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,159
would we

3027
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,239
how would we show

3028
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:58,960
that the benefit isn't in in in a

3029
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,360
continuation or uh

3030
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,239
a common combinatorial thinking around

3031
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:05,840
that it would actually be a

3032
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,000
reconciliation letting go of what you

3033
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,080
know in order to be able to take up

3034
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,119
something

3035
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,679
new that's the part where

3036
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,280
i'm not sure if your paper answers that

3037
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,080
but at least it leaves enough space open

3038
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,280
that it isn't a lin always a linear

3039
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,960
i'm down here

3040
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,880
i'm gonna i'm gonna make my way up the

3041
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,280
side of that that hill and i'm going to

3042
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,600
be able to apply exactly the same

3043
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,000
thinking to that new situation

3044
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,239
that's the part that i quite fascinating

3045
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,159
i i really appreciate

3046
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,639
the idea of collective behavior but for

3047
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,239
me it's how do i let go of one idea in

3048
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,239
order to be able to take up a new one

3049
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:47,040
that allows me to continue to fep my way

3050
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,080
down the hill um yeah that's really cool

3051
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,119
yeah no i think that's like a critical

3052
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,960
i i would say that's a critical insight

3053
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,960
from all of this is showing that like

3054
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,880
something that seems optimal at your

3055
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,639
local level or whatever the concepts are

3056
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,639
they use at your local level really it's

3057
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,320
a different game when you zoom out or

3058
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
when you look at like a different

3059
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,960
um scale so i think that has a lot to do

3060
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,800
with this idea of what me and daniel

3061
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,400
were just talking about of like

3062
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,320
how do the individuals their their

3063
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,400
language that the terms the state space

3064
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,920
they think in terms of could be a

3065
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,520
totally fundamentally different language

3066
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,280
than the language that the collective

3067
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,880
thinks in terms of which is the same

3068
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,400
thing of like

3069
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,400
me trying to plan now versus playing in

3070
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,480
the future planning now is based on

3071
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,320
making sure like i am sitting up

3072
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,920
straight and i'm drinking enough water

3073
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,199
but playing in the futures what am i

3074
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:34,960
going to do in 10 days and what's

3075
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,880
optimal from those perspectives can be

3076
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,400
like a totally different

3077
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,840
state space like a different language

3078
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,119
essentially

3079
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,960
so the nesting of different time skills

3080
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,280
is important and also it's one reason

3081
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,880
the housekeeping term is important

3082
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,960
because for active systems that can

3083
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,199
undertake epistemic actions

3084
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,760
if action is not recalculated every

3085
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,320
single perception cognitive and action

3086
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:00,080
loop then it's like you're going to be

3087
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,000
navigating based upon

3088
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,800
a mirage or a fantasy

3089
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,520
let me ask this good question from

3090
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,520
martin in the chat

3091
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,600
the construction in this paper of how

3092
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,760
internal states do inference on external

3093
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,159
states is still the same as in a free

3094
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:17,760
energy principle for a particular

3095
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,360
physics or not

3096
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,920
is miguel's criticism of the derivation

3097
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,400
of this in a free energy principle for a

3098
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,320
particular physics taken into account

3099
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,000
here or not

3100
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,199
um

3101
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:32,400
that's a really good question so

3102
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,639
my understanding um

3103
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:36,159
okay so the big thing that changed

3104
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:37,600
between free energy principle for a

3105
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,119
particular physics

3106
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,040
and what was done here as well as what

3107
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,840
was done in lance's paper

3108
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,119
on the biggest

3109
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,520
change and i think i'm not sure miguel

3110
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,440
you if miguel's here he can correct me

3111
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,880
if miguel also made this is we went from

3112
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,600
arg max to expectation so in free energy

3113
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,560
persons

3114
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,360
uh

3115
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,119
free energy principle for a particular

3116
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,440
physics the synchronization manifold was

3117
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,679
defined as a map between the modes of

3118
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,119
two conditional densities i.e the

3119
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:06,800
maximum probability

3120
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,960
point to another max probability point

3121
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:12,000
the big move that um allows us to get

3122
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,560
away with the difference between argamax

3123
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,360
and

3124
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,440
um expectation is that we make

3125
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,880
everything gaussian so that they're the

3126
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,719
same and crucially everything is

3127
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,400
differentiable because gaussians are

3128
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,800
smooth and and the arg max function is

3129
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,480
crucially smooth because the expectation

3130
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,360
is smooth so i don't know

3131
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,199
how you get around

3132
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,840
how you deal with multimodal densities

3133
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,239
um when you're mapping between the modes

3134
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,400
of the two conditional densities because

3135
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,159
the arg max function

3136
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:42,560
may not be differentiable anymore

3137
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,960
and one of the main things that and the

3138
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,040
differentiability of arg max slash

3139
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,360
expectation also

3140
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,199
factors into the differentiability of

3141
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:53,280
the synchronization manifold which needs

3142
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,880
to be differentiable

3143
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,679
by construction so i think one of the

3144
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:00,000
main things that

3145
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,800
miguel was talking about was talking

3146
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,440
about the differentiability of sigma

3147
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,360
but he was also talking about the the

3148
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,760
flow of the internal states and whether

3149
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,320
the flow of the internal states can also

3150
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,760
be thought of as doing flows on

3151
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,199
variational free energy and that paper

3152
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,840
they very very nicely showed that the

3153
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,760
average flow is not the same as the flow

3154
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,599
of the average and therefore it's not

3155
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,199
guaranteed that any

3156
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,119
individual realization will look as if

3157
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,080
it's doing

3158
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,480
inference so the these this this paper

3159
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,320
as well as lance's paper on basic

3160
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,560
mechanics that does not say anything

3161
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,920
basically about

3162
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,920
the the direction of the flow so i don't

3163
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,159
think there's any disagreement there um

3164
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:39,840
in the new paper that's coming out we

3165
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,400
actually do directly have a new

3166
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,800
um result that talks about the flow of

3167
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,040
individual trajectories that will more

3168
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,719
specifically address

3169
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,800
the flow-based argument that miguel was

3170
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,119
making in uh in his paper where we're

3171
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:55,040
actually looking at the flow of an

3172
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,119
individual trajectory of the system

3173
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,679
in terms of gradients of

3174
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:01,840
the surprisal function or gradients of

3175
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
the variational free energy

3176
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,520
and we're doing that from different

3177
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,599
marginals of the steady state density so

3178
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,599
the flow the active states

3179
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:12,000
as a gradient descent on the um

3180
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,280
variational free energy of the

3181
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,520
particular states for instance or the

3182
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,040
blanket states

3183
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:20,800
um but but like so so there's multiple

3184
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,719
things that can be

3185
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,159
answered from your question one has to

3186
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,080
do with the differentiability of sigma

3187
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,679
which relies on the differentiability of

3188
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:30,480
things like arc max versus expectation

3189
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,719
and other things have to do with

3190
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,400
you relying on the differentiability of

3191
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,080
sigma to look at the flow of the um

3192
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,560
most likely internal state given blanket

3193
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,800
states and neither of these papers

3194
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,880
actually have to do with the flow

3195
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,960
argument and whether the average flows

3196
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,320
equal the flow of the average they just

3197
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,040
have to do with on average does the most

3198
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,719
likely internal say given blanket states

3199
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:55,440
parameterize the density and that is is

3200
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,599
the case that's mathematically the case

3201
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:00,080
and it also gets around the arg max

3202
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,199
versus expectation um issue by making

3203
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:05,199
everything doubt soon

3204
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:06,880
um are there other issues is there

3205
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,000
something more specific because there

3206
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,599
are several critiques in miguel's paper

3207
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:11,520
i think that and maybe i didn't get at

3208
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,440
the one that you're talking about

3209
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,239
uh martin i think this is a perfect

3210
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,320
place for either of you to have a last

3211
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,159
word conor though

3212
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:21,920
thanks so much for

3213
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,159
scheduling this for breaking into the

3214
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,400
dot 3 tier

3215
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,920
which was

3216
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,199
unexpected but awesome and we really

3217
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,880
look forward to your future work and

3218
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,760
joining us for future discussions so any

3219
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,119
last comments if you would like to have

3220
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,000
them

3221
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,760
um yeah no thanks so much for having me

3222
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,440
on it's been it's been a real pleasure

3223
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,480
there's been a really stimulating

3224
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,040
conversation it's and it's also thanks

3225
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,599
to miguel and martin who were in the and

3226
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,199
whoever else was watching it just really

3227
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,800
appreciate the comments that was really

3228
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,440
nice and uh and he also just general

3229
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,119
apologies on the part of all the authors

3230
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,400
that they couldn't be here today and

3231
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,560
also for the earlier live streams

3232
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,320
uh on this paper but you did a really

3233
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,800
great job in discussing the paper

3234
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,199
um so yeah it's it's really cool to like

3235
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,040
that we put out the paper and then we

3236
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,639
get this attention and we get this

3237
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,480
chance to like talk about this stuff

3238
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,400
with you so thanks and thanks dean for

3239
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,679
your great questions too it's really

3240
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,280
always fun uh chatting with you on here

3241
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,719
i think you were here at the last one as

3242
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,080
well that i was

3243
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,639
at so yeah yeah it's awesome and just

3244
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:23,920
like wow

3245
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,840
eight hours is not enough to explore and

3246
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,400
there could be so many ways to

3247
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,360
connect what's being said to core terms

3248
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,159
and the active inference ontology and

3249
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:39,040
it's just a great title so thank you

3250
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,040
connor thank you dean and everybody who

3251
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:45,480
is participating live and asynchronously
