00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
right hello and welcome everyone

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
it's april 27 2022 and we're in actin

4
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,840
lab live stream number 42.2

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
welcome to the actinflab we're a

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,680
participatory online lab that is

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
applied active inference you can find us

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
at the links on this slide

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
this is recorded in an archived live

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
stream so please provide feedback so we

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,199
can improve our work

13
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,879
all backgrounds and perspectives are

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,879
welcome and will follow a good video

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
etiquette for live streams

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
check out activeinference.org to learn

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
more about what's happening in the lab

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
all right well

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
here we are in

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
42.2 we're in our third discussion

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
around the paper

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
robot navigation as hierarchical active

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
inference by the authors listed here

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
and

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
this is a discussion where we're going

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
to pick up on a few different threads

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
that were arising in the dot one

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
and have a lot of time to explore some

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,840
of the formalisms and the robotics

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
aspects of the project and take any

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
questions that people are bringing up

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
and just randomly posting in the live

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,079
chat

34
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
so we'll just start with introductions

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
and saying hello and then we'll jump to

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,479
where we were leaving for last time or

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,799
leaving for this time from last time and

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,399
then just see where we go

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
california and i'll pass to blue

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and i will pass it to tim

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
and hi i'm a researcher in games belgium

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,639
and one of the co-authors of the paper

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,559
so feel free to ask me anything

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,280
wow three three researchers

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
walk into a dot too

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
do you have that kind of joke over there

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
tim

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
like

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
okay we'll start with the evolves

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
okay we had a a few different notes down

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,160
so

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
anyone who wants to pick one of these

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
threads up or we can return to some of

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
the formalisms and questions about the

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
robotics but we're just going to pick up

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,040
a thread and start with whoever wants to

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
go first so we mentioned

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
difference

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
different detail and implementation and

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
just like fun stories or things that

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,160
happened in the implementation

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,040
the idea of different types of maps

65
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,360
and where does emergence

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,840
fit into this

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
one thing i could

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
i could elaborate on is

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,599
basically from the last stream i think

70
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
blue brought up

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
the idea of um

72
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
when you enter a hotel room

73
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
everything kind of looks familiar rather

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
you might have never entered that

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
particular hotel room right

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
and

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
the question was how could this arise

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
from from this kind of model

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
because

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
here it's still kind of very

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
tightly coupled to whatever you're

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
observing in that particular environment

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
and it doesn't really seem to scale to

84
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,720
some something else

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,799
which is uh which is correct

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
and so for

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
for this kind of uh understanding i

88
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,480
think you

89
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
you'll need to build a system that goes

90
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
even higher in hierarchy and and higher

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
in abstraction levels

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
and

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
i've been thinking about this kind of um

94
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
emergence slash kind of models that

95
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,759
could give this kind of

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
behavior

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
and i think at some point

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
you'll need to

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
have a model that is completely

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
reasoning in abstract

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
concepts rather than

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
um

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
observations that that you can observe

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
in your sensory

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
streams

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
so

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
i could imagine that you

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
um

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
that you're building a layer on top

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,759
of

111
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,639
this model so here you basically

112
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
go from

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
camera inputs to a

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
graph based representation of your

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,639
environment

116
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
i could imagine that you

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
repeat this for

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
many different kinds of environments

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
which results which yields you a number

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
of

121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
graphs that map to that particular

122
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,280
environment

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
and that at that point you start kind of

124
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
looking for patterns

125
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,199
in this repertoire of graphs that you

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,680
that you visited in the past

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
and you you start

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
figuring out structure in these grouse

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
like

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
bedrooms all have like the beds and

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
maybe a closet whereas kitchens rather

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,600
have a fridge and a

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,479
sink

134
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
and that you kind of see

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
these kind of repeating

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,759
things in certain graphs and that at

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
this level you kind of

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
make

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
a model that

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
classifies kind of each

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
type of environment into such a category

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
which will then

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
inform you or kind of

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
give you a prior on what kind of graph

145
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
to expect in in in a hotel room for

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,759
example

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,800
um

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
so i realized that i'm talking in very

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
vague and abstract ideas here because

150
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
yeah you don't have it yet but yeah i

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
i think that's kind of

152
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
a way how to

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
how it could

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
be done and

155
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,960
i look very much forward to to actually

156
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
head into this research direction as

157
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
well

158
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,720
in particular uh so if we would think

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
about how would would i implement it

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,559
then i would start with

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
first applying the current system on a

162
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
bunch of environments that have like uh

163
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,440
like two different categories for

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,479
example

165
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
um

166
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
so uh

167
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
and then

168
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
kind of learn

169
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
a model on these crop structures

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,039
and

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
in particular these these current

172
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
evolutions and in graph rural nets might

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
might be a an interesting

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
route to take to see can you learn

175
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
representations of

176
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
graphs or part of the graphs

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
and and like build related codes that

178
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,639
that

179
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
generates similar style graphs basically

180
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,400
and then you can kind of

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
navigate to real environments

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
then learn a model that that builds

183
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319
similar graphs and then use that model

184
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
to kind of imagine

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,840
potentially similar

186
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,080
looking environment

187
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
but still this will be so if we would

188
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,280
implement it purely on on this level i

189
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,759
imagine it will still be very much tied

190
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
to um

191
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
to the observation level like you could

192
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
generate potential camera

193
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,759
frames

194
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
that kind of look like it's it's like

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,198
creating a generic model on this um

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,639
the ls un bedrooms data set so you can

197
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
kind of generate novel kind of bedrooms

198
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
but it's still very much tied to

199
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
the pixel level whereas i think to go to

200
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
a more semantic and human level um

201
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,599
reasoning like we do then at some point

202
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
you'll have to start have

203
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
more understanding carving up the

204
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
observation space into different kind of

205
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
objects and have

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,399
um

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
these kind of representations which are

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
totally not in in the current model

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
and

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
yeah

211
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
you'll have you'll need to have some

212
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
understanding at that level before

213
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,279
before you can

214
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
have reasoning like okay i go to a hotel

215
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
room and i expect there to find the tv

216
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
and remote control for tv basically

217
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
but yeah

218
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
yes blue

219
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
thanks that's uh super interesting and

220
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
kind of a good um maybe tie-in to like i

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
was also thinking about

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
different kinds of maps

223
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,959
more than just over some kind of spatial

224
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
scenario and and the the one obvious

225
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
uh idea that comes to mind is like a

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
semantic map over language uh in natural

227
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
language processing and

228
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,800
using this kind of hotel room scenario

229
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,240
as a topic like in the topic of politics

230
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,640
you expect to find right wing left ring

231
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,120
conservative liberal like you expect to

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
find all of these words in the topic of

233
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
politics if you're trying to model a

234
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,399
topic

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
and i just wonder what other if either

236
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
of you guys have ever thought about

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
other kinds of spaces that can be mapped

238
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
over like this like physical space

239
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
semantic space where else can we build

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
maps where we can kind of implement this

241
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
type of navigation

242
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,320
yeah i mean that's

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
that's a very interesting uh question

244
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
and actually i think one of the core

245
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,600
hypotheses that that adam and i are

246
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,880
investigating is basically that

247
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,800
and anything that is related to

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
to our cognition is

249
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
it

250
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
basically stems from building a kind of

251
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
map and then navigating it um

252
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
and how this could um

253
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
be more concrete size for different

254
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
kinds of maps of course this is a huge

255
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
huge effort and you'll need to have like

256
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,279
um

257
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,440
experts on a certain domain in order to

258
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
kind of

259
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
think about is this possible and how

260
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
could it be

261
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,040
um

262
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
and for some topics it's pretty

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
obvious

264
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,880
like like navigation for instance

265
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,160
um

266
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
and um the the semantic modeling that

267
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
you mentioned i think it's also um

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
intuitively you can relate to how how

269
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
you can build a map from this and and

270
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,959
relate related there's also the

271
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,839
the the work from um

272
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
james whittington on the dolman icon bar

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,959
machine

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
that that goes in a similar direction

275
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,600
where he basically

276
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,839
builds a system that's

277
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
also

278
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
true

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,079
navigating a structure tries to

280
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
infer certain relationships and he also

281
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
applies the same model

282
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,959
on different kinds of

283
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,760
tasks so for example one task is

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
uh also navigation but like navigation

285
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,240
in the in a greek world like you can you

286
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
go north east west south and then you

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
expect to be in the same location again

288
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
but you can also he also applies it like

289
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
on family trees like um

290
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
john is the father of um

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
daniel and then daniel is brother of

292
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,240
blue then you could infer uh

293
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
who is a sister or daniel for example uh

294
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
and and

295
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,639
he also maps this in like navigating a

296
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,600
space

297
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
and and learning how how relationships

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
which which are then like actually

299
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,880
taking actions in the map it's like um

300
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
following the the the

301
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
the broader arrow it's like it's taking

302
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
an action uh in in in the physical map

303
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
let's say and then

304
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
you basically have to traverse through

305
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
the family tree only once but then you

306
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
basically know all the relationships and

307
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
you can start navigating and make these

308
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
kind of inferences so this is actually

309
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
pretty pretty cool work and there was

310
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,639
another i think there was another task

311
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,200
uh we also applied it on so

312
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
there are some tasks so it's really

313
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
obvious how to do it there are plenty of

314
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
others where it's not so obvious

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
but

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,279
yeah some somewhere uh adam and i

317
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
basically think yeah

318
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
this is kind of anything should be

319
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
mappable to the system and and this

320
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
could then be like a

321
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,839
universal way of of

322
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,040
how

323
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,959
how did humans come to

324
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,680
uh thinking in in these kind of abstract

325
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,839
levels well basically because they

326
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,560
evolved from a very good mapping and

327
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
navigation system

328
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
and that's kind of the the main idea so

329
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,959
if we can solve

330
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,519
how to build a map and then navigate it

331
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
uh first on the navigation level

332
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
and then on a more abstract level then

333
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,920
we might be on our way to to uh

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,760
kind of a general um system for for for

335
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
a reason

336
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
yes blue thank you

337
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,120
uh thanks that was super helpful so i

338
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
really um

339
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
yeah that that opened up a lot of doors

340
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
so in relationship to another project

341
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
that daniel and i are working on it

342
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
seems like um from the family tree then

343
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,680
it would be easy to map over like a

344
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,839
genetic space a genomic space or even

345
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,519
like a phylogenetic space from one

346
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,160
species to the next or even like mapping

347
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
over recipes um like when you're cooking

348
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
or even like different types of art

349
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
so just kind of anywhere where there's

350
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
the adjacent possible it seems like that

351
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
that's where you can construct these

352
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,399
kinds of maps that's really neat

353
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
oh god

354
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,199
yeah um i i i think the the main the

355
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,680
main thing is how

356
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
how do you transfer

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,279
the action concept to to the the space

358
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
that you're looking at like in a family

359
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
tree the action is like

360
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,199
moving from one person to the other and

361
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,600
the the action type basically defines

362
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
the relationship between two persons um

363
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
i think that's kind of the

364
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,839
difficult part always like which is the

365
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,480
action space that you need to traverse

366
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
the world and then the second thing is

367
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
like what are the what are the locations

368
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
in the world and once you can map these

369
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
two

370
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,120
then i think you're pretty pretty much

371
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
done right it's like

372
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
it's it's finding a way of moving from

373
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,920
one location to another via these

374
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
actions and if you have the actions or

375
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,760
relations between entities you can

376
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
basically draw

377
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,959
an inference on what is now the relation

378
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
between a and b

379
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,730
given this structure

380
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,919
[Music]

381
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,440
awesome a few

382
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,560
points so

383
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,720
tim thanks for beginning with this nice

384
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
description about how we could add in

385
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,920
this

386
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
conceptual or in cultural

387
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,920
layer

388
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,480
and about generalizing across different

389
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
environments

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,279
and that reminded me of the work on

391
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
pattern languages and it's kind of a

392
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
bottom-up discovery and then it was a

393
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
great point like yes there's the

394
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,800
algorithms that generate

395
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,880
a house scene

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
but there might be something that does

397
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
that at a pixel level makes sense like

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
putting a toothbrush under a cabinet but

399
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
then semantically or culturally a person

400
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
will look at that it's like but that

401
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,399
doesn't make sense

402
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,560
and so then that would be like let's

403
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
just say it explored a bunch of

404
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,079
different warehouses and the commonality

405
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
was like it was always

406
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,360
rectilinear

407
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
shelving

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,120
there's a genre of warehouse that's like

409
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
always that way and then whether it was

410
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
like three shelves by ten shelves or the

411
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
other way around

412
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
there would be like another space that

413
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
those graphs would map to so that was a

414
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,880
very

415
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,839
nice

416
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,120
um piece

417
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
and then um

418
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
chris feels and michael levin just a few

419
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,800
days ago

420
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,639
wrote this paper competency in

421
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,279
navigating arbitrary space intelligence

422
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,519
as an invariant for analyzing cognition

423
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
in diverse embodiments

424
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,399
so

425
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,240
perhaps something relevant for us to

426
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,319
explore going forward what do you think

427
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,199
blue

428
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,199
i think these guys write papers like

429
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,119
faster than i can read papers which is

430
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
amazing

431
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,439
i know it was um yeah april 24th so

432
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
three days ago i have not fully read it

433
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
but but a lot of the figures look very

434
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,400
interesting and

435
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,690
um

436
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,160
[Music]

437
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
so um

438
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
and then but i want to continue on this

439
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,199
last

440
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,720
point about the actions and maps because

441
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
that kind of mapping and multi-scale

442
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,360
mapping and transmuting and translating

443
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,679
across different types of maps

444
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
is

445
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,559
kind of the what the multi-level slam

446
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,640
is it's what a single level slam is but

447
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,280
then the composability of this

448
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
discussion is what enables like there to

449
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
be a slam where it goes from a geometric

450
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
space to a topological space and then

451
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
from that into like a cultural or

452
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
narrative space or something

453
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
so

454
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
how does action

455
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,919
relate to maps

456
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
and i thought about that family tree you

457
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,559
mentioned how there was one

458
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
representation where the actions were

459
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
like just like well you know if you're

460
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,960
in a room shaped like a bifurcating tree

461
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
then the actions would be you walking

462
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
around that room so that's one action

463
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
then there's the cognitive action

464
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
as that entity is building its

465
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
knowledge representation of the tree

466
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
and that that is related to its planning

467
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
and its

468
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
preferences or all of this that isn't it

469
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,799
inferring the tree but it's like

470
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
figuring out how it's going to infer the

471
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,039
tree

472
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,720
and then there's like there's other

473
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
actions though there's the action though

474
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
we won't talk about it of how families

475
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
arise

476
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
there's all kinds of actions and the

477
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
tree is just a representation of some

478
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
other

479
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
process

480
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,559
so how do we think about all these ways

481
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
that action relates to maps and what

482
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
kind of maps are actionable

483
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
what about ones that are about action

484
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
but not actionable or all this

485
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,320
other possibilities

486
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
yeah i

487
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
i'm not entirely sure whether i'm

488
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
all the way with you with your

489
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,880
with your last explanation so i i think

490
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
that the second bullet like the action

491
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,840
of updating the genetic model

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,480
i would not necessarily consider that an

493
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
action i think that the updating of the

494
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,840
genetic model just arises

495
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,360
from from experience and trying to

496
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
minimize your free energy

497
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
anyhow

498
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
the

499
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
the action from uh

500
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,679
from the uh

501
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,559
the other actions i think is

502
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,760
like

503
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
what is the action concept on different

504
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
levels

505
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
for example in it to be more concrete in

506
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
the

507
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
in in the genetic model

508
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
we had the low level action which is

509
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
basically

510
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
a velocity command for the robot like

511
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,400
move

512
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
forward

513
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,720
or or turn around with this kind of

514
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
velocity

515
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
but then the higher level action

516
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
concepts would be we called it the move

517
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,159
which is like traversing the space from

518
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,320
one location to another

519
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
which is kind of uh

520
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,760
in this case

521
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
uh of course graining of the low level

522
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
action but i think for every level in

523
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
your abstraction hierarchy

524
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
there will be

525
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
an action concept that moves from one

526
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
thing to another

527
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,080
and

528
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,559
what that concept has to be will be tied

529
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,640
to whatever level of abstraction you're

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,159
modeling at that stage i guess

531
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,240
but i don't see any other actions

532
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
besides that per se

533
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,200
thank you jim blue so i think about like

534
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
at different levels of actions if if you

535
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
for example think about foraging right

536
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,559
so you can have like camps of human

537
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,720
foragers and the task of each individual

538
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,440
forager is to go out and find food so

539
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
you go out you find food and you come

540
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,640
back and you go out and you find food

541
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
and you come back and then like if it

542
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
takes too long to find the food then

543
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
collectively as a unit the camp decides

544
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
to move right so so you pick up and you

545
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
make camp somewhere else so that's like

546
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
a an example of like every day the

547
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,159
individual unit does something um some

548
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,720
task and then the collective makes the

549
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
decision based on the on the input of

550
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
the individual foragers or like the time

551
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,720
it takes them to find food so that's

552
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
kind of a way that like i can think

553
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,120
about the nesting of um of action

554
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
yeah and so so

555
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
so so i think we're on the same page

556
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,159
on that account because you you will

557
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
have at some point a very high level

558
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,240
generative model that

559
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,159
that encodes in the state like um

560
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,720
do we have enough foods if not

561
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,840
we uh

562
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
we collect if we don't find foods we go

563
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
to another state so it could be like a

564
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
very high level abstract map with a few

565
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
states and notes and you could drop i

566
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
imagine you can draw out like

567
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
um

568
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
a graph with nodes where every node

569
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,600
is kind of a specific state and then

570
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
doing an action brings you from one note

571
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,120
to the other it could be a note like

572
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,440
not enough food enough foods um

573
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
move to another location and then you go

574
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
from

575
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
none not enough foods to foraging which

576
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
brings you either to

577
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
which either brings you in the same

578
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,600
state or brings you to the state i have

579
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
enough boot which is fine and if you

580
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
keep on uh

581
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,360
residing in the not in a food state then

582
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
you decide to move and you might

583
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,039
so you could kind of imagine an abstract

584
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,000
map where you have this kind of dynamics

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,080
and the actions make sense and then at

586
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,880
some

587
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,039
some point you will have the

588
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,360
the task or the action in this level

589
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,360
that says search for food which at some

590
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
level down the road will

591
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,360
will be

592
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
driving actions for start walking or

593
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,520
start navigating or search for places

594
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,559
where

595
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,440
that

596
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
that that are promising for finding food

597
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,400
so

598
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
lots of levels of of a conceptual

599
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
hierarchy you will have different kind

600
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
of actions that bring you from one note

601
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,720
to the other where the note might be

602
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
like a general state of the

603
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
community which is like the very top

604
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
level that you just described and then

605
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
you also have like nodes that are like

606
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
physical locations in your environment

607
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
and then you also have like very low

608
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
level nodes that might just describe

609
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
like uh your current pose in the world

610
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
basically and and the lowest level

611
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,279
action will just be the the torques that

612
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,360
you do or the the muscle the muscle

613
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
movement that you do with your legs and

614
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
your hands it will be the very low level

615
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
so i think

616
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,480
um

617
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
you can you can draw this concept all

618
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
the way up and down with the verb

619
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
with many layers of the hierarchy and at

620
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
each layer

621
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
going from one state to another

622
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,360
this is basically the action

623
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
at that layer but the meaning will be

624
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,159
yeah different depending on on which

625
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,360
level you are

626
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
and

627
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,919
the

628
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,159
the difficult part i think is how how

629
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,640
could you how can you have these

630
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
concepts emerge from from from bottom up

631
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,520
and i'm not sure that whether it's

632
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
possible but at least we are we're

633
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
trying to get us as as high up as we can

634
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,640
basically

635
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,720
very

636
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
interesting yes thank you blue

637
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
um

638
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,159
so it's super interesting and and

639
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,480
definitely um

640
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,799
it's why i link next to semantic space

641
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
because when you're trying to

642
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
like communicate with someone like the

643
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
purpose of communicating can be you know

644
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,200
have many faces but but in in

645
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
communication it's like reaching a

646
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
shared understanding

647
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
and then like okay we have enough

648
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
understanding of that topic like let's

649
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
move on to another topic in a

650
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
conversation and so um that's why that's

651
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,520
like

652
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,400
very easily um it's very easy for me to

653
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,960
see like how the semantic mapping and

654
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
the spatial mapping

655
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
um can can link together but i can't

656
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
think of like why

657
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,200
um i mean like why why would people like

658
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
well maybe in genetic or genomic maps um

659
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,960
that also makes sense right like to um

660
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
like like what would be the action like

661
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,799
to evolve i guess is the action in in

662
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,200
kind of a genomic map

663
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
space but like think i guess

664
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
um maybe novelty and that's kind of

665
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
where active inference comes in like why

666
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,600
would you traverse

667
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,400
a a map of recipes or a map of different

668
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
types of art um and i guess like the

669
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,159
idea is in um in exploration like and

670
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
trying like what happens if i combine

671
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
these ingredients in this other way or

672
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,840
add this other ingredient or like where

673
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,760
is the adjacent possible like that's

674
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
where i kind of think that the

675
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
exploration the room for exploration

676
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
comes in and so when you when you

677
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,279
traverse the map um sometimes the action

678
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,880
is just to

679
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
to see what's next or just to to explore

680
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,840
or reduce uncertainty about about your

681
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,199
possibilities or affordances

682
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,279
yeah so i think once you

683
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,790
once you've nailed down

684
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,600
[Music]

685
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
the different nesting of states and what

686
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
are the different actions you can take

687
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,480
that bring you from one state to another

688
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,279
on a certain level

689
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,159
then basically the the

690
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,520
what you will do

691
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
can emerge just from from minimizing

692
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,799
expected free energy right and that that

693
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
would be the the

694
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
the powerful ingredient or the powerful

695
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,919
um

696
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
tool that active entrance gives you is

697
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
that once you

698
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,559
you i i i would see

699
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,080
building a map and or like a more that

700
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
kind of grass structure where you

701
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
connect notes and and the transition

702
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,159
between notes or then the actions it's

703
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,799
kind of a way to

704
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
build the generative model

705
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
that is a bit more complex than well

706
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,000
actually it's not that more complex but

707
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,679
then than the traditional a and b

708
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,039
matrices

709
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,720
um

710
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,679
and and in that way

711
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,000
you can apply the same principles right

712
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,480
let me write this one very important

713
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
point down tim because you said maybe

714
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
you could just unpack this

715
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
in active inference

716
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
being able to

717
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
provide a structure of the model

718
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,760
provides us

719
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
a way to optimize it using variational

720
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
bayesian methods message passing

721
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
software toolkits like forney lab active

722
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,440
block for instance pi mdp matlab spm

723
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,000
and i think that's something that's

724
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
subtle but interesting and different

725
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,279
from a lot of other

726
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
models where the mere data structure

727
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
doesn't lend itself to like

728
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
an implementable algorithm

729
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,879
what do you think about that

730
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,279
yeah i think that's very true and i

731
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,399
think one of the

732
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,360
um

733
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,440
one of the important things also in in

734
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,600
the in the whole um

735
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
slam system here is that

736
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,799
we basically move from uh

737
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,279
more or less high dimensional continuous

738
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,399
observation

739
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,799
and action space i mean you could

740
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,799
you could do any uh continuous um

741
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,279
you you can command any any number of

742
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
velocity uh that is sensible to the

743
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,679
robot and the the amount of uh pixel

744
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,760
information that uh that you can get is

745
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
also uh

746
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,799
very big if not close to infinite so

747
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,320
we basically move from this high

748
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
dimensional continuous spaces to

749
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,600
something that is more like a discrete

750
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,240
set of nodes that you can traverse which

751
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,799
is much more like

752
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,000
an a and a b and a c matrix like like we

753
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,559
are used to in by mdp so

754
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
just by enforcing

755
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
the model to learn this more discrete

756
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,840
state space that's that we can manage

757
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,559
is already a a big step that's that

758
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,919
would allow for um connected or active

759
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,279
inference to to to be applied basically

760
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
because one of the the biggest issue is

761
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,039
always like okay

762
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
um

763
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
you could use active inference for

764
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
planning but if your your state space is

765
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,559
so large then yeah just

766
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,520
you cannot just iterate over all

767
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,880
potential

768
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
uh policies and and calculate the

769
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,120
expected free energy and and pick the

770
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
best one because your space just blows

771
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,720
up but if you

772
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
are able to at some level

773
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,399
discretize it's through a limited set of

774
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,480
states that are applicable to your

775
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
current context then maybe you can start

776
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
iterating through all the potential

777
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,840
relevant behaviors it's like

778
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,080
um going back to the

779
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,559
to the foraging example if

780
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,880
you just have to choose between moving

781
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
versus foraging the problem becomes much

782
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,880
more easy than when you have to decide

783
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,919
for an any possible muscle movement that

784
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,200
you can do the next few hours right so

785
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
i think moving to a more um discrete set

786
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
of

787
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
states

788
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,520
is is crucial to to to scale these

789
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,000
methods to to to realistic suffix

790
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,519
awesome

791
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,039
so returning to this maps of action

792
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,240
question

793
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,679
and that's a little bit in contrast with

794
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,159
like the maps of meaning and i think it

795
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,799
points again to active inference as

796
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,600
always having inference and action as

797
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
like two approaches to minimize free

798
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,480
energy two ways to think about the same

799
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,679
process

800
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,039
um

801
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,240
and

802
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
i want to return to this question about

803
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,120
like what the actions and the moves are

804
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,559
so i'm imagining

805
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,440
uh blue on the foraging trip

806
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
and there's what was the

807
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,519
um

808
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
the semantics of the slam presented in

809
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,120
this paper

810
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
was it was a

811
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
location

812
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
based approach whether in a geometric

813
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,440
space

814
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
or in a um in a topological in a

815
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
relational space but am i in the right

816
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,159
position like is a question about

817
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
location satisficing

818
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,799
and then it can also

819
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
be thought of as like that entity is

820
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,440
existing at a location in cognitive

821
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
parameter space because this question

822
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,600
about estimate about space is a

823
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,320
cognitive parameter it's one about the

824
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,039
territory it's a map of the territory

825
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,760
but these are cognitive parameters

826
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,080
that can include like

827
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,840
am i paying attention am i where i want

828
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
to be with respect to how i'm paying

829
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,559
attention about things

830
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,279
and so to actually explore that i wanted

831
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,960
to juxtapose

832
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,290
um

833
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,880
[Music]

834
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
two different generative models that

835
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,159
we've seen

836
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,000
and keeping in mind also that that

837
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
capacity of active inference where being

838
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,480
able to form these generative models it

839
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,600
also is

840
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
helping us get towards applying them

841
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,880
so on the right is the structure of the

842
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
model

843
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,519
from your paper

844
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
on the left is a three level model but

845
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,880
there's also a two level one that i can

846
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,919
pull up and it's from the sandvik smith

847
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,360
at all paper

848
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,080
on computational phenomenology

849
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,000
and mental action

850
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
and so the actions in this case

851
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
are happening at the level of what am i

852
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
perceiving what what is the action at

853
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,159
this sort of like motor level and

854
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,080
whereas in in your

855
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
multi-level slam

856
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,039
this

857
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,159
level

858
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,039
was about space still again from the

859
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,679
geometric smaller scale tactical scale

860
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,279
of space to the topological bigger scale

861
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,440
strategic level of space

862
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,080
but it's still about the territory

863
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,679
and in here

864
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,640
uh a somewhat analogous

865
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,679
multi-scale nesting of the

866
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,519
partially observable markov decision

867
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,640
process

868
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,000
is used to represent not a spatial

869
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
layer

870
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,120
or coarse graining

871
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,240
but actually in a tensional layer

872
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
so what do you think this what does this

873
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,799
make you think of or what does nesting

874
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,039
pomdps mean

875
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,760
and what could it mean

876
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,560
well in essence what it

877
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,119
what it basically does it puts

878
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,440
the higher level

879
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
it's like a prior on your lower level

880
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
right on the

881
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,280
on the the next so

882
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,480
in in in my figure like the

883
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,280
one

884
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
if you have um

885
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,199
if you have a belief over your state in

886
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,800
the red box

887
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,679
then basically this gives you a prior on

888
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,159
what you expect to

889
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,879
observe in in in a single blue box

890
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,760
and

891
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,359
in this case in my case it's indeed

892
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,320
very tight to the to the spatial domain

893
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,879
but in essence it can give you a prior

894
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,320
on on

895
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,760
on on any aspect of of the level below

896
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,280
right

897
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,760
and i think that's what they do uh on

898
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,800
the

899
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,000
on the in the left model then

900
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
where also if you have like an inference

901
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,359
on

902
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:11,650
um

903
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,079
[Music]

904
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,200
if you have a belief on the the orange

905
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,640
states in the left mole it basically

906
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,800
gives you a prior on what

907
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,839
what states you expect to observe

908
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,160
uh or to believe in the in the in the

909
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,560
blue one there here's going to be i

910
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
think this is figure 12 instead of

911
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
figure 5.

912
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,480
so this is the generalized deep model of

913
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
action and here the emissions

914
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,000
of the hidden state at the higher

915
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,359
internal mental level cognitive domain

916
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,720
the emission

917
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,480
mediated by the a

918
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,000
matrix just like it would be in a retina

919
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
but the emission of a is

920
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,079
the hidden state

921
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,400
at the lower level s uh one but also the

922
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,960
uncertainty parameters like the variance

923
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
estimates

924
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,680
on every

925
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,800
other

926
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,040
core um kernel parameter so yeah

927
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,800
so in the slam what other which of these

928
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
other generalized connections do you

929
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
think have

930
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,920
relevance for the robotic slam context

931
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,560
wait i think i think it makes a lot of

932
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,920
sense to also have like um um

933
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
something modulating your your uh your

934
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,279
precision parameters it's like it's like

935
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,480
it's like having a

936
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,079
certain

937
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,640
trust on your observations for certain

938
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
environments for example

939
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,520
you could you could

940
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,320
you couldn't for example if you go if

941
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
you go to your seller

942
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,079
you might know that the lighting

943
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,839
conditions will not be optimal and

944
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,240
you'll have different precision than

945
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
when you're in your kitchen for example

946
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,440
just thinking out loud so i i think it

947
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,520
makes sense to

948
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,760
to have this hierarchical structure on

949
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,960
any

950
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,760
on

951
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
on anything that that you have beliefs

952
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
over or that anything that can

953
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,280
have importance on on your on on making

954
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
better predictions basically so you can

955
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,800
have a less

956
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,839
you can you can have better predictions

957
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,720
if you have a good prior on

958
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,480
how precise you would expect your

959
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,640
observations to be here so that's why it

960
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
makes sense to

961
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
have a model evolved that that

962
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,799
takes this into account i guess

963
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,079
it just is very interesting like

964
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,240
if the nesting can represent

965
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,760
staying within the same domain

966
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,680
and of course graining of like okay you

967
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,160
know district states

968
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,440
continent like a sort of within the same

969
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,640
genre

970
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
but different course grainings

971
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,040
or it can seemingly

972
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
at least in the case of mental action

973
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,000
and

974
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,599
hyper prior optimization

975
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,599
modeling in general

976
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,680
like investigation and research in

977
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,839
general

978
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,920
those cases this is not a course

979
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,599
screening it's it's a something totally

980
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,800
different

981
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
so if the interface can mean two totally

982
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,720
different things couldn't it

983
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,800
couldn't there be a third

984
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
implication too

985
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
or

986
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,079
do these exhaust

987
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,720
the implications of nesting

988
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,359
can nesting only refer to like a like

989
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,320
kind nesting for example nested time

990
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
scales nested spatial scales

991
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,839
or

992
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,480
the cognitive action

993
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
of basically

994
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,079
removing something from the sensory

995
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,520
territorial

996
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,480
domain

997
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
and then like entering it once into the

998
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
cognitive domain

999
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
but then once it's been entered into

1000
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,440
so-called hidden internal states which

1001
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,280
are not even being proposed to actually

1002
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,320
exist

1003
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
in space or time

1004
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,480
then you're kind of in

1005
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,760
in like the matrix simulation slash

1006
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,440
structure learning on cognitive models

1007
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
and then it's not like that's going to

1008
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
be nested

1009
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,879
i don't know

1010
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,359
but i i think it's just uh

1011
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,520
in the end

1012
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,040
it's it's just finding the um

1013
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,440
finding the most simpler model that

1014
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,480
explains it but not simpler right

1015
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,839
and

1016
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,480
you could imagine

1017
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,040
a model that that operates on the lowest

1018
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,480
level always

1019
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,359
and

1020
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,839
that indeed just has uh the case of a

1021
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,000
robot has pixel inputs

1022
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
and has

1023
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,760
torque or velocity output

1024
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,800
and

1025
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,280
builds a model that can

1026
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
predict

1027
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,880
four hours in the future accurately

1028
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,359
but then you also realize that this

1029
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,319
should be a very very very complex model

1030
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,560
it it it must always

1031
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
it's almost the environment right

1032
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,319
and

1033
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,319
this is unknowledgeable and the only way

1034
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,319
to kind of

1035
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,920
do it then is to

1036
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,240
to start adding structure to the model

1037
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
and start um factorizing out different

1038
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
variables and in essence nesting is

1039
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,079
nothing else but factorizing out a

1040
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,640
certain variable

1041
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,160
so so

1042
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
i think in the end it's just a matter of

1043
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,599
finding

1044
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,599
the model that

1045
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,200
most accurately

1046
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,280
predicts what's going to happen

1047
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
with the least complexity and building a

1048
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,560
hierarchical

1049
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,319
nested model

1050
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,880
is one way to to

1051
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,440
to make this happen

1052
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,200
the way that blue spoke about the

1053
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
genetic

1054
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,040
nesting in this sort of aristotelian

1055
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
sense giving rise to in the genetic

1056
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,800
sense and in the sort of cellular and

1057
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
then how you framed it as the simplest

1058
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,319
model but not any simpler which is often

1059
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,400
at least in the bayesian area framed as

1060
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,000
being like the aic or bic

1061
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,839
pareto optimal model like some kind of a

1062
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
trade-off of accuracy and complexity so

1063
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,640
on

1064
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
and

1065
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,800
it's like there's a process of

1066
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,240
structure learning

1067
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,920
because we want to know okay

1068
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,599
categorically should we be fitting a one

1069
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
level two level model what kind of

1070
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,839
structure within the three level nesting

1071
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,319
which one of these edges are going to be

1072
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,560
um making the machine learning model in

1073
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,280
real life run a hundred times slower and

1074
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,200
not even converge which one of these

1075
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,520
edges are we going to be just totally um

1076
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
in the dark without

1077
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
bayesian model selection on structures

1078
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,240
including cognitive structures

1079
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,319
and those structures we're not picking

1080
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,640
the final best this structure learning

1081
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,960
is not picking the final best

1082
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,480
parameterization

1083
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,640
and this is kind of like how carl is

1084
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
always speaking about developmental

1085
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
robots

1086
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,800
and how out of the factory or whatever

1087
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,040
it's going to be in a learning

1088
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,640
mode

1089
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,880
so the structured learning is on

1090
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
learning structures

1091
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,119
and the learning structures are about

1092
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,040
perception

1093
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,280
including the actions that one is

1094
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,440
observing themselves to be doing because

1095
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,839
if we couldn't observe the consequences

1096
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,760
um or at least even our own action

1097
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,480
states in some way there'd be like a

1098
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,040
total disconnect and our we could never

1099
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,680
get our action policies

1100
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,839
it would just be like the motor babbling

1101
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,079
and the sort of uncoordinated movement

1102
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,440
and i'm sure a lot of robotics and

1103
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,200
evolutionary simulators

1104
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
like that's why they have that wobbly

1105
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,920
leg

1106
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,960
phase

1107
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
because i think a lot of those models

1108
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,240
they don't know they're wobbling they're

1109
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
just implementing like in this super

1110
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,160
high dimensional space of motor policies

1111
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
they're just

1112
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,000
they're not getting the feedback so this

1113
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
is it is like a nesting

1114
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,240
um

1115
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,560
cool very

1116
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,880
interesting um

1117
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,400
direction here and i think there's a lot

1118
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
more to explore

1119
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
about what kinds of nestings because

1120
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,839
maybe it's actually that attentional

1121
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,720
layer

1122
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,040
that you described in your

1123
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,000
opening thoughts

1124
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,800
about the uh higher level of abstraction

1125
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,119
that was taking in a graphical

1126
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,640
a graph

1127
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,839
i mean

1128
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,760
you know maybe that is the layer that it

1129
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,000
just comes on top right here and the

1130
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,880
current the can

1131
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,079
gets input into

1132
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,680
some other

1133
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,839
thing

1134
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,760
let's uh look at some of the

1135
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,079
formalisms and figures

1136
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,720
or if blue or if anyone in the live chat

1137
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,399
has any questions they can totally ask

1138
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,839
i have a question on this or if there's

1139
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,640
another

1140
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,839
equation or formalism that

1141
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,359
it's clearer to address this question

1142
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,640
this

1143
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,280
p

1144
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,200
on the left side you can describe it in

1145
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,400
your own words but it's a joint

1146
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
distribution of multiple variables

1147
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,359
how does one go from

1148
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,640
knowing what

1149
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,280
variables they want to include in the

1150
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
joint distribution

1151
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,119
like what arguments they want that

1152
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,720
function to take

1153
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,839
and then

1154
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,440
a specific partitioning factorization

1155
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,000
like is this the only factorization or

1156
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,920
how do we make

1157
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,000
this factorization based upon what we

1158
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,760
kind of know what we want to model maybe

1159
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,560
even very early

1160
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
yeah so

1161
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,760
so basically

1162
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
going from the left hand side to the

1163
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,359
right hand side

1164
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,119
you can basically

1165
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,240
um

1166
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,800
one-on-one derive it from the figure

1167
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,839
basically

1168
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,880
so

1169
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,800
if you look at the figure

1170
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
you see that the

1171
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,160
that pie

1172
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,640
has no incoming errors

1173
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,920
so

1174
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,760
there will be no

1175
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
conditioning on on pi

1176
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,839
and then if you look at the action

1177
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,319
uh um

1178
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,599
notes

1179
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,079
then you see that these all get an input

1180
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,440
arrow from pi so then you know that

1181
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,000
pi is actually influencing the action

1182
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that you do so this will be a

1183
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,599
probability of uh action given by and so

1184
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,760
that's basically how you could you can

1185
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
write down

1186
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,839
the equation just by looking at the

1187
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,640
figure basically so typically how we

1188
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,200
if we if we start off with a new with a

1189
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,520
new type of model

1190
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
we start off indeed with just listing

1191
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,160
all the variables that we want to model

1192
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,280
and then we start with drawing out a

1193
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,440
potential diagram like we have on the

1194
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
right

1195
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,839
and

1196
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,920
try to make sense out of that

1197
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,640
and once we have that

1198
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,280
the the equation just falls out

1199
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,359
basically and it's always a matter of

1200
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,560
thinking like

1201
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,839
which variable has an influence on which

1202
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,040
other ones

1203
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,920
uh

1204
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,560
for instance you can also mix make make

1205
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,640
your own assumptions there like one the

1206
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,079
assumptions that we

1207
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,680
often make is like okay the hidden

1208
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,640
states

1209
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,119
should be kind of should be markup

1210
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,440
markovian so

1211
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,400
once we know the state at time t

1212
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,480
we don't need any

1213
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,880
information on the past anymore

1214
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
uh to generate the current observation

1215
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,800
for example so so these kind of

1216
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,079
assumptions

1217
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,839
um go also in and they will then decide

1218
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,560
on

1219
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,839
uh

1220
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,319
on which things you need to

1221
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,680
condition

1222
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,200
because you could also

1223
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,119
uh if if in general uh you have

1224
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,680
uh the joint distribution you can also

1225
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,720
just restrict yourself to basically base

1226
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,040
rule to come up with the factorization

1227
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,880
so that this could be then

1228
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,359
p of pi times

1229
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,119
p of

1230
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,559
a given pi

1231
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,359
times p of s given am pi times p of uh o

1232
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,160
given s a pi so if you just use base

1233
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,359
rule you can also come up with a

1234
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,119
factorization that will be perfectly

1235
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,760
valid but that might not

1236
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,119
um

1237
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,040
be easy to implement so you basically

1238
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,559
search a bit for

1239
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,160
what is uh

1240
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,480
possible and you add some assumptions in

1241
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,760
order to make it

1242
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,640
work

1243
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,160
intuitively

1244
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
as well as practically

1245
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,440
if that makes sense

1246
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
thanks a lot so you mentioned the first

1247
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,520
two terms here it would just be great to

1248
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,640
hear for the green blue and the purple

1249
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,119
term just how do you describe the way

1250
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
that you look at the graph and then

1251
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,880
translated it here

1252
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,079
and then i'll have another question but

1253
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,839
first up

1254
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,480
yeah so the green blue and purple

1255
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,200
yeah so for the green one you look at um

1256
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,559
the initial

1257
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,280
notes of the blue part so this it's like

1258
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
your initial

1259
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,440
uh

1260
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,200
your initial state

1261
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
uh at the start of sequence and you

1262
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,520
cannot and this one it um

1263
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,319
this one has now uh

1264
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,720
oh yeah oh no this will be the yeah

1265
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,280
sorry this will be the the ultimate

1266
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,400
original

1267
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,319
um stated

1268
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,200
i don't think that um i don't think that

1269
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,000
the

1270
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,839
the equation on the left corresponds to

1271
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,200
the uh to the figure because there's no

1272
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,558
locations and moves in there

1273
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,200
right okay yes this is a lower level

1274
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,359
model that we're looking at yeah and yes

1275
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,040
okay the initial condition is

1276
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,520
conditionally independent of other edges

1277
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,680
yeah

1278
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,520
yeah and then and that so so the the

1279
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,960
green and the blue is basically your

1280
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,359
initial start state so you you have to

1281
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
bootstrap somewhere so you have some

1282
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,119
prior on your starting state and then

1283
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,760
from then on the next states will all

1284
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,680
depend on the actions you take so then

1285
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,319
it's in the in the purple the first term

1286
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,880
is basically saying okay my next state

1287
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,040
will depend on my previous state and the

1288
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,400
action i took

1289
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,079
and then the

1290
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,319
the second one in the purple is saying

1291
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,119
okay the action that i take will depend

1292
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,880
on my policy

1293
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,599
and

1294
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,079
the last term then just says okay my

1295
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,640
current observation it only depends on

1296
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,960
my current state because i assume that

1297
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,839
all information of that time step is

1298
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,960
basically

1299
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,760
uh

1300
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,920
um

1301
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,720
it is represented in in in the in in

1302
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,760
this state at that time

1303
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,280
this is really

1304
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,240
powerful and i think that the fact that

1305
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,559
all future states

1306
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,160
are part of a combinatoric

1307
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
relationship with action it really shows

1308
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,559
how deeply action is embedded within

1309
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,520
active inference like there simply is

1310
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,800
not

1311
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,599
a consideration of future observations

1312
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,760
or latent states

1313
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,280
except for

1314
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,920
conditioning action on policy

1315
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,559
and conditioning states on action

1316
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,280
so

1317
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,440
policy is above actions that are

1318
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,119
selected that are actually taken and

1319
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,319
enacted

1320
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,440
but all inference is conditioned on

1321
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,200
action selection which is conditioned on

1322
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,559
policy

1323
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,960
and there aren't two separate models

1324
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,680
like an expectation module and then like

1325
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,800
an action selection state value mapping

1326
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,920
um state policy mapping policy statement

1327
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,559
all those kinds of constructs that are

1328
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,599
meant to bridge the gap between

1329
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,680
inference and action being two sides of

1330
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,079
the same coin to minimize free energy

1331
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,520
literally also for those machine

1332
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,880
learning models

1333
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,559
it's just really interesting how that is

1334
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:11,760
all

1335
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,040
concisely simplified and integrated in

1336
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,280
active inference and so i want to ask a

1337
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,920
question on this purple term

1338
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,839
which is is anything known

1339
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,640
about the computational complexity

1340
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,680
of

1341
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,400
changing h

1342
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,240
with respect to

1343
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,559
how you actually ran the models like

1344
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,640
sort of in principle or how you actually

1345
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,400
ran it like is it like if you go like

1346
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,640
one two three four five time steps does

1347
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,760
it go like time step squared is it like

1348
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,440
time steps

1349
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
triple squared or what is it

1350
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
yeah so i think you have to distinguish

1351
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,040
uh

1352
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,240
two uh two differences here so

1353
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
when when just

1354
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,920
modeling the system

1355
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,200
then h

1356
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,040
doesn't really matter it's just it could

1357
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
go to infinites

1358
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,559
without without loss of generalization

1359
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,520
so it's like your your agent gets bored

1360
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,040
and then it's

1361
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,440
it operates like this until the end of

1362
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,160
its life and that could be hp so from

1363
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,960
from just modeling the system

1364
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,559
it doesn't really matter and just say

1365
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,440
okay

1366
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,480
this is the

1367
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,280
the

1368
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,800
the time

1369
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,839
horizon i consider the system

1370
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,559
and this is then how how i assume it's

1371
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,240
it it acts basically

1372
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,640
it's a different story if we look at an

1373
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,880
actual implementation where

1374
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,359
you suddenly have to um

1375
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,079
yeah choose an age um yeah

1376
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,880
if i implement this model how long do i

1377
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,680
need

1378
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,240
how long do i want this thing to be able

1379
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,160
to predict because of course

1380
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,319
if you

1381
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,160
if you build a model that is predicting

1382
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,319
and then you have to check uh whether

1383
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,559
your prediction was correct and you use

1384
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,920
the kind of models that we use that

1385
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,319
basically want to back propagate all the

1386
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,440
way back

1387
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,280
to

1388
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,000
to have a gradient update step

1389
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,079
then of course the edge becomes

1390
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,640
determined by practical

1391
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,240
considerations like

1392
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,559
how much memory does my machine have to

1393
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,800
keep all these intermediate states and

1394
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,880
memory and i can still back propagate

1395
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,599
through

1396
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,559
uh through this model um

1397
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,680
so

1398
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,960
so so then it

1399
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
it's basically

1400
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,440
an implementation implementation driven

1401
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,880
choice on how how far in the future do

1402
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,599
you want to model this thing uh

1403
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,200
or can you model this thing because it

1404
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,680
might also be that if you try to predict

1405
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,480
too

1406
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,680
far ahead

1407
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,480
that

1408
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,240
there's so much noise that it doesn't

1409
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,200
even make sense to to try to predict it

1410
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,280
so for the future so it can be um

1411
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,440
it can be driven either by what makes

1412
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,160
sense for this environment versus

1413
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,319
how much

1414
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,559
how much computes and memory do i have

1415
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,240
to make this happen basically

1416
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
awesome

1417
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,240
blue do you wanna

1418
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,200
yes go for it

1419
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,920
so

1420
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,640
i have a question over this figure and

1421
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,920
then um also over the

1422
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,839
it's formalism six i don't know if you

1423
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,280
have that anywhere on the slides daniel

1424
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,760
if you want to grab it

1425
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,800
yep

1426
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,280
okay so in uh

1427
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,640
formalism six like the same observations

1428
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,200
are there at both levels at the lower

1429
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,119
level and the higher level and this

1430
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,599
makes a lot of sense for something like

1431
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,319
foraging right like the the lower level

1432
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,319
the group is gonna the individual is

1433
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,559
gonna go out move forward and then at

1434
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,119
the higher level it's going to um the

1435
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,280
group is going to move right so in a

1436
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,799
hierarchical sense

1437
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,960
um that makes sense and then

1438
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,480
in figure two

1439
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,119
um in the in the legend of the figure it

1440
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,839
says that the higher level operates on a

1441
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,599
coarser time scale

1442
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,680
so where like the the lower level

1443
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,480
decisions are made at you know 15 minute

1444
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,160
time scales or one hour time skills the

1445
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,880
higher level is like a day or something

1446
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,760
some similar relationship um and that

1447
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,440
also would make sense for something like

1448
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,240
like foraging um this is kind of relates

1449
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,680
back to the question of emergence and i

1450
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,040
just wonder

1451
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,839
if you can allow for

1452
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,839
so like not all systems operate this way

1453
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,559
and um you know here's the big big

1454
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,440
question

1455
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,480
right like like um

1456
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,760
every uh like organ in my body does

1457
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,079
something different right like so

1458
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,839
and then like you know all my cells are

1459
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,359
getting dehydrated and then suddenly

1460
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,440
like i say i'm thirsty and i drink right

1461
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,839
it's not like my cells cannot like move

1462
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,839
to go like take a drink of water

1463
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,079
so like in a hierarchical sense where

1464
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,079
where the higher level is doing a

1465
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,520
different action

1466
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,400
than

1467
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,040
the lower level have you thought at all

1468
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,599
about how to try to navigate something

1469
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,000
like this like we're at the higher level

1470
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,319
the action is totally different well the

1471
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,799
time scale might be coarser but but here

1472
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,640
the variables change um and this is

1473
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,319
something i think about a lot and so i'm

1474
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,920
always collecting input and i just

1475
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,799
wonder what you think time

1476
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,000
yeah so

1477
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,799
so basically the

1478
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,680
i guess the the core question is

1479
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,640
how

1480
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,240
if you take a decision at the higher

1481
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,359
level which is like a move in this case

1482
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,640
how does it triple down to um

1483
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,640
a lower level action

1484
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,839
that might not even be related to

1485
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,160
the move you want to make at the at the

1486
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,680
higher level something like that right

1487
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,799
so

1488
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,720
basically how how this happens is that

1489
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,280
if you if you look at a single level

1490
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,240
um

1491
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,640
so like a vanilla active inference

1492
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,079
formulation

1493
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,400
then at some point

1494
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,599
you

1495
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,799
you tie in the preferences from from a

1496
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,480
prior it's like

1497
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,720
these are my preferences so that's what

1498
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,920
i want to obtain um in in

1499
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,599
in this one level

1500
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,799
and in the hierarchical model how how

1501
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,079
how we do it is that basically the

1502
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,799
the

1503
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,480
the action

1504
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,160
on the higher level so in this case

1505
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,960
making a move to another location it

1506
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,640
basically sets

1507
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,319
uh

1508
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,280
so if we if do you have a bigger version

1509
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,559
of the

1510
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,960
of the of the image maybe uh they know

1511
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,160
so suppose that we go from um so we are

1512
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,119
now at l big t

1513
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,720
and we want to make a move to um l

1514
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,480
big d plus one

1515
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,559
so this basic so at some point this is

1516
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,559
the decision we took we want to go to

1517
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,440
the

1518
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,200
to the other one

1519
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,160
then basically we can use then the

1520
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,760
um the a matrix or the the liquid model

1521
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,440
that then says okay if i'm at l t plus

1522
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,160
one then this is the kind of state and

1523
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,319
pose that i expect

1524
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,680
so this is then being fed back downwards

1525
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,960
as like this is now the preference for

1526
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,280
the lower level model to obtain

1527
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,240
this kind of um state

1528
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,720
and then at the low at the lower level

1529
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,200
you again have your expected free energy

1530
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,559
to work out the low level policy and

1531
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,480
actions that actually bring you closer

1532
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,839
to that kind of preference

1533
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,079
but at the same time so at each

1534
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,280
actual fine-grained tank step

1535
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,839
you get low level observations that then

1536
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,400
give you new beliefs over the state and

1537
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,240
the pose you're in which might give you

1538
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,880
more which might give you more

1539
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,960
information on the location that you're

1540
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,040
in and then either

1541
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,359
at some point you will reach

1542
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,839
the preferred location and then

1543
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,520
okay great success

1544
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,359
or it might be that something went

1545
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,000
terribly wrong and you'll end up in a

1546
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,440
different location

1547
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,520
but then it basically

1548
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,079
also goes up again and at the higher

1549
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,400
level you'll then say okay i'm now not

1550
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,319
at the location i wanted to be but

1551
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,880
apparently some different one that i was

1552
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,359
so then you start planning again

1553
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,960
at that level to

1554
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,880
to correct and

1555
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,119
search for a new step to take that will

1556
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,200
then ripple down as like a preference

1557
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,480
for the lower level and that's how

1558
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,599
everything kind of um continues on going

1559
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,520
so

1560
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,720
the

1561
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,480
you have your your

1562
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,640
the you use the likelihood model that

1563
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,119
maps the states from higher level model

1564
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,520
to i believe on

1565
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,680
lower level states and these this

1566
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,599
lightweight model becomes kind of your

1567
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,440
preference for the lower level which

1568
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,000
then has your inference process there to

1569
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,160
do to infer the actions and that's how

1570
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,440
you can kind of

1571
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,799
decouple them

1572
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,150
from semantic meaning as well

1573
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,680
[Music]

1574
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,839
this is awesome it reminds me of the

1575
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,880
kind of

1576
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,520
question that people often ask

1577
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,359
where do you want to travel where would

1578
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,880
you like to travel where would you

1579
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,760
prefer to travel

1580
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,319
it's often interpreted in a very

1581
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,000
life scale

1582
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,839
of analysis like i would really like to

1583
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,079
go to this other area

1584
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,760
so then that's like let's think about

1585
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,680
that as the biggest level so where would

1586
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,799
you like to travel i'd like to go to

1587
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,960
california

1588
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,400
how will you get there

1589
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,000
i'll take a plane

1590
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,640
where will you go to take a plane

1591
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,559
i'll drive to the airport

1592
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,280
how will you drive to the airport

1593
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,359
i'll get in my car

1594
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,760
how will you get in your car i'll leave

1595
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,839
my room how will you leave your room

1596
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,240
i'll get out of my chair like that's

1597
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,200
very much the nesting between the top

1598
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,799
level having more of like this

1599
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,200
topological

1600
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,440
where i want to be

1601
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,119
which then is

1602
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,920
imposed and propagated

1603
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,680
as and sets the constraints and

1604
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,079
opportunity for this lower level

1605
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,240
like how i will get there because it's a

1606
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,599
totally where would you like to go

1607
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,960
somebody could think in their head i

1608
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,119
want to go to california in my life

1609
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,559
and then the answer to where you want to

1610
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,960
travel would be like to the next room

1611
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,480
but be like that wasn't really the scale

1612
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,200
of the context of the question

1613
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,640
but this like really shows how the the

1614
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,720
multi-scale

1615
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,040
nesting of location

1616
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,040
lends itself to

1617
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,599
heuristics and algorithms that help us

1618
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,200
like chunk

1619
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,000
complex navigation tasks like

1620
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,040
navigating to somewhere in california in

1621
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,680
the next few years

1622
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,400
but you can't do the roll out for all of

1623
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,119
the actions taken at the chair level

1624
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,200
for that because it's going to be

1625
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
too many

1626
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,559
explosions of combo torques tim

1627
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,880
yeah and just to to to add into in into

1628
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,359
the storyline at some at some level in

1629
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,039
in the hierarchy you you you are like

1630
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,960
okay i want to go to my car

1631
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,480
but then you could say okay but i need

1632
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,400
my core can you say i don't know where

1633
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
they are where are my car keys so then

1634
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,359
suddenly from having this really goal

1635
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,200
directed

1636
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,680
nesting at some point you say okay i

1637
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,839
need some more information

1638
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,920
at this level to actually

1639
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,799
reach my goal and so at that level it

1640
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,359
might switch to more epistemic forging

1641
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,960
which will then

1642
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,760
um ripple down to the level below like

1643
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,160
okay let's let's take a look in my

1644
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,240
kitchen or at the kitchen table maybe

1645
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,960
you're there and so that's how at every

1646
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,440
level of the hierarchy you have this

1647
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,720
exploitation exploration trade-off and

1648
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,880
the outcome of that inference process

1649
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
will then ripple down to the level below

1650
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,799
like this is the preference for this

1651
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,720
level to obtain and this is how

1652
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,960
everything then um starts flowing

1653
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,079
this is awesome blue

1654
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,480
so i'm gonna now now ask another really

1655
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,240
hard question so so this is really

1656
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,720
awesome and it reminds me of um like how

1657
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,720
the the higher level constrains the

1658
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,640
actions at the individual level it

1659
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,200
reminds me of um and i i know like you

1660
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,480
were intending to take this out of

1661
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,240
semantic space but it puts it back into

1662
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,240
semantic space for me i was having a

1663
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,039
conversation over the weekend in which

1664
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,240
uh the at complexity weekend and one of

1665
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,400
the participants brought up a kind of

1666
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,319
political and controversial talk about

1667
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,960
the topic and and i was you know they

1668
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,640
said so so what do you think and i said

1669
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,680
i think i shouldn't talk about that

1670
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,960
and then they said

1671
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,039
okay well so what do you want to talk

1672
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:49,760
about

1673
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,119
which is like kind of like a uh um

1674
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,039
like an odd question to have in a

1675
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,119
conversation but it constrains like when

1676
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,280
you when you assign a topic or like here

1677
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,440
i mean we're obviously assigning a topic

1678
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,440
also um you know we're here to talk

1679
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,039
about this paper and related things that

1680
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,720
might come up but

1681
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
in like a spontaneous conversation when

1682
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,160
you assign a topic it very much

1683
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,440
constrains the the the conversation to

1684
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,920
um it limits the topic or at least

1685
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,599
starts a seed

1686
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,160
uh and i wonder like why do we have to

1687
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,760
talk about anything like can't we just

1688
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,640
sit or like can't we just like you know

1689
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,920
talk about the first thing that comes to

1690
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,520
mind or can't we just like be and be

1691
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,200
quiet uh but for a lot of people that

1692
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,480
that space is kind of awkward uh um and

1693
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,079
where then does emergence fit into the

1694
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,480
model which this is the hard question or

1695
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,760
or can it fit into the model like when

1696
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,200
um

1697
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,799
you know what one

1698
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,599
component of the lower level says well

1699
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,359
maybe we'll move to the right and then

1700
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,720
everybody says okay and they start to

1701
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,000
pull to the right and then okay well

1702
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
maybe we'll pull to the left like so so

1703
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,319
does it is there room for emergence or

1704
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,319
it's always constrained by the

1705
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,960
assignment of the top level

1706
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,720
yeah you spoke about the top level

1707
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,960
propagating and rippling down so what's

1708
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,079
the other

1709
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,640
direction there

1710
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,520
well i think

1711
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,559
i think ultimately

1712
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,039
you need um

1713
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,559
you need some preferences at the highest

1714
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,200
or at any of the levels right and if

1715
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,720
there's

1716
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,520
no such preference

1717
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,480
then

1718
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,640
indeed we end up in this situation like

1719
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,599
yeah

1720
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,920
what happens now and there's there is no

1721
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,960
real constraint and anything can happen

1722
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,359
but i think typically in life we're in

1723
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,240
the at some level we'll always have a

1724
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,680
preference and that

1725
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,520
that defines our

1726
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,039
our behavior

1727
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,480
i i guess

1728
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,119
i was i was actually talking to a

1729
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,680
colleague on on similar things like as a

1730
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,240
human we always have like we make plans

1731
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,200
or

1732
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,160
we have

1733
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,160
there's always something on our mind to

1734
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,960
do and we were like yeah but if you look

1735
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,960
at the monkey in the zoo he just

1736
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,119
he can just sit there

1737
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,640
and do nothing

1738
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,400
so what goes

1739
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,280
what goes on in in in the animal's mind

1740
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,079
is like okay all my preferences are met

1741
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,720
i don't i'm not hungry i i have a safe

1742
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,599
place

1743
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,680
so i just do nothing

1744
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,400
so yeah it's an interesting question

1745
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,559
like

1746
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,039
what what happens if we don't have

1747
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,880
if we don't have any urgent preferences

1748
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,480
that need to be met i don't know

1749
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,760
well

1750
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,640
in the zoo example that behavior of for

1751
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,039
example low levels of activity might

1752
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,039
also be associated with like learned

1753
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,160
helplessness or trauma or like a freeze

1754
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,640
reaction or the um

1755
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,440
the

1756
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,280
affordances are not presenting

1757
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,240
themselves

1758
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,920
in a in a certain way so then that

1759
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,799
speaks like the ambiguity of cognition

1760
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,799
with respect to behavior

1761
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,480
and like the robot could be bumping into

1762
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,160
the wall

1763
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,920
for a lot of cognitive reasons it could

1764
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,520
prefer to bump into the wall it could

1765
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,359
prefer to do something else and so

1766
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,400
there's like there's a many many-to-one

1767
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,599
mapping

1768
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,880
with

1769
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,720
cognitive systems and behavior like

1770
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,160
someone could be thinking

1771
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,760
have different reasons or

1772
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,680
preferences for why they emit

1773
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,119
a given sentence so that's part of the

1774
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,520
complexity but also like the opportunity

1775
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
of the cognitive and then also the

1776
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,480
classic lewis carroll quote um probably

1777
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,039
also misquoted slash

1778
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,039
alt quoted many other

1779
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,880
places but it's like a great you know

1780
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,760
folk

1781
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,119
active

1782
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,480
question

1783
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,359
if you don't know where you want to go

1784
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,160
then it doesn't matter which way you go

1785
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,440
if you don't have high precision ish

1786
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,280
on your preferences

1787
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,119
at location

1788
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,440
then

1789
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,400
it's a wash it doesn't matter which

1790
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,680
policy selection you're taking

1791
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,119
because why would it the only way that

1792
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,039
you could justify well well i like this

1793
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,559
way okay because you have a preference

1794
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,400
for simplicity or you want to head off

1795
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,079
in this direction those are all valid

1796
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,440
it's not to say that if you do know

1797
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,439
where you want to go you're right or

1798
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:18,960
you're doing the right thing or it's

1799
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,120
going to be easy or possible it's just

1800
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,000
like

1801
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,799
if you don't have preference then it's

1802
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,399
not possible

1803
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,679
to make

1804
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,040
any kind of decision worth evaluating

1805
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,960
and that also speaks to the

1806
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,839
the

1807
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,238
integration of preference

1808
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,479
in active inference as a means of

1809
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,198
guiding epistemic and pragmatic value

1810
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:42,880
rather than

1811
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,198
reward learning reinforcement learning

1812
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,920
which only centers on pragmatic value

1813
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,479
and the implicit preference is more

1814
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,120
reward would be better

1815
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,560
and then there has to be all these ad

1816
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,040
hoc ways of introducing epistemic and

1817
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,679
balancing the paper clip maximizing into

1818
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,120
these models

1819
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,238
um blue and then tim

1820
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,279
so great example daniel um and i think

1821
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,279
back to uh

1822
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,080
the monkey in the zoo and

1823
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,560
if the preferences are the of the monkey

1824
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,319
might just be constrained by the

1825
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,880
zookeeper like the the monkey just does

1826
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
whatever the zookeeper wants it to do

1827
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,198
and then that made me really think about

1828
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,080
um

1829
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,399
parents and children in the united

1830
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,920
states so is there always some kind of

1831
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,920
downward causation right so so like if

1832
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,640
you have a child um and in many families

1833
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,880
and not only the in the united states

1834
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,040
but it's different culturally right so

1835
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,040
even the school system in europe is very

1836
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,640
different than that in the united states

1837
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,920
so the kids just kind of go to some

1838
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,080
generic school the parents may or may

1839
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,759
not have some preference for what they

1840
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,120
want the child to be i want you to be a

1841
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,479
doctor i want you to be a lawyer i want

1842
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,640
you to take over the family business or

1843
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,158
whatever and the child

1844
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,480
grows in these constraints with this

1845
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,159
predetermined idea so there's some kind

1846
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,480
of top-down causation happening from

1847
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,400
parents to children but in many

1848
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,600
americans

1849
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,920
and like we're just floundering over

1850
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,640
here so so what drives then the

1851
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,560
preferences of the

1852
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,640
of the child when the when there's no

1853
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,560
downward causation and and this is kind

1854
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,239
of where exploration comes into play

1855
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,159
right like so you might try this major

1856
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,679
you might try that major or you might do

1857
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,280
this or you might do that and you know

1858
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,880
you have this this incredible amount of

1859
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,640
freedom and so you really kind of don't

1860
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,440
go anywhere or like maybe you take one

1861
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,520
path in 25 different directions and then

1862
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,600
just end up right where you started

1863
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,280
so like you just start a whole bunch of

1864
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,679
things and then don't really get down

1865
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,679
make any progress on any one path in

1866
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:36,880
contrast to europe where i think you

1867
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,960
have to choose in eighth grade like stem

1868
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,679
or not stem or something like this so so

1869
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,920
it's it's interesting so so i think this

1870
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,520
lack of downward causation so the

1871
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,360
emergence may this is what i'm picking

1872
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,440
up from our conversations the emergence

1873
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,199
may come from

1874
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,520
just an exploratory

1875
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,000
an exploratory structure and like in

1876
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,080
this exploration you just kind of find

1877
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,679
some direction through exploration

1878
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,760
thank you

1879
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,080
maybe maybe two notes so so one thing is

1880
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,960
if

1881
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,480
if we don't have preferences then we

1882
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,239
still have our information gain term

1883
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,120
right so

1884
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,440
this might drive you to

1885
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,040
at least some

1886
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,640
um

1887
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,040
some form of exploration or some drive

1888
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,760
to

1889
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,920
kind of

1890
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,880
at

1891
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,719
at one point

1892
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,760
infer as as good as you can where you

1893
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,040
are

1894
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,760
or on the or on the other hand

1895
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,640
maybe uh some actions will

1896
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,199
yield you more in more new information

1897
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,120
to update your model like your the

1898
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,400
information gain on your mobile

1899
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,120
parameters so this might still drive

1900
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,800
some exploratory

1901
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,480
behavior

1902
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,120
and then how how preferences come to be

1903
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,480
shaped i guess one relevant uh

1904
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,120
piece of related work is is done by uh

1905
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,640
by north sagitt

1906
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,360
on on uh her paper system where it's

1907
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,040
actually all about

1908
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,440
can you learn preferences from from

1909
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,719
behavior where

1910
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,040
the idea is kind of like

1911
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,760
the the things you usually usually do

1912
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,080
when you you're happy with

1913
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,239
basically grow to be your preferences as

1914
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,640
well and you're kind of attracted to to

1915
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,199
revisit these states um

1916
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,920
and

1917
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,719
this also ties in like parenting like

1918
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,040
just seeing your parents or having your

1919
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,080
parents

1920
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,960
um taking you to some states

1921
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,679
just make it happen that these become

1922
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,239
your preferred states also virtually the

1923
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,960
the things that you just get to do

1924
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,880
because that's what people around you

1925
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,920
and you do

1926
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,320
just become your preferences because you

1927
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,400
you you see it being done and you're

1928
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,800
doing it all the time so

1929
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,640
by by doing it it becomes kind of your

1930
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,840
your prior on things that happen and

1931
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,920
that you have to do or that you are

1932
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,080
expected to do and i i think

1933
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,880
it's it's kind of related as well to

1934
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,360
to the work of noor like how

1935
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,760
maybe the things that that you you just

1936
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,120
ought to be doing and that somebody uh

1937
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,840
takes you to do become becomes kind of

1938
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,400
your your preferences

1939
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,520
great points so when you said that even

1940
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,760
without preferences there's still info

1941
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,560
gain

1942
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,880
so that does hide a little preference

1943
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,320
which is a preference to resolve

1944
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,719
uncertainty but

1945
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,600
if you remove that like preference or

1946
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,520
assumption then it's kind of like okay

1947
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,800
there's a million ways to make your

1948
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,280
gaussian distribution worse

1949
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,880
you can just inflate the variance and

1950
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,400
your error will get infinitely high so

1951
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,480
putting those types of inferences away

1952
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,600
then there's the info gain approach

1953
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,760
and then the the things that reminds me

1954
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,120
of was the uh idea of novelty search

1955
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,640
and so this is within the field of

1956
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,960
evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary

1957
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,360
computation where there's often this

1958
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,199
very exacting

1959
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,239
fitness

1960
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,120
test

1961
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,679
the top five percent fastest runners are

1962
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,920
going to survive or they're going to be

1963
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,120
evaluated on the task every single time

1964
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
and then people realized and thought

1965
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
about how well maybe it's not like super

1966
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,640
harsh selection maybe they're sort of

1967
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,719
oscillating selection pressures on the

1968
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,199
task or maybe multiple tasks are being

1969
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,320
selected and then sort of like the

1970
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,719
um add absurnum but not to say

1971
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,040
ineffective version of this argument is

1972
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,840
forget the task and the performance and

1973
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,159
the fitness on that task

1974
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,360
and either entirely or partially use

1975
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,960
novelty search

1976
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,400
and simply sec select for novelty of

1977
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,920
different kinds

1978
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,159
and so it it does need to make its way

1979
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,080
back to task performance like

1980
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080
homeostasis maintenance

1981
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,760
but this is like an interesting thread

1982
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,719
that was sort of like balancing out the

1983
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,159
overly

1984
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,760
pragmatic

1985
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,080
value view and the second thing that it

1986
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,120
reminded me of is the figure in

1987
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,920
um

1988
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,840
the active inference on discrete states

1989
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,239
basis synthesis by decosta at all 2020

1990
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,750
and so here um

1991
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,850
[Music]

1992
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,280
in the case of

1993
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,199
no priors

1994
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,880
on the left

1995
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,280
bayesian surprise optimal beijing design

1996
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,840
intrinsic motivation curiosity and the

1997
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,239
infomax principle

1998
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,320
and so it's like

1999
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,080
interesting to see

2000
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,040
how

2001
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,719
under different special cases that are

2002
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,159
shown here no priors

2003
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,880
which might be no prior preference but

2004
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,480
let's think about that

2005
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,239
no ambiguity

2006
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,920
like no no space between the observation

2007
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,080
and the hidden state total observability

2008
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,600
that's the mall

2009
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,040
where we were speaking about the

2010
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,280
robotics last time like where you can

2011
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,679
just have perfect resolution of your

2012
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,440
spatial location

2013
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,320
then there's no ambiguity or risk a

2014
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,120
deterministic action environment where

2015
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,080
you know exactly how well each stock is

2016
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,520
going to perform

2017
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,920
then you can make expected value

2018
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,560
decisions purely based around utility

2019
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,040
and then no ambiguity or priors on the

2020
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,280
right side here with maximum entropy

2021
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,080
principle and jane's and max ends

2022
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,000
so it's like this action perception loop

2023
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,400
has so many degrees of freedom

2024
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,520
that it's just wild

2025
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,440
and the special cases

2026
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,239
help us zoom in on like

2027
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,800
the information gathering aspect of a

2028
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,920
given level epistemic gain the utility

2029
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,080
oriented components of a given level

2030
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,000
that's the pragmatic

2031
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,719
policy in the utilitarian component and

2032
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,239
then

2033
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,640
there's this balancing

2034
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,239
of

2035
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,000
the pragmatic and the epistemic and the

2036
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,320
ability to flex and to adapt between

2037
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,480
those which is why

2038
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,480
some are excited about active inference

2039
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,280
as speaking to this explore exploit

2040
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,520
dialectic in a way that hasn't been

2041
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,520
approached by like we'll learn a

2042
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,280
parameter that switches between them

2043
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,360
this is like a very different way

2044
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,239
to

2045
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,640
to integrate all those things by finding

2046
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,480
an action perception loop that's a

2047
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,920
generalization

2048
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,800
of some of these cases

2049
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,199
and it's really interesting that

2050
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,080
um

2051
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,280
this is a

2052
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,719
discrete state space synthesis

2053
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:39,520
so

2054
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,440
all but implying that there hasn't been

2055
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,280
a synthesis

2056
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:48,080
on continuous and hybrid state spaces

2057
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,560
so how do discrete and continuous

2058
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,360
variables come into play in

2059
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,480
just like this paper or robotics more

2060
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,640
generally like how does that feels think

2061
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,640
about discrete and continuous actions

2062
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,400
yeah so in so in in this paper um

2063
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,719
it's rather all contin it's uh i'm sorry

2064
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,880
it's rather all discrete right so we use

2065
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,640
discrete time steps

2066
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,840
um

2067
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,000
we

2068
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,560
and

2069
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,440
we

2070
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,760
personally we didn't do a lot of

2071
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,280
research on actually the continuous time

2072
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,320
for formalism um

2073
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,800
i know that for example pablo de nios

2074
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,440
has done a lot of work and mathematics

2075
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,840
in delft where they actually do the more

2076
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,600
continuous time

2077
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
torque control low level control of

2078
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,000
robotic arms and so on

2079
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,840
and there's uh it's an entirely

2080
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,280
different formalism and i'm i'm

2081
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,440
personally not too

2082
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,440
i'm not an expert on on that kind of

2083
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:56,400
systems but i i i i i guess that

2084
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,440
similar

2085
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,120
uh ideas um

2086
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,000
are are there as well on the

2087
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,159
information gain versus reference

2088
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:09,590
resolving kind of

2089
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,040
[Music]

2090
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,080
planning

2091
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,760
but yeah i i cannot really say a lot

2092
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,239
about it

2093
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,320
what is it like in this warehouse

2094
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,880
like do people work in there or is it

2095
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,239
just a test area or what is it on the

2096
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,639
shelves

2097
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,280
yeah it's just a test area so so

2098
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,840
basically when we um

2099
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,560
when we enter that particular building

2100
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,199
this room was allocated as we we have a

2101
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,440
data center in in the building so it's

2102
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,520
the ground floor of our building

2103
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,360
and this room is actually

2104
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,839
um

2105
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,520
allocated as as the

2106
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,280
as a part of the data center but at the

2107
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,199
moment we don't have uh

2108
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,120
we don't have enough racks to to fill it

2109
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,920
but it was like like to be future proof

2110
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,880
and so

2111
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,679
uh it was just an empty space

2112
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,320
and then people started uh using it as

2113
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,719
as storage space for all of the things

2114
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,000
that are just

2115
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,159
lying around and nobody really has like

2116
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:20,000
a place for them to be so they they uh

2117
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,080
they had some racks over there with all

2118
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,520
kind of

2119
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,920
random stuff that needs to be stored

2120
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,480
somewhere like it's that you also have

2121
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,199
like

2122
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,960
a lot of old server cases from uh from

2123
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,679
older machines over there that are just

2124
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,480
sitting there in case we we need a spare

2125
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,560
part or something so it's like it's like

2126
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,719
generic storage space

2127
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,960
and then we figured yeah if we have the

2128
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,840
space anyway anyway we can start doing

2129
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,040
experiments in this and so we have um an

2130
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,199
area now where we have some robot

2131
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,960
manipulators

2132
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,440
uh and then at the same time we have

2133
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,480
this more kind of warehouse setup that

2134
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,120
kind of reflects how in in actual

2135
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,960
industrial warehouses thing might things

2136
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,600
might be and so you share the space with

2137
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,880
um

2138
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,120
with researchers working on wireless

2139
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,600
localization that then

2140
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,600
put some beacons on and see how the

2141
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,280
wireless signal propagates with all

2142
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,679
these metal shells around and these kind

2143
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,480
of

2144
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,719
things so it's just now a generic space

2145
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,159
that we can use for

2146
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:27,120
experimentation on navigation but also

2147
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,639
localization

2148
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:29,440
all

2149
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,360
signal propagation through different

2150
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,480
kinds of

2151
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,800
material these kind of experiments all

2152
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,320
happen happen there now

2153
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,159
cool

2154
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,520
the

2155
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,600
part you mentioned about the the

2156
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,760
electromagnetic radiation and how it

2157
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,080
propagates it like makes me think about

2158
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:48,880
how

2159
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,239
you have this

2160
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,960
current bot using only the visual light

2161
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,080
like we kind of talked about that

2162
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,440
previously it could have all kinds of

2163
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,040
different sensors but it only has the

2164
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,560
visual light

2165
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,920
um and it doesn't use any kind of wi-fi

2166
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,840
updating like what if every minute you

2167
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,440
know it gets an update of its actual

2168
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,440
location so that could be in the model

2169
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,520
and then different kinds of

2170
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,120
um

2171
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,159
situations could be enacted simulated

2172
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,840
and then enacted like what happens when

2173
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,280
the lights go off

2174
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,199
what if the wi-fi

2175
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,400
goes down

2176
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,440
and then

2177
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,400
that

2178
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,880
is where the generative model

2179
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,840
being

2180
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,000
on board

2181
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,880
is

2182
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,760
really

2183
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,920
going to reveal

2184
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,400
like the robustness of the approach

2185
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,440
because if it does have this internal

2186
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,199
spatial sense

2187
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,120
the light's going off

2188
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,679
may or going very dim which changes the

2189
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,080
pixel values of every pixel and the

2190
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,040
ratio of the colors and like everything

2191
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,880
but maybe just the the

2192
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,760
very light you know the the exit sign

2193
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,440
that light alone is enough for the

2194
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,080
camera to still do to relearn

2195
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,239
and just have enough input from the

2196
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,239
observation layer

2197
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,600
so it's like very cool that you can

2198
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,400
control the space like you have policy

2199
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,199
over this space whereas in an operating

2200
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,880
environment that you don't control it's

2201
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,520
like you are subject to the generative

2202
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,960
process

2203
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,199
emitting actions to you

2204
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,199
which might have regularity

2205
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,040
or favorability but like you don't

2206
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,639
control them and then that's what the

2207
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,600
lab

2208
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,000
is is like a space where

2209
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,239
there are nest mates or robots or

2210
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,760
learners but then the lab can also set

2211
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,960
policy

2212
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,639
with feedback from the bottom up but

2213
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,639
also it is a place where the policy can

2214
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,080
be controlled and that can help the

2215
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,120
robot like learn and develop so that's

2216
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,320
kind of cool

2217
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,920
and it again it speaks to what carl is

2218
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,679
saying about like the learning robots

2219
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,600
like there is a time scale

2220
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,440
at which the

2221
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,520
community or the collaborators are in

2222
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,719
feedback

2223
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:55,920
with this

2224
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,840
niche like without this paper or maybe

2225
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,320
that yeah without this paper

2226
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,520
there wouldn't be the discussion but

2227
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,360
then without this being enacted that

2228
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,520
wouldn't be the paper

2229
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,199
so there's a lot of interesting dynamics

2230
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,440
there

2231
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,679
yeah maybe to to add-ons and errors that

2232
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,360
you were describing on turning off the

2233
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,360
lights and so on and using other sensor

2234
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,840
modalities so we actually do have

2235
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,080
experiments with um

2236
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,120
with for example also modeling the so on

2237
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,840
this on this robot in particular at the

2238
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,280
front you see a planer lidar scanner so

2239
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,159
it just scans

2240
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,639
with a light ray and it measures the

2241
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,639
distances um

2242
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,440
and then the the red thing on there is

2243
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,480
actually a radar so that's one chirps

2244
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,638
and

2245
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,239
at six

2246
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,920
79 gigahertz chirps and then it listens

2247
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,719
for the the reflecting signal and and

2248
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,080
and that's also a way to kind of

2249
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,159
estimate where are obstacles around you

2250
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,000
and which distance are they and and

2251
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,040
which velocity are they approaching are

2252
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,639
going further from you

2253
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,840
we actually

2254
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,600
also create models on these kind of

2255
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,280
modalities and and we could actually

2256
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,560
show that it could kind of imagine uh

2257
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,159
late lighter scans uh in inside the ale

2258
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:16,880
or

2259
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,679
how how radar would evolve if the robot

2260
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,080
is moving

2261
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,120
and

2262
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,520
some other things that we did which was

2263
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,080
uh these things are uh

2264
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,800
especially ozone cattle who is uh the

2265
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,719
first author of this paper as well did a

2266
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,040
lot of work on this so so what one of

2267
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,159
the the things he did was if we now put

2268
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,880
like a gable gutter in one of these ales

2269
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,760
then when the robot would drive over it

2270
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,880
you would see

2271
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,120
a whole different type of dynamics

2272
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,520
because it would bump up and go down and

2273
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,880
if you monitor

2274
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,679
the

2275
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,199
basin surprise so basically the detail

2276
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,120
divergence between your

2277
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,080
uh

2278
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,679
between your dynamics model and then

2279
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,000
your posterior you could see like a huge

2280
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,199
spike in kind of surprise signal

2281
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,639
on uh

2282
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,960
on this kind of uh dynamics like this is

2283
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,560
something weird that's happening and you

2284
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,800
could kind of use this to to see is

2285
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,159
everything going normal or is this

2286
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,000
something weird going on

2287
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,639
suddenly in in in my space

2288
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,719
and we also did this where we had the

2289
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,600
robot driving around but also people

2290
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,159
passing by just walking by

2291
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,320
and if that was in the center trains on

2292
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,400
that model it would actually not be

2293
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,440
surprised if it see if it sees uh people

2294
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,760
passing by and if you would let it like

2295
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,800
imagine

2296
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,960
how would it be if if you drive forward

2297
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,960
and sometimes you could see of course

2298
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,000
very blurry because it's like a uh a

2299
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,600
reconstruction we could you could see

2300
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,920
kind of skinny

2301
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,199
signatures passing by as if people was

2302
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,199
as if a person was walking past a robot

2303
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,040
like yeah this is a scenario that can

2304
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,360
happen it just learned it

2305
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,320
which was

2306
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,800
pretty fun so maybe discovers the fun

2307
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,040
fact

2308
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,560
that is a fun fact

2309
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,920
yeah

2310
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,639
this is the total do uh

2311
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,800
do robots dream of electric sheep like

2312
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,719
that whole question it's like

2313
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,239
if their generative model is generative

2314
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,400
sure depends on what you mean by dream

2315
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,960
if it's only a recognition model

2316
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,840
probably not

2317
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,820
that's very funny um

2318
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:28,960
[Music]

2319
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,120
let's take just one

2320
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,120
last look since we talked a lot about

2321
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,880
the factorization

2322
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
of the one

2323
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,199
level which was i think a great

2324
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,560
discussion let's just look at the

2325
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,000
factorization

2326
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,520
of this multi-scale setting

2327
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,320
and uh just

2328
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,159
any other things that people want to ask

2329
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,080
or any other thoughts you have but what

2330
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,320
is happening with the factorization here

2331
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,480
and similar to how you kind of like

2332
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,280
um

2333
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,000
gave a natural language representation

2334
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,080
of the um

2335
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,639
the factorization that we looked at

2336
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,760
here

2337
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,639
um

2338
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,719
this is the single level just within the

2339
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,639
blue level and so what is happening with

2340
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,320
the multi-scale factorization

2341
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,159
yeah so

2342
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,600
if you here look at the at the bottom

2343
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,280
you basically

2344
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,719
um see again the

2345
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,040
the the same kind of factorization as

2346
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,280
you had before right so it's like okay

2347
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,920
my current state depends on my previous

2348
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,560
state and action and my action depends

2349
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,840
on the policy

2350
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,920
and my observation depends on my current

2351
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,400
state and the only thing that is added

2352
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,400
here is this um

2353
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
uh the the

2354
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,400
the term on uh p's which are the poses

2355
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,199
so it's the the second term on the yeah

2356
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,320
that uh

2357
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,920
that one no

2358
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,199
is pose

2359
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,360
yeah exactly and so what we basically

2360
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,080
what we did here is like since we

2361
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,480
we are working on this uh

2362
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,040
navigation setting and

2363
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,880
we already had some inspiration from

2364
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,960
existing slam approaches

2365
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,360
we decide like yeah it actually makes a

2366
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,679
lot of sense to treat

2367
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,639
poses as kind of a first-class sentence

2368
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,840
in in in the model and we

2369
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,679
we really would like to have like

2370
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,000
because you you kind of know how poses

2371
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,679
evolve given the action right because

2372
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,840
it's pretty simple uh

2373
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,080
you can have a pretty simple uh

2374
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,360
transition model that says okay if you

2375
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,760
move forward then your pose will

2376
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,520
increase in the direction that you're

2377
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,520
heading basically so that's

2378
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,480
a very basic way of of of entering your

2379
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,960
pose and your poses is of course also

2380
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,040
very relevant for knowing where you are

2381
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,719
so that's why we decided to kind of

2382
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,040
split off the uh

2383
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,679
the abstract states and have an

2384
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:54,800
additional

2385
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,719
post state that was dedicated for um

2386
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,080
for modeling uh where you are in in in

2387
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,920
the space um like in in this uh in this

2388
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,440
pose continuous attractor network

2389
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,960
and then if we go to the level above

2390
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,440
then there you have a similar structure

2391
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,639
but now the action is the move and so we

2392
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,960
have a prior on moves and then you move

2393
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,159
from one location to the next given the

2394
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:25,600
move that you're doing

2395
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,639
and

2396
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,000
then you have like the connection

2397
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,239
between the upper level and the lower

2398
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,000
level which is yeah what's now the

2399
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,840
probability of

2400
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,400
having a certain lower level state given

2401
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,480
that i am in this location and what

2402
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:42,480
would be my pose in uh of the robots if

2403
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,880
i'm in this location basically

2404
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,760
and

2405
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,360
that then sums it up i guess

2406
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,159
what is the purple term

2407
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:53,840
and why is there the

2408
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,600
big pie at the end of it

2409
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,880
yeah so the

2410
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,400
um the purple term basically is

2411
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,520
your initial uh

2412
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,080
your initial state for

2413
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,719
a higher level so it's i think it's like

2414
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:11,679
the

2415
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:12,880
uh

2416
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
if you look at the blue

2417
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,120
box it's the

2418
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,639
the gray

2419
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,040
uh note

2420
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,080
so it's like you you you observe

2421
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,679
the initial um observation from the new

2422
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,280
blue block facing that's your current

2423
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,840
time step

2424
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,280
cool

2425
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,280
and then and then the the big pie is

2426
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,760
then from then on you basically

2427
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,840
uh go for a number of

2428
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,239
like sub level lower level time steps

2429
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:49,040
which is basically the

2430
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,960
the counts that you make within the blue

2431
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,199
box basically so we have like this

2432
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,960
this big d and small t which basically

2433
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,960
uh or are like to just denote

2434
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,520
time step in within the the fine grained

2435
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,719
level or time step within the

2436
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,040
the orange level but

2437
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,080
um

2438
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:10,960
in

2439
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,960
in actual timing

2440
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,120
like the big d

2441
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,639
uh

2442
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,239
going from big d to big d plus one is

2443
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,480
just like a number of time steps on the

2444
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,600
actual

2445
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,520
real discretized time let's say so

2446
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,000
suppose if we say that our sensor

2447
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,120
operates at 10 hertz like every 100

2448
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,840
milliseconds you get a new observation

2449
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,199
that's like the

2450
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:37,360
the lowest granularity

2451
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,280
timestamping

2452
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,920
and then the the big d just is like okay

2453
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,960
i i know i'm at uh

2454
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,280
current time step and now it could be

2455
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,360
one second later it could be two seconds

2456
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,000
later could be five seconds later it's

2457
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,120
just like

2458
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,480
going from big t to big t plus one just

2459
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,080
says there

2460
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,600
some time has elapsed from going to this

2461
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,080
discrete discrete thing that i call a

2462
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,400
location to this next thing that i call

2463
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,280
location but exactly how many

2464
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,480
actual

2465
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,199
seconds have passed yeah that's that's

2466
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,719
up to the model basically because we

2467
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:17,440
have this system that that looks at

2468
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,440
how much surprise or how much um

2469
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,639
information

2470
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:25,280
that that's did i gain from

2471
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,080
uh

2472
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,360
from moving

2473
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,440
and this basically determines when you

2474
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,440
shift from one location to another so

2475
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,000
the the concept of location is based on

2476
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,719
this threshold on when we add a new node

2477
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,080
to the map so we we added this

2478
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,440
big d

2479
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,760
uh notation just to

2480
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,600
introduce kind of a

2481
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,159
time step on the higher level but this

2482
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,800
is totally abstracted from the actual

2483
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,840
timing

2484
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,080
which you do have for the lower level so

2485
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,639
the lower level there the small t is

2486
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,760
actually um the rate at which your

2487
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,080
observations come in basically so this

2488
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,000
could this could be fixed to like 100

2489
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,080
milliseconds every 100 million seconds

2490
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,800
you shift time step but when the big d

2491
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,000
shifts it all depends on when you infer

2492
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,880
to be

2493
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,840
in a new location basically

2494
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,840
if that makes sense and you mentioned

2495
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,679
that there was a parameter you kind of

2496
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,520
just empirically determined when it made

2497
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,080
sense to add the new node um yeah but

2498
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,320
then the the frequency of the discrete

2499
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,400
time steps at the bottom was 100 hertz

2500
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,199
like so 100 um or 10 hertz 100

2501
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,960
milliseconds and that was just the

2502
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,440
sampling rate of all of these

2503
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,880
features

2504
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,040
um

2505
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,920
wow there's so much happening with

2506
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,199
nesting

2507
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,040
there's the movement from the geometric

2508
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,719
to the topological

2509
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,719
there's the movement from something that

2510
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:51,760
is

2511
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,600
at a smaller finer scale to something

2512
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,920
that is enclosing it

2513
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,520
really enclosing it

2514
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,440
or conceptually

2515
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,239
enclosing it in this kind of way that we

2516
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,080
were talking about the cognitive domain

2517
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,920
earlier there's this movement from the

2518
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,360
kronos

2519
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,040
to the kairos

2520
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,280
from the actual

2521
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,199
sensor

2522
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,760
defined speed that things are happening

2523
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,239
in the world to like the timeliness

2524
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,360
of when it's

2525
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,480
time to think that you're in a different

2526
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,000
location and then in the biological case

2527
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,440
it it was woven so clearly to this

2528
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,719
multi-scale navigational capacity of the

2529
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,639
of the he

2530
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:33,600
system

2531
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,800
because like if you said i'm in a

2532
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,239
different place

2533
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,400
in my room that might be

2534
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,320
a foot but if it to be in a different

2535
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,480
place on the train might be the next

2536
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:47,360
train spot and so the way that language

2537
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,239
is

2538
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,840
vague yet

2539
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,560
does allow us to really drill

2540
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,639
into what model

2541
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,880
what was valuable about that for you

2542
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,800
what were you curious about in that

2543
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,760
moment

2544
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,360
like these kinds of ways that we

2545
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,280
interrogate ourselves and that we can

2546
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,760
also engage in conversation so yeah blue

2547
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,960
why don't we

2548
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,440
sit silently

2549
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,480
maybe for

2550
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,560
you know performance art stream number

2551
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,199
one it could happen but also there's

2552
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:18,239
uncertainty to resolve and uh message

2553
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,760
passing to be done otherwise it's

2554
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,400
implausible that we're gonna coordinate

2555
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,280
in

2556
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,119
our like

2557
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,639
actions or in our

2558
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:27,920
thoughts

2559
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,159
um

2560
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,040
if you have any other like ideas or

2561
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,719
thoughts or questions or places you want

2562
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:35,920
to jump to

2563
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,560
we can totally do so otherwise this is a

2564
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,760
great

2565
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,320
thought too

2566
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,320
what are the next steps you've mentioned

2567
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
several things but just

2568
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,880
what would be like a next outcome or

2569
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,960
deliverable or thing that you're hoping

2570
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,840
to see in the niche and maybe even enact

2571
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,239
yourself

2572
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,840
yeah some of the

2573
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,000
things that i was discussing today with

2574
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,679
one of our one of the students just

2575
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,360
today actually is to

2576
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,800
um

2577
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,800
to basically

2578
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,520
uh work on

2579
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,800
can you

2580
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,560
because one of the biggest limitations

2581
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,960
now is that

2582
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,960
in order to navigate you're basically

2583
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,639
limited to

2584
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,800
what it has seen before right so we

2585
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,520
still need the um

2586
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,920
we still need to hand control the robots

2587
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,760
through the lab to build a map and then

2588
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,400
only when it had has visited

2589
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,119
the whole space it can start

2590
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,520
it can even just then start navigating

2591
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,199
it basically

2592
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,800
so one direction is can we kind of

2593
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,400
have the robot itself

2594
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,400
um navigate

2595
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,960
and one idea there is to

2596
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:53,920
again

2597
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,320
linking to our story about preferences

2598
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,480
at different hierarchical levels

2599
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,480
maybe we could have like a

2600
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,400
preference on the lower level that just

2601
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,080
says okay i don't want to bump into

2602
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,040
things

2603
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,920
and

2604
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,679
um

2605
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,280
if you don't have a map

2606
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,239
the only thing you you want is

2607
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,880
on the one hand be curious and and try

2608
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,040
to update your model as good as you can

2609
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,040
but also not bump into things and then

2610
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,480
you have like this robot that just

2611
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,639
starts driving around and at the same

2612
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,690
time building a map and then

2613
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,000
[Music]

2614
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,840
at least you you

2615
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,440
can can just put it anywhere it will

2616
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,040
start mapping and at some point you can

2617
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,280
you say okay the robot now you know go

2618
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,400
to uh

2619
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,480
now search for this particular object

2620
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,320
and then you give it the goal and it

2621
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,080
starts exploring

2622
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,520
um

2623
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,320
maybe it can imagine oh this is maybe

2624
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,400
the location where i lost saw something

2625
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,239
very similar so this is probably the

2626
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:53,520
location i want to go to um and and then

2627
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,600
you can have it like more gold directed

2628
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,239
behavior so this is one thing uh we were

2629
01:38:58,239 --> 01:38:59,760
thinking about and then another

2630
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,639
limitation is also that like the edges

2631
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,880
between the notes are also only the

2632
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,040
edges that you actually

2633
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,679
um traversed once

2634
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,679
so for example one

2635
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,400
one stupid thing is that it it does not

2636
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,119
know that if um

2637
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,880
if it went from one location to the

2638
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,280
other it can actually turn around 360

2639
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,880
degrees and go back and it will be at

2640
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,280
the same location because in this visual

2641
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,440
space that might be a totally different

2642
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,840
thing and if if you never

2643
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,040
thought it

2644
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,119
or actually control that you turn around

2645
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:35,280
360 degrees it will never make the link

2646
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,600
okay i can actually do this so one of

2647
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,480
the

2648
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,719
things that we were exploring so that

2649
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,440
can we use our lower level genitive

2650
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,199
model to kind of

2651
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,320
imagine

2652
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,760
potential links between notes and then

2653
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,679
kind of add these

2654
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:55,199
links to the map as if you kind of

2655
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,600
um

2656
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,239
visited those before or maybe add some

2657
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,400
weight to these links so you know yeah

2658
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,480
this this might be a link and this is

2659
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,560
the likelihood of this link but at least

2660
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,239
you can take them these links into

2661
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,320
account when planning is okay i'm

2662
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,080
feeling adventurous so maybe it's time

2663
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,880
to explore this link or um

2664
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,040
for this particular goal if this link

2665
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,119
exists i never tried it but if

2666
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:21,360
it exists it will it will be a huge

2667
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,040
shortcut to reach this goal so i'm

2668
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,119
willing to take this gamble

2669
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,600
in this situation and to have like these

2670
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,480
kind of uh behaviors by by just kind of

2671
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,920
imagining

2672
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,719
which kind of locations can i visit that

2673
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,760
maybe i never tried this before but

2674
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,679
given the the things i've learned from

2675
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,000
this environment this might be the case

2676
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,320
so i'll just try it uh so maybe this

2677
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,920
kind of um

2678
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,080
these two points are basically are the

2679
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,280
next things

2680
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,840
on our lists to uh to start exploring

2681
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,360
nice it is like

2682
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,719
knowing

2683
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,800
other streets you could take

2684
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,880
what if the road i always take is

2685
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,480
blocked

2686
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,800
and then

2687
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,199
there are so it's just cool and what

2688
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:12,559
arises after your

2689
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,000
after you're implementing it and and in

2690
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,679
the chat stephen has been making some

2691
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,440
comments about the door and we discussed

2692
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,280
like being in the hallway and then

2693
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,600
there's the pixel contrast and then like

2694
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,080
if there were a higher level concept of

2695
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,280
door

2696
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,960
probability of a door at that location

2697
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,280
so that that pixel change abruptly could

2698
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,960
be associated with a door

2699
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,719
and then

2700
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,320
then there's this

2701
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,239
location of door

2702
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,800
not just the pixel level mapping but

2703
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,400
then there's like what does the door

2704
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,679
bridge to

2705
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:44,960
and

2706
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,360
what if it explores a closed room and

2707
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,280
now the door opens

2708
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,040
and then it can say well now i'm curious

2709
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,800
about what's out

2710
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,800
there or like what is that node a

2711
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,320
bottleneck and that's like the door as

2712
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,080
markov blanket you know what's what

2713
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,119
happens when you train it up on the

2714
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,600
warehouse including with curiosity and

2715
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,239
then you open the door what's gonna

2716
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,760
happen

2717
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,679
but these are awesome directions so

2718
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:08,719
thank you for

2719
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:11,280
sharing it blue do you have any final

2720
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,840
comments or questions

2721
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,159
thanks this was super interesting to

2722
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,800
think about and explore and try to map

2723
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,520
on to my map of my cognition in my mind

2724
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,719
yeah agreed it was really cool to see

2725
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:29,520
the the analytical formal and the

2726
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,159
biological and the robotic

2727
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,840
coming together

2728
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,080
and so

2729
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,320
much appreciated tim for joining us and

2730
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,560
to adam for joining previously and all

2731
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,880
the other authors so

2732
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,360
hope to see you around

2733
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,239
yeah it was also for my site was a a

2734
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,480
nice discussion opened up a lot of new

2735
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,320
perspectives also for me and new ideas

2736
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,360
so uh thank you for that

2737
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,880
thank you tim see you later thank you
