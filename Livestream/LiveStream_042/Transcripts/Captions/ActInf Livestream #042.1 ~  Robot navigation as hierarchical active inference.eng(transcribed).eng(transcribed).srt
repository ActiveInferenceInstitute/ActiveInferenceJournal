1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
some questions that we had from the dot

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,799
zero but also new questions arising

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,640
so we'll just start with an introduction

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
and saying hello and then it'll be

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
awesome to hear the author's initial

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
contextualization so i'm daniel i'm a

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,400
researcher in california and as explored

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
a little bit in the dot zero with sid

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
there's a few places that we were super

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
curious about ranging from how does one

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,279
go from a phenomena that they want to

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,199
model like navigation to the analytical

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,360
equations and how is that related to

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
active inference in the free energy

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
principle and then how do we go from

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
that analytical formulation

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
to the actual gigabyte of video data and

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,399
the real-time sensing and actions so a

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
lot of exciting topics and i'll pass to

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
blue

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
hi i'm blue i'm a researcher in new

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
mexico and um this paper was kind of way

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,520
over my head

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,199
for a lot of reasons it's just so far

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,280
out of what i normally do

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
but i have some questions related to the

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
hierarchical modeling and how that is

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
kind of used and

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
how that can be related or cannot be

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,200
related to maybe biological systems that

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
model in a hierarchical way similarly um

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
and i'll pass it off to adam i guess if

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
you want to start or introduce yourself

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
and and you guys can take it away

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
uh hi i'm adam i'm a systems

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
neuroscientist who's

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
uh currently a research fellow at the

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,960
johns hopkins center for psychedelic and

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
consciousness research

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
um

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
i've been collaborating with tim and

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
ozin and others on

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
trying to

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
understand the natures of navigation

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
and

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
the nature and the ways in which the

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
hippocampal and enter rhino system might

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
be relevant

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
and the ways in which this could be used

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
as a means of understanding

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,479
um

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,159
thought more generally

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
and it's been uh

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
awesome and slightly intimidating except

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
tim is awesome so that's made it less

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,399
intimidating

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
so that brings it to me so i'm tim um

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
i'm a computer scientist roboticist at

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
kent university

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
and we haven't subscribed to the active

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,239
entrance formalism to

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,000
try to make our robot

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,760
slightly more intelligent um

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
this paper was i think one of our

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,879
major accomplishments last year into the

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
collaboration with

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
adam where we basically

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
look at the problem from

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
of navigation from from different angles

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
ranging from

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,599
active inference modeling

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
to an actual implementation

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
on a real robot

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,879
and at the same time looking at

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,920
how

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
could this work in in an actual brain or

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
or what other

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,440
relations uh and the synergies there so

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
it's really exciting uh

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
to have this paper out but also this was

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
just as getting started i'd say it was

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,840
it was basically our first

83
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,760
um artifacts that we

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
published we have another one

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
together with adam in the works

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
um and yeah

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
i'm pretty sure that we will continue

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
this endeavor for for quite some time

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,760
london so we're all just only just

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
getting started so

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
uh that being said but

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
probably a lot of the questions are also

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,159
still questions for us

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
so we'll see uh to what extent we can

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
give give an answer as of today already

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
awesome well we can

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,879
start with this sort of

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
triad that is

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
highlighted in the paper

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
and adam you said it as understanding

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
the basis of navigation and we have

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
these three legs to the stool kind of

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
three threads that intertwine in the

104
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
paper with it analytical

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
formulation of navigation which is what

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
blue mentioned with a hierarchical

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,680
generative model

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
and the implementation in robotic and in

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
biological

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,358
systems so maybe a first question is

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
how has this

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
intersection

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
of modeling navigation with robotics and

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,639
biology been conceptualized and what

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
brought you to apply active inference in

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,919
this way and what does it add

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,220
we should go first

118
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,259
[Music]

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
so

120
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,840
so maybe my my perspective here is that

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,479
um

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
we basically got started from um

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
from a robotics perspective like looking

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
at

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
the the navigation problem and looking

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
at the

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
ways that it's being solved

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
right now

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
and implemented right now

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
and at the same time we already had

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
quite some experience with active

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
inference but more like

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
on yeah

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
simpler problems let's say or first

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
or first experiments were more on this

136
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,639
kind of

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,240
mountain core

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
environment or simulated car racer but

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
it was always our goal to kind of try to

140
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,759
scale it up to

141
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
yeah to real-world robots

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
and so

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
we got started by

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
drawing and seeing barrels between

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
current implementations out there

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
that seem to match with with how we

147
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
would look at it from an active

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
inference perspective

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,639
and

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
kind of work our way from both ways so

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,479
on the one lens try to get some

152
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,800
implementation running and on the other

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
hand

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,199
seeing how we could

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,759
formalize it and and actually make the

156
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
mouth work in the active inference

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
framework

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,880
and

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
what we found out was that actually the

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
the best matching um

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
implementation from a robotics

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
perspective was actually one that was

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
quite bio-inspired so it was basically

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,479
the the red flag model from milford at

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,280
all

166
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
where they had these

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
uh heavy inspiration from grid cells

168
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
place cells and these things

169
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
and yeah of course uh

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
it was not really a surprise given the

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
the fact how active entrance is also

172
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
grounded in in neuroscience and so

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
that's where we reached out to to

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,479
um

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
to basically show off like okay

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
this is our trajectory uh this is our

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
plan this is our current implementation

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,840
and how we think the math could work

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,160
um and then adam

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
with his infinite knowledge on

181
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
how the the the

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
the

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
it could work in the brain he gave like

184
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
all kind of pointers like okay but this

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,440
is interesting because what you

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
implemented here is actually

187
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,199
looking a lot a lot like this kind of

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,960
system and what you're doing here is

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
actually

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
very much like these kind of things and

191
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,000
then we just said okay let's let's dig

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
into this further and

193
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,199
and we basically uh started on curving

194
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,080
out

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,599
um

196
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,080
ping-ponging like okay if this is how

197
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
it's done in the brain and maybe we can

198
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,840
make something more similar in in the

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
mouth or in the implementation vice

200
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
versa

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
and

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
the paper is basically a first step

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,080
where we had like

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
the three bits kind of in place but we

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
know where the open issues are

206
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
but it actually has something working on

207
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
on an and sensible on all three uh

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
levels i'd say uh and that's that's

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
that's where we we

210
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,000
we are at

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
at this moment

212
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
awesome thank you adam anything you um

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
add to that

214
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,720
i guess what i would add is um

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,759
i'm

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
increasingly uh

217
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
compelled by the idea that

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
um

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
robotics as a touchstone and basis for

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
understanding different aspects of mind

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,559
is

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,719
like it might be the most powerful kind

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
of um

224
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
grounded empiricism we can do

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
and i i think it's both because it's

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
like the like a lot of times like that

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
feminine quote of like what i cannot

228
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,839
build i cannot understand is like

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
mentioned but this is actually building

230
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
systems that yeah this is

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
that that have to work and um and

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
that these problems

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,399
like in going through them and looking

234
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
at the different solutions

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
like the kind of understanding you get i

236
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,720
think is really uh unique

237
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,440
but also i think it's particularly apt

238
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
because

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
of what our minds other than controls

240
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
cybernetic control systems for

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,560
bodies that have to move through the

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
world

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,760
and so this idea that like the way

244
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
roboticists are approaching it like

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
it's

246
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,440
and

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
that is

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
the exact problem that nature had to

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
solve but natural selection had to solve

250
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
now the question is was it the same it

251
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
might be in some cases because you'd

252
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
expect you know um within you know

253
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
bounds

254
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
uh

255
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
nature to be a fairly clever uh blind

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
designer um

257
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
in terms of what it might discover and

258
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
so

259
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
just this going back and forth between

260
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
the the robotics perspective

261
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
and the how it might work in biology and

262
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
then this abstract ways that they're um

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
the abstract algorithmic implementations

264
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
of them for the robots

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
and seeing how those can mutually inform

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
each other it's

267
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,600
i mean for me it's uh

268
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
this is how i basically want like all my

269
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
thinking about the mind to be from now

270
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,880
on like i feel like this is just like

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
this is how it has to this is the most

272
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
powerful way of thinking on it

273
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
that back and forth

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,000
let's enter in the biological door or

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
blue do you have a question

276
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,800
okay

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,680
so

278
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,640
adam

279
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
what

280
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
even though of course it's a deep area

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
and there's writing in the paper and

282
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
citations and so on

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
what is so interesting about the

284
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,839
structuring of the grid cells through

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,279
space and time

286
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,839
and what can we learn from that about

287
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,800
effective ways of navigating

288
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
so

289
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
in in leighton slam um

290
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
we have these pose cells and actually i

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
think um

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
probably better for tim to talk about

293
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
that like the exact ways in which these

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
cells function within the robotic system

295
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
i think that actually brings more

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,279
clarity

297
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,120
than um the more mysterious like so

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
there's lots of ideas been going around

299
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
like computational neuroscience of like

300
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,160
what the grid cells might do

301
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,519
but i actually think the greatest

302
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,360
clarity comes from like well how would

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
the analogs work in the robotic system

304
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
so i'm going to kick that to tim uh what

305
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,920
do you think tim

306
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
yeah so i

307
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,120
i think that in

308
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,279
in our current implementation

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,639
the

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
the parallel with grid soles is kind of

311
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,839
um

312
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,639
um

313
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
part wired in the implementation it's

314
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,440
kind of

315
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
this by design you have something that

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,279
looks

317
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,000
if you squint your eyes a lot

318
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
it looks a bit like grip so i i wouldn't

319
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
say that we actually have

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
um grid cells in here

321
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,880
um

322
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
because to me the grid stuff is

323
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
basically

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
it should be an abstract

325
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
it should be

326
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,200
um giving you a way of

327
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,920
modeling movement in an abstract space

328
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,959
basically

329
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,680
and in the case of navigation

330
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,800
the space

331
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
by accident maps to the real world

332
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
and

333
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,600
the grid selectivation is just a a

334
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
peculiar way of

335
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
encoding

336
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
where you are in space

337
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,720
without um

338
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
without just giving you the x y

339
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,480
coordinates basically

340
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
with a more kind of

341
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,279
um

342
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,320
uh

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
higher dimensional

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
more robust representation of

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
where are you on in this on this grid

346
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
and how do you if i now move

347
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
how does how does your

348
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,160
location in in

349
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,480
in this reference frame or this

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
uh change

351
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
and so in our in our implementation we

352
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
basically just said okay we know that we

353
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,519
are in a

354
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
roughly flat uh surface world

355
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,240
so

356
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
the main coordinates that we need to

357
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
track and integrate over are the x

358
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
x y position and um

359
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
the head direction these are basically

360
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
the the main things

361
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
and then we we

362
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
use this thing called the continuous

363
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
director network to kind of

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
represent

365
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
these three coordinates

366
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,279
and

367
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,560
we basically

368
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
um um

369
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
we inject the knowledge that if you move

370
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
forward then

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
um

372
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
you will also move forward within this

373
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
uh

374
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,959
attractor network uh

375
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,239
location and

376
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,959
roughly this this corresponds to doing

377
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,360
kind of bulk integration and i'm pretty

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
sure that grid cells are um

379
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,160
giving you similar functionality um in

380
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
the brain that i would not say that our

381
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,079
current implementation actually has grid

382
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
tools i think the parallel is more

383
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
with place cells

384
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,760
because there we do have kind of we do

385
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,680
learn

386
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,720
representations from

387
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
visual sensory inputs

388
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
that kind of

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
give you an an

390
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
estimate of

391
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
this is a particular location

392
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
and if you see a similar pattern

393
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,279
then

394
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,120
it is likely that you are visiting the

395
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
same location again

396
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
and it

397
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,639
at the same time you happen to have a

398
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
very similar

399
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,320
x y uh and head direction as in your uh

400
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,959
as in your previous time you you you

401
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,760
kind of saw something still like that

402
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
then you have pretty good evidence that

403
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
you are actually in the same

404
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,680
spot and then uh this is what you then

405
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,639
call a loop closure and then you kind of

406
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
reorient yourself

407
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,519
as if you were at the same location so

408
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,279
that's kind of how

409
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
i would uh

410
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,959
think of uh

411
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
grid cells and place cells in in our

412
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,079
current in our current work

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
thank you blue do you have any

414
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
questions yes please go for it

415
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
so i'm i'm curious as to um

416
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
the role if any or how the system may

417
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
change um if you included proprio

418
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
reception which is like

419
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
the sense of where your

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
body is in space and so like this is

421
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
partially modeled through the visual

422
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,680
system um at place cells grid cells etc

423
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
but it's it's not always right so it

424
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
includes other senses like balance and

425
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,839
you know where is my hand and these

426
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
kinds of things um and i'm just curious

427
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
if your model

428
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,360
includes that in any way or um only

429
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
or or not or how it may change if it did

430
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
um give it kind of like a more embodied

431
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
um

432
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,399
yeah so so basically uh in our case the

433
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,399
proprioception is limited to

434
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
um

435
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,279
basically the the

436
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
the velocity commands that you that you

437
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,480
issue to the to the robot it also

438
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
observes these again so it assumes that

439
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
it knows which command sending and then

440
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
these are also kind of

441
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
fed back to the model as kind of a

442
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,040
sensor so if you say drive forward or

443
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
turn left or turn right with these kind

444
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
of angular velocities this information

445
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
is also sent

446
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,839
into the model and this is then what we

447
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,320
call the action so everywhere in the

448
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
especially in the low level model you

449
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,720
see the action pop-up this is basically

450
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
you can you can see this as kind of a

451
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,800
proprioception uh

452
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
thing and so everything

453
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,199
kind of predicts

454
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,640
what will happen

455
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,599
given um given what i

456
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,559
i sensed that i was doing basically

457
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,520
um

458
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,319
and we do it both for the for the visual

459
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
sensor like what would i see if i if i'm

460
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
turning left or right or go forward

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,599
but also for

462
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
tracking the the pose and doing the

463
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
pattern integration like if i move

464
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,720
forward and my heading was a zero angle

465
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
then i will probably just move forward

466
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,919
in the x direction of the of the

467
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
um

468
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
and that introduction of counter

469
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
factuals and anticipation what would

470
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
happen if i did this

471
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
is very interesting area and uh

472
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
also it it

473
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,480
speaks to the composability and the

474
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
flexibility of the active inference

475
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
model like sid highlighted that only the

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
visual data were being used here with

477
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
the rgb

478
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
values of video but there are other

479
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
kinds of sensors

480
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
that could be

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
used as another sense state and that

482
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,679
would kind of increase the

483
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
dimensionality of the model maybe it is

484
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
a value add maybe it's not but it

485
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
doesn't require um re-writing it's like

486
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
more like plugging in a different hard

487
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
drive than it is like having a different

488
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,720
computer

489
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
um

490
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
so

491
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
you mentioned a higher dimensional

492
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
robust representation of location

493
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,240
and that's definitely one of the

494
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,960
advantages and and aspects of the model

495
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
that'll be important to

496
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
explore more like in the dot zero we

497
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
explored this paper are we ready for

498
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
service robots

499
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
that showed how sometimes even trivial

500
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,720
changes to environments can result in

501
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
the robot getting lost because it has

502
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,880
referenced to something like a chair

503
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,679
that's no longer at the same location

504
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,120
so

505
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
how

506
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
does this model

507
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
provide a higher dimensional robust

508
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,960
representation of location

509
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,000
and

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
how did you go from thinking about that

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,799
to the actual way that the

512
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
generative model is framed

513
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
that's the first question and then the

514
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
second part is going to be about how do

515
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
you go from the framing to the actual

516
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,799
computational implementation but just

517
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,039
the first stage of this pipeline how do

518
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,320
we go from um wishing upon a star that

519
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
we could have biologically inspired

520
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,240
resilient navigation

521
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
to writing down the formalisms as you

522
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,720
had them

523
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
yeah so

524
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
to get back at yours at your first

525
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
at the problems that you

526
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
that you mentioned on the

527
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,520
on the service robot like so basically

528
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,600
the the major problem in in robotic slam

529
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
is that

530
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
indeed if your environment changes uh

531
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,720
slightly a bit then

532
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
then

533
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
the same location doesn't look the same

534
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
anymore in whatever sensor modality

535
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
you're using and

536
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
that can be problematic especially if

537
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
you if you want to model

538
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
the uh the environment as like a metric

539
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,760
system where you basically

540
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,799
um

541
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,600
define this is my origin so this is zero

542
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
zero in the coordinate system and now i

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
will

544
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,080
for every obstacle or

545
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,799
thing that i approach i will log my

546
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,360
estimation of the x y coordinates

547
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
and and then suddenly when your chair

548
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
moves of course yeah it

549
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,919
everything breaks

550
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
but here and in in this system

551
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
we actually

552
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
get rid of

553
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,960
being grounded in in in the metric space

554
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
the only thing that matters is that

555
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
this location looks very similar to

556
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,799
something uh i i visited before and it

557
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
also seems likely given the the pet

558
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
integrated um

559
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
trajectory i i assume i was following so

560
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
this might be the same spot

561
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,280
and if you think that or if the chair

562
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
moved

563
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,360
in in that place

564
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
yeah that's fine then you just say okay

565
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
maybe it's a different spot it doesn't

566
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
really matter

567
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
um

568
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
um

569
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
at some point

570
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,679
you will have a kind of a queue that is

571
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,600
stable right so and that's actually what

572
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
we also do as as humans if you want to

573
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
navigate you just look for the the the

574
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,559
queues that you are that you know that

575
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
are pretty stable if you visit a new

576
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
town you will look for the church tower

577
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
because you know it will not move you

578
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,000
will not

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
orient yourself based on the core of the

580
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
cars that are parked

581
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,640
somewhere so

582
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
i think

583
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
by by

584
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
using the active entrance

585
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
principle as as

586
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,480
as like a starting point

587
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
you can you can get rid of all

588
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
a lot of these these problems because

589
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
your agent will automatically

590
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,919
um

591
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,960
look for these stable cues and if

592
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
suddenly the environment changes but

593
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
just accept this and just model it as

594
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
like okay i i

595
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
i think i i'm revisiting this same

596
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
trajectory but now it looks different so

597
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
maybe i just have to model it as such as

598
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
this is kind of a trajectory that can

599
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
change often and maybe this implied

600
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,120
that

601
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,320
if you plan the next time you'd rather

602
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
prefer a different trajectory where you

603
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
know that everything is stable right so

604
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
this is the

605
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
the the same as as reducing your your

606
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,840
ambiguity so i i think that getting rid

607
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,039
of

608
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,520
everything should be structured in this

609
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
x y location

610
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
in the metric space and else i don't

611
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
know what's going on just by getting rid

612
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
of that and and

613
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,799
just assume anything can happen anything

614
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,200
can change and if it does not change i i

615
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
prefer it i like it better

616
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
this helps a lot

617
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
to circumvent a lot of the traditional

618
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,559
problems i've seen

619
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
cool

620
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,760
adam anything to add on that

621
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
i mean so one of the things um

622
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,360
that we've been working on is so

623
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,280
like in this paper it's like it's trying

624
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,520
to say like okay so to what degree

625
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
um

626
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,760
are the principles of what we understand

627
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,520
about like the natures of like the

628
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
hippocampal enter rhino system being

629
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
reflected in this simultaneous

630
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
localization and mapping problem in

631
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,799
latent slam

632
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
um and

633
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,480
some of the other work we're doing is

634
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
also going in the reverse direction

635
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
of um

636
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
you know what can these

637
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
principles

638
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
of these slam principles use for

639
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
autonomous navigation

640
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,279
what can they tell us about uh the brain

641
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,760
functioning as a cybernetic system and

642
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,880
so

643
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
one idea in general is that

644
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,760
um each of these operations in addition

645
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,679
to having this

646
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,120
fundamental significance of the of the

647
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,559
basics of being able to move through the

648
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,039
world this you know um

649
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,080
uh

650
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
tasks that any you know active

651
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,640
inferential system that's uh

652
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
going to survive and repeat and

653
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,240
do what it needs to do has to handle but

654
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,440
um

655
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
to what extent

656
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
were these same principles repurposed

657
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,559
for

658
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,279
sophisticated inference more generally

659
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,600
and they're actually and

660
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
to what degree is sophisticated

661
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
inference structured according to uh

662
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
slam principles

663
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
and so

664
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
um

665
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,279
so like

666
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,400
if you're talking about these like loop

667
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,919
closure events like this finding this

668
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
highly familiar

669
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
state and where you you think you know

670
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,480
where you are by this

671
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
convergence of like your trajectory

672
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
information and your pose

673
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
well this question would be like

674
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,960
um is this a model potentially for

675
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
the feeling of insight

676
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
or uh discovering of like um

677
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
causal accounts

678
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,480
um is this uh

679
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
and is this actually a inter and intra

680
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,440
individual source of inter individual

681
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,559
differences

682
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,320
which would be uh fairly fundamental

683
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
like how familiar do you think things

684
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,600
are or not

685
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
um

686
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
how much do you update on accounting or

687
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
encountering these highly familiar

688
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,440
situations and so like um

689
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,799
so me personally what i've been

690
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,840
wondering is

691
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,440
so to what a sense like of all the

692
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
details um so towards degree

693
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
so re-representing the biological

694
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
details in terms of the kinds of

695
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
descriptions that

696
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
tim is giving here

697
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
and also though thinking of

698
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,880
cognition more generally as navigation

699
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,400
and so thinking of like each of these

700
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,039
things what are the analogs at the level

701
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
of thought

702
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,720
as a kind of navigation through

703
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,520
generalized space

704
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
wow awesome

705
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
navigation

706
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,640
a lot of interesting work on exploration

707
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
exploitation in mind and space hills at

708
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,200
all 2015 and on thinking about

709
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
planning and the evolution of planning

710
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,360
as being related to spatial as well as

711
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,279
cognitive foraging it's blue

712
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,360
so it's interesting to think about

713
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,880
cognition as um navigation

714
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
like i think about the feeling that i

715
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
have when i'm like searching for

716
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
a thought a word a name of a person like

717
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
it literally feels like a

718
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
like you're scrolling through a filing

719
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,000
cabinet like physically looking for

720
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
this like piece of information in your

721
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
brain and i know that like

722
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,360
different neurons like store different

723
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
pieces of information like the jennifer

724
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
aniston neuron and and these kinds of

725
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,000
things

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,559
so i wonder what um

727
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,000
can you just elaborate maybe a little

728
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
bit more on that adam about like

729
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,000
cognition as navigation is it like

730
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
literally navigating to find the right

731
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
like neuron that goes ding ding ding

732
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,480
ding ding that's the one i wanted

733
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,399
so like

734
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,480
to subject three it could be and that

735
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,679
like

736
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,200
it's like two ways i might think of it

737
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,919
as one um like you were talking earl um

738
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,120
before and you really bring up like

739
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,640
memory palaces

740
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
and i think that'll be like one example

741
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,559
of thought as navigation navigation

742
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,919
which is like with this like art of

743
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,039
memory

744
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,880
in terms of like it can be like part of

745
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,919
the way we

746
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,960
um

747
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
access and organize

748
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
the information we work with when we're

749
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,760
thinking

750
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
is through a kind of spatialization

751
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
often and actually like to the extent

752
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
that we show like really great

753
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
virtuosity with memory it's through an

754
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,960
explicit process of spatializing and

755
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,559
navigating through domain

756
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,200
and that gives us like the best purchase

757
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
we have on um

758
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,279
you know remembering these building

759
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,440
constructing and accessing these complex

760
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
structures

761
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,159
uh but in terms of what you're

762
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,679
describing with like something kind of

763
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,399
like you know jennifer anderson or like

764
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
uh neurons are like kind of

765
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
finding uh

766
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,520
uh

767
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
the things coming to mind there's like

768
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,799
foraging theory and so it's what you

769
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,480
might be foraging for like when you're

770
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
like looking for like uh something that

771
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,520
fits it is it's a certain amount of like

772
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,960
familiarity or like some amount of like

773
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
you know it could take different forms

774
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,440
like you know some sort of uh yeah

775
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
maybe maybe it's a enteroceptive code

776
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
and it's like like a visceral feeling of

777
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,799
like

778
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,640
compelling this or maybe it's like a

779
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,399
more like a proprioceptive code and it's

780
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
like tension in the body i i don't know

781
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
what it might be but this like you're

782
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,080
you're there's some sort of

783
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
read you're having

784
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
and

785
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
are you finding what you're looking for

786
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
and so then the idea would be like

787
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,080
you're foraging for it and so you might

788
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
spend a little bit of time

789
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,559
in

790
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,279
some area of conceptual space and you're

791
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
kind of moving around in there like

792
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
trying out different permutations

793
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
and then you're like nah i'm not finding

794
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
it and then you might do like a

795
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
different tech and then move to another

796
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,559
area of semantic or conceptual space and

797
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,919
you're searching around there and so

798
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
like in forging theory these would be

799
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,880
called um i believe levy flights and so

800
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,919
there's like something called the

801
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,000
marginal value theorem which is like if

802
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
you're trying to be an optimal forager

803
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
um

804
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
you're trying to like balance expiration

805
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
exploitation and so you don't want to

806
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,799
spend too long in a given like patch

807
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,159
if it's not having what you want but you

808
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,520
you don't want to leave a patch

809
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
prematurely if it's a good patch to be

810
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
exploited and so the idea is like if

811
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,960
you're looking for like

812
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,559
searching for a name or something that

813
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,279
fits it might take the form of this kind

814
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
of like generalized foraging but instead

815
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,240
of

816
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
you like locomoting through spaces

817
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
you're actually spending different

818
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,799
amounts of time in semantic spaces and

819
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,240
then shifting

820
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,600
based on whether you think you're

821
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,960
actually it's like a a juicy patch

822
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,159
and so like with the marginal value

823
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,679
theorem it says like if your current

824
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,200
rate of foraging drops below the

825
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,799
historical return

826
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,720
then you should um

827
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
then you should go um

828
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
and so this like there might be

829
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
different like inductive biases in the

830
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
brain that would represent this like

831
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,679
from like the campbell system this might

832
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,919
look like for instance like um

833
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,000
uh the way-by-planet is like you might

834
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,559
get like this um

835
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,159
friction error drops below a certain

836
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,200
amount

837
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
um or goes past a certain amount and

838
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
then the hippocampal system like ramps

839
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
up with a lot of her current activity

840
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
it's called like a ripple

841
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
and then it resets itself and like

842
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
re-tiles the space and like

843
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
stimulates cortex like a new like

844
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
set of operative policies and

845
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,320
spatializations

846
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,520
might occur

847
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,559
and so like this would be like an

848
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,240
example like a mechanism like the

849
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,120
capital system might have like a

850
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,039
built-in mechanism for like these like

851
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
attentional shifts and shifts and these

852
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,240
imaginative shifts when you're doing

853
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,320
foraging it might be reflected also in

854
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,640
like other ways like uh like dopamine so

855
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,080
there's like some thoughts um i think

856
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
that like nathaniel dahl will talk about

857
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,320
like

858
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,840
one way of interpreting opponency

859
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
between like phasic and tonic dopamine

860
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,720
would be like the tonic would tell you

861
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,080
like what's your average return

862
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,279
basically

863
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,480
and there seems to be like a kind of

864
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
functional i don't know if it's not

865
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,240
antagonism but like the more your tonic

866
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,360
is high

867
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,279
the more you're uh

868
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,000
the less impactful any phasic event is

869
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
and so it would be kind of like um

870
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,840
if you're

871
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
foraging like what would occasionally

872
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,039
shift or not

873
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
um you might actually see this like

874
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,399
playing out like in the way

875
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,080
neuromodulators work

876
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,200
and so

877
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
i don't know if that like helps a lot

878
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
but the idea is like this is the sort of

879
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,360
like

880
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
um thinking in terms of forging or

881
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,919
navigation through generalized spaces

882
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
as basically being

883
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,880
um

884
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
so the reason like you know so i guess

885
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,679
there's like a kind of like uh priory

886
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
reason like you would expect it to be

887
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,720
um

888
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,159
generally good which is well doesn't

889
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,200
everything

890
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
like

891
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
and most of the things we encounter do

892
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
indeed exist in spaces and then most

893
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,200
things the way we understand them is by

894
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,720
like spatializing them it's like we

895
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
graph them we

896
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
do like multi-dimensional scaling we do

897
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,440
different things to try to like

898
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,279
it's just like a way we understand

899
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,240
things

900
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
but it also seems like this was probably

901
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,640
both evolutionarily and developmentally

902
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,360
like

903
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,120
this was the original challenge that had

904
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
to be solved

905
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
where the systems were paying their

906
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,720
weight

907
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,640
and that this would then involve like a

908
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
repurposing and a redeploying for

909
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,760
more abstract domains

910
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
um so like there's some other like um i

911
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,159
think it's burgess um

912
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,279
has done some good work we're like

913
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,880
finding like for instance like

914
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
we might create like a morpho space and

915
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,120
we're like looking like um like they'll

916
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,360
create like these generative like birds

917
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,799
with like different like neck lengths

918
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,679
and you're trying to do like categories

919
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,120
over like what the different kinds of

920
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,159
birds are

921
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,840
and there's like there's evidence that

922
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
the way we do the categorization is

923
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,039
we'll create

924
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,000
a

925
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
a spatialization of this task structure

926
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,480
and

927
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
there's some evidence of the hippocampus

928
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
system is we're navigating through that

929
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,320
and dealing with these categories

930
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
um i know so that's that was a lot of

931
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,080
rambling but like

932
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,360
i don't know if that

933
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
god would

934
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,919
any of that land or yeah lots of it

935
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,440
landed it was very cool thank you okay

936
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
one note that we'll i'm sure be

937
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,919
exploring going forward optimal foraging

938
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
theory is often put in the context of

939
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,360
utility

940
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,720
which is just the pragmatic component in

941
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,399
active inference in terms of policy

942
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,200
selection so optimal active inference

943
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,399
foraging is like when the epistemic and

944
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,039
the pragmatic gain are being considered

945
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,559
so that's quite interesting and then

946
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,960
also there's as you brought up

947
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,399
individual and collective navigation

948
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,279
so one case is sort of the sovereign

949
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,320
robot

950
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,679
no wi-fi onboard computation alone in

951
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,880
the warehouse

952
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
but then in the case of for example an

953
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,679
ant colony where there's stigmargy and

954
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,079
modification of the environment

955
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,520
that might

956
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
be possible or even facilitated by

957
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
different onboard cognition and

958
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,320
different outsourced or offloaded which

959
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,800
brings us to extended cognitive

960
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
discussions but let's return to this

961
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,839
question about going from

962
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,040
this resiliency of navigation that

963
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,639
a biologist

964
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,440
knows exists a roboticist might want to

965
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,480
see

966
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
how did you then go to that third space

967
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
and actually

968
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,040
have a hierarchical model so here in

969
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,399
figure 2 um or wherever else you suggest

970
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,480
what is happening here and how did this

971
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
graphical structure come to be as

972
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
opposed to potentially like other

973
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
graphical structures that could have

974
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,359
been used

975
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
okay so

976
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
basically um

977
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,440
let me first maybe explain what all the

978
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,839
variables mean in this in this figure

979
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,480
so

980
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,440
going from the bottom uh to up at the

981
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
bottom you have the o's ots

982
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,240
which are basically observations so

983
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,960
these are like the visual inputs what do

984
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,560
you what the robot sees basically

985
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,040
and then we have two

986
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,920
latent variables s and p

987
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,240
where s is basically um an estimation of

988
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
um

989
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,440
all the latent vectors that give rise to

990
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
the observation so this is it's kind of

991
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
a latent space that that that confines

992
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,320
all possible visual observations

993
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,520
and uh p on the other hand is a latent

994
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
variable that

995
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,480
has a representation of of your pose

996
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,079
which is then basically

997
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,440
um

998
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
in in this case

999
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
um your

1000
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,680
your xy position and the head direction

1001
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,359
and then we go

1002
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,160
we have one more which is the aid action

1003
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,220
and so that's what i i hinted at

1004
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,000
[Music]

1005
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,640
previously this is basically your

1006
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,119
your proprioception you know

1007
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,359
you know what you have been doing uh so

1008
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,520
there therefore up until uh the past

1009
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,000
the the eighties are also shaded so it

1010
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
means that you you basically have access

1011
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,720
to

1012
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,520
uh

1013
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,119
what you have been doing it's like the

1014
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,000
low level action like move forward to

1015
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,320
this philosophy or turn left or right

1016
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,400
but then for the future this becomes an

1017
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
unobserved thing and you basically want

1018
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
to infer

1019
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
potential actions you should be doing in

1020
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
in the future

1021
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
and then

1022
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,280
for the future uh a a number of actions

1023
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
can be just uh

1024
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,440
summarized as pi which is then the

1025
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,079
policy so the policy is no more than a

1026
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,480
sequence of future actions that you that

1027
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
you uh that you want to do or that you

1028
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
intend to do

1029
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
and then we move up a level in hierarchy

1030
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,400
and there

1031
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,079
we have uh two more variables one is uh

1032
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,240
the location l

1033
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,400
and this is then basically kind of a

1034
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,040
more coarse-grained um

1035
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,280
um

1036
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
yeah

1037
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,440
representation of location where am i

1038
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,599
but it's not really uh it's not

1039
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,440
necessarily tied to

1040
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,960
a metric space it's just like

1041
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,760
identifying this is a location

1042
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
and then

1043
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,400
we have uh also an action space at this

1044
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,839
level but this is the more uh uh we call

1045
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,760
this moves or m

1046
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
and the move is basically kind of um

1047
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
moving from one location to another so

1048
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,240
locations can just be more coarse grains

1049
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,440
like

1050
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
what you uh

1051
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
what you define as like a separate

1052
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,400
location in in your environment

1053
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,760
uh whereas at the lower level the the

1054
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,920
the states if you move from one state to

1055
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
the other it's basically just saying

1056
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,720
okay

1057
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
what would be the next frame of my

1058
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,880
camera sensor would be like and so it's

1059
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,720
also crucial to know that these two

1060
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,200
levels operate on different kind of time

1061
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
scales so the the lowest level time

1062
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
scale is basically a very fine

1063
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,320
fine grained um action perception loop i

1064
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,119
i send the motor commands to the robot

1065
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,920
and i read out my camera and this can go

1066
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
to um

1067
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,440
i think we implemented it at like 10

1068
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
hertz so 10 times per second we get a

1069
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,599
new camera frame we finally updated the

1070
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,960
motor command

1071
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
whereas the location is just like um

1072
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,000
moving from one location to another can

1073
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,920
can take you maybe 10 or or or more time

1074
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
steps at the lower level

1075
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
and then of course one of the crucial

1076
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,079
bits is then

1077
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,400
when when do you

1078
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
how do you then how do you identify a

1079
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,480
location

1080
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,079
and so basically how

1081
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,560
how it comes to be is that if you you

1082
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,839
you you basically observe your uh

1083
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,480
your space through the camera images we

1084
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,920
infer this abstract state space s and

1085
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
then we look at what what is the

1086
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,119
surprise

1087
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:31,839
of

1088
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,800
being in this state versus uh what i

1089
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,760
predicted and if this surpasses like a

1090
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,359
certain threshold

1091
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,640
um so

1092
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
uh yeah it's so this is uh

1093
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
it's pretty complex to explain but i'll

1094
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,599
do my best so so every time every time

1095
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,240
step you get basically a new camera

1096
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,520
image and you can calculate like what is

1097
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,920
what is the kl divergence between what i

1098
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,640
was thinking about the state previously

1099
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,599
and how does it that how did it shift

1100
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,839
with my new observations and basically

1101
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
your kind of the bayesian surprise that

1102
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,480
you had

1103
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,960
from seeing this observation and every

1104
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,079
time step we accumulate like this number

1105
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,880
and once we surpass a certain threshold

1106
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,720
which is kind of a hyper parameter we

1107
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
just fix it that's something that seems

1108
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
to work so if you surprise this

1109
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,560
threshold you basically say okay

1110
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,040
this is now distinct enough from end

1111
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
time steps before

1112
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
so it must be something new it must be a

1113
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640
new kind of

1114
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,599
location in my neck and then you add

1115
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,400
this

1116
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
thing as a distant distinct location in

1117
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,520
your map and you add like a link from

1118
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,920
the previous location to this one and

1119
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,240
you start and then you continue further

1120
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,160
on building the map

1121
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,319
and this is how you then kind of create

1122
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,240
this more coarse grained um

1123
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,000
map of your environment

1124
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and um

1125
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,280
and you can then um reason like how

1126
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
should i move from this location to

1127
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,440
another and you then can you can

1128
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,400
basically use your

1129
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
your previously visit locations and and

1130
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
moves to kind of i have a model of

1131
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
how can i move in this space but at the

1132
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,839
more of course great level moving from

1133
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,200
one uh location to another and it also

1134
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,280
means that by by using this surprise on

1135
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
infertility in space that that we infer

1136
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,400
from from visual input

1137
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
it means that it it's not not every edge

1138
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,800
has the same distance in real space

1139
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,040
necessarily so if you're if you're the

1140
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,800
robot is traversing

1141
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,160
a white hallway where the the the the

1142
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,319
walls are perfectly white and everything

1143
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,400
that everything's the same

1144
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
then it will take a long time for this

1145
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,839
threshold to be reached and it will only

1146
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,800
at

1147
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,280
uh larger distances make a new node

1148
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,960
because everything looks the same anyway

1149
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,119
so there's no extra information that i

1150
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,839
need to put in the map but if you then

1151
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
suddenly

1152
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,720
see a door for example then you suddenly

1153
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,640
reach your threshold and you add a new

1154
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,280
location in your map and so it's

1155
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,359
basically the locations in the map are

1156
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,000
basically defined of uh on

1157
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
what is the information i got by looking

1158
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
at this thing rather than um how much

1159
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,599
meters did i traverse uh in in this in

1160
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,640
this time and it makes it a really

1161
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,119
interesting way of of representing maps

1162
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,960
because it's more like how much

1163
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
information uh

1164
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,359
is there in this particular location

1165
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
rather than uh

1166
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,640
which xy locat position is is here

1167
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,560
does it make sense

1168
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,079
yeah

1169
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,119
and

1170
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
it feels to map onto the distinction

1171
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
between like kronos and kairos

1172
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,599
like in this analogy here kronos is the

1173
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,160
the chronometer it's the watch time it's

1174
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,640
the geometry it's the xy grid it's one

1175
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,280
meter and then kairos is like the

1176
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,040
timeliness of action and the time it

1177
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
takes to complete an action

1178
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,920
and then something being like boring

1179
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,640
that's going through a low information

1180
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
hallway

1181
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,920
in the cognitive foraging it's like are

1182
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,400
we there yet driving through this

1183
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
featureless landscape where the salience

1184
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,040
is low because my predictions are

1185
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,480
basically being

1186
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,280
um met almost too well

1187
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,000
and there's a lot of other

1188
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,160
ways to go with it um

1189
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,079
adam anything to add and also again i'm

1190
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,000
just kind of curious like what is the

1191
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,160
space of the possible graphical

1192
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,960
structures do you think that this is the

1193
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,040
only or the sort of

1194
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,960
grandfather graphical model for

1195
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
hierarchical navigation like how do we

1196
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,839
go from imagining this tactics and

1197
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,280
strategy multi-level model to a

1198
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,040
graphical model that we believe will be

1199
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,480
consistent with active inference and

1200
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,760
amenable to message passing

1201
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
and maybe

1202
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,640
to add on on this last question um

1203
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
i think kristen has a

1204
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,880
has a paper on deep temporal

1205
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,440
article models where he basically lays

1206
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,920
out more generic so like the if you're

1207
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,760
looking at the ultimate generic

1208
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,400
hierarchical model you'll find it there

1209
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
where it's basically just an aggregation

1210
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,520
of

1211
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,560
states

1212
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,079
that give rise to observations

1213
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,079
that

1214
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,240
go from one state to another given an

1215
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,200
option

1216
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
and then you can add that level on top

1217
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,960
and level on top and you can keep on

1218
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,359
adding levels

1219
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,440
and that's kind of the prototypical

1220
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,319
hierarchical model i would say um

1221
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,480
and what you see here is kind of

1222
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,520
particular instantiation where we

1223
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,760
took um some uh domain knowledge like

1224
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,079
okay for navigation what would be

1225
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,560
sensible levels to think about and what

1226
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,760
would these uh latent states then what

1227
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
should they represent and then of course

1228
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,119
uh

1229
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,520
you easily end up like okay

1230
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
at the lowest level i i need to have

1231
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,240
some state that represents my camera

1232
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,359
images and at the higher level uh i want

1233
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,400
to have some locations in the map um

1234
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,359
and

1235
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,680
how do they then relate okay i i

1236
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,160
probably also want to have this the spot

1237
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,800
integration so maybe i i need to have a

1238
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,359
special

1239
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,599
special first class citizens here in in

1240
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,760
the form of my pose

1241
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,839
and that's how you basically build up

1242
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,240
the model from first looking at this

1243
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,480
prototypical hierarchical model

1244
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,440
then looking at yeah but in my case what

1245
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,319
do i think is sensible what could these

1246
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,520
things mean

1247
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,079
and then try to figure out like okay

1248
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,160
um

1249
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,400
at this at this stage we kind of

1250
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,040
converge on the one hand from

1251
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,599
top down like does the math work out to

1252
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,079
bottom up does this match match with my

1253
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,319
implementation and then at some point we

1254
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,079
converge to this basically

1255
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,319
so the high road and the low road they

1256
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,119
they do lead to rome after all

1257
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
exactly

1258
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,000
adam what would you add in there

1259
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,040
um

1260
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,000
well first of all uh

1261
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,640
i i love that metaphor just now another

1262
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,839
thing i would add

1263
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,400
is um

1264
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,119
so like you know on my ends like i'm

1265
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,560
trying to use this as like

1266
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,160
um

1267
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,319
abstractions for understanding you know

1268
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,720
aspects of like brain functioning so

1269
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,000
let's say we're talking about these um

1270
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,880
um

1271
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,720
you know this top level

1272
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,119
um this is one way of interpreting like

1273
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,760
uh you know hippocampal place cells

1274
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,119
um

1275
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
and and the these um

1276
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,599
whether you create a new node or not

1277
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,680
based on what threshold of familiarity

1278
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,040
or surprise

1279
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
um this would potentially be like an

1280
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,319
example i think

1281
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,200
of

1282
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,880
um it's an extremely uh

1283
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,319
powerful source of individual

1284
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,520
differences

1285
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,599
like um maybe you could think of this in

1286
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,359
terms of like uh piagetian like

1287
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,680
assimilation or accommodation but you

1288
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,200
could see like if your thresholds are

1289
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,520
too low or too high

1290
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,319
you can end up representing a domain

1291
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,160
in ways with um

1292
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,520
there are other

1293
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,640
um

1294
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,880
you can get false you can get things

1295
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
that are like excessively granular or

1296
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
insufficiently granular to represent the

1297
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
domain and you can get different types

1298
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,200
of errors associated with it and so like

1299
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,160
this for instance could define um

1300
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,240
even things like more like um

1301
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,760
some people will talk like autism to

1302
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,319
schizophrenia spectrums and so they said

1303
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,160
there could be like kind of underlying

1304
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,839
predispositions for this

1305
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,359
it might actually be

1306
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,200
i think that's an oversimplification but

1307
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,720
it you could think of

1308
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,640
these thresholds as

1309
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,480
some cognitive spectrums might just fall

1310
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,240
out of them as you get different types

1311
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,359
of minds if you have like a more

1312
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,400
granular

1313
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,640
like an overly inclusive or an underly

1314
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
inclusive category structure

1315
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,960
but some other things like just drawing

1316
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,800
on this would be like if we're talking

1317
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,599
about

1318
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,960
this um

1319
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,720
you know lower level and if we're

1320
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,960
thinking of like these um like internal

1321
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,520
grid cells as you know what not quite

1322
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,559
being

1323
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,160
well the pose here aren't quite red

1324
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,200
cells but

1325
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
this idea of like

1326
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,160
this um

1327
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,520
mapping

1328
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,880
of

1329
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,800
your

1330
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,640
um

1331
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,319
what your body position is and where

1332
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,000
you're oriented

1333
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,800
and then having this conjoined with

1334
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,000
what's

1335
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,680
in your visual field and then using

1336
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,440
these sources of information

1337
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,599
uh to mutually constrain each other and

1338
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,760
using where you are in space

1339
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
um

1340
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
and these all being necessary like for

1341
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,480
instance this seems to be you know

1342
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,640
fundamentally what was needed to get the

1343
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,280
robots to work and we have not so

1344
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,440
dissimilar sensors and effectors

1345
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,480
and so well one thought is um

1346
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,440
you know

1347
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,599
i think it's um

1348
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,880
um

1349
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,559
dubai has um just messed up his name

1350
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,119
but um

1351
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,720
he has this interesting here uh paper

1352
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,200
and like default mode system as um it's

1353
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,359
called a dark control and thinking of it

1354
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,520
as doing like tree search

1355
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,839
but

1356
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,400
um

1357
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
to loop it around

1358
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,319
this pose information it's possible that

1359
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,640
some of the posterior nodes of the dmn

1360
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,800
are actually helping to encode this

1361
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,240
information

1362
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,599
um

1363
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,960
like if you go like to the parietal

1364
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
portions that actually might be where is

1365
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,599
my body where is it reflected and then

1366
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,359
if we're going like to these midline

1367
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,079
portions of it um

1368
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:52,880
you know

1369
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,480
what's in my visual field or what am i

1370
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,839
imagining

1371
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,079
and then if you want to go for like this

1372
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,160
future part that might be like the

1373
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,839
anterior portions

1374
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,280
um so like the dmn or the

1375
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,240
the

1376
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
dorsal medial prefrontal cortex may be

1377
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,680
coupling with the hippocam the anterior

1378
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,040
hippocampus but

1379
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,280
basically it would seem that like the

1380
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,880
stream

1381
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,800
these core aspects of the model might be

1382
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,040
ways of functionally understanding

1383
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,280
the core aspects of

1384
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,680
an agent architecture

1385
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,359
used for um mental stimulation

1386
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,640
uh

1387
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,599
that

1388
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,359
there seems to be a striking amount of

1389
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,760
um convergence between

1390
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,839
the things that um people like tim

1391
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,040
identifying is just like what's

1392
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,440
necessary how do we solve a problem

1393
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
and the features of normal organization

1394
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,680
uh that would be these

1395
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
defaults or

1396
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,440
canonical processes that you just you're

1397
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,920
you're seeing it as a

1398
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,280
as really just

1399
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,040
fundamental like you know

1400
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,640
we call it the default focus and it's

1401
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,559
active all the time what's it doing

1402
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,680
um maybe part of what it's doing is it's

1403
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,280
allowing us to do

1404
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,720
um this kind of navigation through

1405
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,480
space and time uh

1406
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,920
yeah so those are some thoughts

1407
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,040
navigation through space and time

1408
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
in the sort of territory

1409
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,000
sense would be clock time and metric

1410
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,880
space what is your x y z t

1411
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,119
and then navigation through mental space

1412
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,800
and time

1413
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
might have some resonances or analogies

1414
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,720
but it's not a piece of grid paper

1415
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,599
so what is it and how does it

1416
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,000
um become realized through

1417
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,079
ecology evolution and development so

1418
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,079
awesome points thank you

1419
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,559
real quickly in terms of the time issue

1420
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,680
it seems like there's these multiple

1421
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,599
ways that time comes in it's like one

1422
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,839
sense of like the sense of time as you

1423
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,599
might be doing like accumulation based

1424
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,800
on like um the the frequency with which

1425
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,240
you're having like meaningful

1426
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,800
informational events um like bud craig

1427
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,559
calls it these like global emotional

1428
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,599
moments

1429
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,440
um but

1430
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,040
and and neil and others have some i

1431
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,880
think with murray shanahan have some

1432
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,240
interesting models like the sense of

1433
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,119
time

1434
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,520
in terms of like the amount of like uh

1435
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,760
information flux through your sensors

1436
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,040
but then there's like another kind of

1437
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
time that might actually involve like

1438
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,359
overt spatialization of a trajectory and

1439
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,960
you might be using something like path

1440
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,680
integration in terms of like how

1441
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,520
you're doing some types of duration

1442
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,800
estimation

1443
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,839
not by necessarily just like

1444
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,760
accumulating like

1445
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,680
like a sense of accumulation but some of

1446
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,680
it might be like where am i and

1447
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,760
navigating through a timeline and i

1448
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,119
think you'll see this reflected in like

1449
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,640
the way people talk and we could like

1450
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,920
dismiss this and say like oh that's just

1451
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,960
mere metaphor no i i think that that

1452
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,720
that metaphor is how we're actually

1453
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,960
constructing some sense of time which

1454
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,960
actually gives us like

1455
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,559
forms of control that we would not have

1456
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,040
otherwise were we not able to actually

1457
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,800
extend our minds metaphorically in that

1458
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,599
way

1459
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,480
and

1460
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,000
then be able to basically navigate

1461
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,520
through spatialized time to keep track

1462
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,920
of some longer time sequences

1463
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,800
if we want to plan with respect to them

1464
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,480
awesome thank you stephen

1465
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,480
hello a great seal um yeah i was curious

1466
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,960
um in terms of time well one of the

1467
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,280
things is do you think time is

1468
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,960
um or this process is distributed around

1469
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,640
different parts of

1470
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,760
the sensorum uh processing because

1471
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,839
different sensors have different

1472
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,760
speeds or different rates or different

1473
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,040
abilities

1474
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,480
um and then the other thing coming back

1475
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,559
to time as well is people can be going

1476
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,319
through time

1477
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,760
they can be like

1478
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,880
or they can

1479
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,599
be time can come towards them

1480
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,000
or time can be sort of developing around

1481
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,520
them which often happens in asian

1482
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,720
cultures it's a time is seen more as a

1483
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,559
something that's around them so i'm

1484
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,920
curious like how these these ideas of

1485
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,720
temporality might might link to

1486
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,520
the ways that we imagine ourselves with

1487
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,680
our sensorium

1488
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,040
i mean if it is indeed the case that

1489
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,160
some forms of

1490
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,839
the spatialization of

1491
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,480
if it is the case of spatializing time

1492
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,880
um that's happening both

1493
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,240
um

1494
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,880
in some cases through some some fairly

1495
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,960
um abstract

1496
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,680
metaphorical and linguistic instructions

1497
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,839
then this would um

1498
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,839
imply that you should be able to get

1499
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,280
meaningful um cultural differences

1500
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,599
based on these shared constructions

1501
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,359
and maybe even some like quasi-like

1502
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,599
warfare effects where like linguistic

1503
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,079
modifications could actually

1504
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,200
change the way people are seeing

1505
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,960
themselves and others

1506
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,640
in relation to time with some fairly

1507
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,400
significant consequences

1508
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,440
so

1509
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,280
um

1510
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,280
our word warfarin affects the

1511
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,680
jargon of just like um you know the idea

1512
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,319
that the um our thought is constrained

1513
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,359
in some meaningful way by the uh

1514
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,799
constraints and affordances of our

1515
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,040
language our constraints importances on

1516
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,599
the way we think

1517
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,799
there's like stronger and weaker

1518
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,520
versions of that hypothesis

1519
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,240
thank you blue

1520
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,280
so it's interesting because we've been

1521
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,000
talking about um like spatial maps and

1522
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,839
spatial context like spatial

1523
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,359
representation navigating through space

1524
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,480
i i have been thinking a lot about um

1525
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,440
semantic navigation also like when we're

1526
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,720
looking through

1527
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,640
looking for a thought um when we're

1528
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,839
looking for

1529
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,000
um we're navigating foraging for

1530
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,799
information or you know in these context

1531
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,240
rich domains and and i just wonder um

1532
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,440
what

1533
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,440
like is the semantic navigation

1534
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,359
related to linked to

1535
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,520
um like is there overlap in the brain

1536
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,079
and the way that we process semantic

1537
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,480
orientation and representation and

1538
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,599
space

1539
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,520
also so i'm just curious

1540
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,880
hashtag maps of meaning

1541
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,640
yeah maybe uh

1542
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,040
i can uh i can respond on this

1543
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,799
from from my perspective

1544
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,640
and then i'll probably have to leave you

1545
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,440
guys

1546
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,760
um but so i think one of the most

1547
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,160
important things at least to me

1548
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,680
uh of

1549
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,760
how this this whole endeavor of

1550
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,119
constructing this

1551
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,040
uh and and doing this together with adam

1552
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,079
is that

1553
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,760
we basically we start off with uh

1554
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,319
it's robot navigation which is

1555
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,880
from a roboticist perspective is really

1556
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,839
like

1557
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,359
about x and y position and about times

1558
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,720
and seconds

1559
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,400
but what we do here is we by by creating

1560
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,280
this model we basically get rid of

1561
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,160
this

1562
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,240
close tie of

1563
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,440
being um grounded in in seconds and

1564
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,920
meters basically i think this is one of

1565
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,240
the most crucial um aspects of of our

1566
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,280
model because it's it shows that well on

1567
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,119
the one hand i think we all agree that

1568
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,280
we don't get born measuring time in

1569
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,040
seconds and measuring

1570
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,480
space in meters

1571
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,920
so

1572
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
we actually get at least the framework

1573
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,599
that also gets rid of these these

1574
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,799
metrics

1575
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,280
and just

1576
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,880
learns to navigate

1577
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,920
in this more abstract space

1578
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,720
and if we can get it to work for for

1579
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,880
navigation

1580
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,000
per se

1581
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,640
moving through actual physical space

1582
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,119
then i'm pretty sure that we can also

1583
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,319
extend them all further to navigate

1584
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,640
any abstract space because in the end

1585
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,760
these once we are at the

1586
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,400
once we get the level above are our

1587
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,280
sensory inputs then everything is in our

1588
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,400
case just a learned latent thing

1589
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,520
basically so if we can if we can make

1590
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,400
this work for physical navigation and i

1591
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
think we are already a

1592
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,240
a big step closer to to making it work

1593
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
for for any navigation then indeed we

1594
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,280
come to the realm of like okay i

1595
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,079
i have lots of memories these are tied

1596
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,200
together somehow because how how these

1597
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,280
memories just came to be

1598
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,160
can i now navigate the space towards the

1599
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,000
memory that i'm looking for

1600
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,359
or if you are solving

1601
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:45,599
a math problem how do you navigate the

1602
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,920
space of math equations to get the

1603
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,040
solution for this thing i i think

1604
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,599
once we get rid of um

1605
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,559
the the the the the

1606
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,359
the time and space that that are so

1607
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,880
tight for your your sensorium and

1608
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,359
move towards the more abstract space and

1609
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,680
be able to navigate that

1610
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,920
this is this is the crucial the crucial

1611
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,760
bit here i i would say

1612
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,920
and so with that i i i'd like to thank

1613
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,319
you for for the discussion till now i

1614
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,799
i'll try to be there next week as well

1615
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,079
and

1616
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,400
and enjoy the discussion further

1617
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,960
thank you tim

1618
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,880
cool very interesting and and uh also

1619
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,720
speaking to that

1620
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,799
cultural basis

1621
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,440
there was the inch foot

1622
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,680
pound paradigm

1623
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,960
and that has in certain places also

1624
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
coexisted or

1625
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,040
been complementary or contradictory with

1626
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,599
the centimeters grams

1627
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,359
second based upon something different

1628
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,079
and what would happen if a larva was

1629
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,880
born and the little one the second was

1630
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,960
like what we call three seconds

1631
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,839
is that just a more chill larva because

1632
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:00,880
every

1633
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
one of its moments is taking a few more

1634
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,720
heartbeats it can actually take a breath

1635
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,079
per little one

1636
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,480
so there's a lot that we probably don't

1637
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,480
even know how much we don't know

1638
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,319
until we're in feedback with these

1639
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,599
models

1640
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,960
that both

1641
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,319
fully realize not just in the equations

1642
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,040
but in the actual robotics

1643
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,799
grounding us in those actual

1644
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,599
observations of red green blue pixel

1645
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,680
intensities which is like when adam was

1646
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,200
saying that robotics are are an

1647
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,440
empirical platform to be studying the

1648
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,319
nature of cognition and brain and mind

1649
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,280
and then

1650
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,079
here

1651
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,839
is where we move into

1652
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,680
a different space and time

1653
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,359
and so that is

1654
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,839
an excellent point by tim

1655
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,240
stephen

1656
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,799
yeah so following on from what you're

1657
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,960
saying daniel is um

1658
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,119
we i know tim just mentioned about you

1659
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,640
know have the abstracted ideas

1660
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,119
but there's also maybe the grounded you

1661
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,559
mentioned grounded

1662
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,720
ways of knowing so

1663
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,319
it might be that the future will

1664
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,559
abstract out what we think

1665
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,480
it might be and then there may be ways

1666
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,559
where we feel what's right what feels so

1667
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,400
you hit a door

1668
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,480
and you feel there's an information

1669
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,839
affordance

1670
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,520
and it can ground

1671
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,599
so i was wondering how much

1672
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,839
that can

1673
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,880
um that supports not needing to have

1674
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,960
the metrics like you say and maybe the

1675
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,720
metrics that we've created like the

1676
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,000
second

1677
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,599
are partly because they're at that kind

1678
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,920
of sweet spot or somehow close to a

1679
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,319
speech sweet spot of what sort of makes

1680
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,480
sense you know someone had to decide on

1681
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,200
a foot or a hand you know so

1682
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,960
was it the small person's hand was the

1683
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,480
big person's hand and they sort of said

1684
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,640
well what about john

1685
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,079
and maybe he was the king i don't know

1686
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,200
but um but it got decided somehow so i

1687
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,119
think this is a a good question about

1688
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,880
grounding versus abstraction i don't

1689
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,319
know what uh

1690
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,640
what the thoughts are on that

1691
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,400
yes

1692
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,200
this higher level in a purely metric

1693
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
model it could be like well on the

1694
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,039
bottom level we're dealing with

1695
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,400
centimeters

1696
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,640
and 100 milliseconds

1697
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,359
frames and the coarse graining is at the

1698
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,920
level of 100 times the spatial distance

1699
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,520
and 100 times the temporal distance

1700
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,599
what this model is doing is something

1701
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,760
different and i think that is again this

1702
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,119
biological inspiration which is that

1703
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,359
what is happening in the level that the

1704
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,200
action perception loop

1705
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,359
is nested within

1706
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,220
is not just a a bigger version

1707
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,599
[Music]

1708
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,760
well it both is and isn't because it has

1709
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,559
some

1710
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,039
resonance graphical structures

1711
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,359
that support the composability and the

1712
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,680
tractability of active models

1713
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,119
yet also it's doing something that's

1714
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,960
categorically different which is

1715
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,240
navigating in a more topological

1716
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,559
space rather than the more geometric

1717
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,200
space down the bottom what are you um

1718
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,480
thinking about adam

1719
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,720
um

1720
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,720
it seems like the

1721
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,960
well i guess one is i suspect

1722
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,359
it is no coincidence that

1723
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,880
seconds

1724
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,079
are about the time

1725
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,760
extent that they are

1726
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,839
and that we have like the metric units

1727
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,160
we use like a foot

1728
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,880
or a meter or a yard

1729
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,720
in terms of like

1730
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,160
in terms of grounding and in terms of

1731
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,720
connection to affordance so like a

1732
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,799
second for maybe you know

1733
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,799
a relation to certain

1734
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,319
maybe like

1735
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,799
heart rate or certain like biophysical

1736
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,880
pattern generators or like the scope of

1737
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,720
working memory being

1738
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,240
an iconic memory being stable on

1739
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,359
different

1740
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,559
scales

1741
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,640
or like a yard or a meter like the

1742
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,400
basically on the reach that you have of

1743
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,640
your arm like like perry personal space

1744
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,440
and like

1745
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,559
uh

1746
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,319
a field of affordances around your body

1747
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,480
where it's particularly concentrated

1748
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,079
um

1749
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,119
and so

1750
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,240
you know these are ways in which like

1751
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,160
for instance like the granularity

1752
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,119
of our

1753
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,520
modeling would be influenced by language

1754
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520
or their language would reflect it and

1755
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,319
maybe

1756
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,799
um to different extents influence it but

1757
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,160
you would have like this other kind of

1758
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,319
granularity of space

1759
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,440
that might be different for different

1760
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,359
species but also within a species and

1761
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,200
with an individual like for instance

1762
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,280
like these like tilings

1763
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,160
of

1764
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,039
um

1765
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,480
so like

1766
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,760
the campus system will like lay out

1767
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,799
these like tilings of space

1768
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,280
for a task domain and they'll have like

1769
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,559
a a kind of

1770
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,240
they'll be refreshed like maybe it looks

1771
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,559
like like every three seconds or so

1772
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,880
but if you're in like a big space

1773
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,599
um

1774
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,240
but this tiling will actually affect of

1775
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,839
hexagonal

1776
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,839
arrays or effects just like hexagonal

1777
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,319
tongue it'll fill whatever space it's in

1778
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,359
and it'll have different levels of

1779
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,799
granularity

1780
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,640
and so if you're in like a big space

1781
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,160
it's going to necessarily be less

1782
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,640
granular and if you're in a small space

1783
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,200
it'll be uh probably be more granular

1784
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,559
but there's other things that influence

1785
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,640
the granularity also like um

1786
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,440
uh

1787
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,200
there's like brain stem locomotor nuclei

1788
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
they're like detecting how fast are you

1789
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,599
moving and then this will influence the

1790
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,160
granularity of like your

1791
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,839
tiling of space

1792
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,599
and so

1793
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,680
that's um it's like some of it um

1794
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,359
you know

1795
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,319
some of the of this uh what is relevant

1796
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,960
uh some of this this

1797
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,119
uh our greening of a domain some of it

1798
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,640
will be reflected by like these uh

1799
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,960
basically innate like

1800
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,000
by um architectural inductive biases and

1801
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,880
some of them will be more like

1802
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,440
socioculturally constructed

1803
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,680
um

1804
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,680
one thing just uh we're moving on is i

1805
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,799
thought i like how um uh tim you know as

1806
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,160
he left like that that was that was one

1807
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,880
uh hell of a mic drop because you know

1808
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,839
the thing is like basically yeah so he's

1809
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,920
already solved like in terms of kinds of

1810
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,039
grounding

1811
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,680
like not only is this like potentially a

1812
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,839
way of having

1813
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,000
an architecture capable of navigating

1814
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,880
conceptual domains and abstractions

1815
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,480
basically what bengio calls like system

1816
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,760
2ai

1817
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,680
or what some would call like strong ai

1818
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,760
but it's also grounding in that it

1819
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,359
actually works as a control system for

1820
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,599
an embodied embedded agent and so now

1821
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,559
you might have a single system capable

1822
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,000
of both giving you symbol grounding by

1823
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,599
allowing something to be in the world

1824
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,520
alongside other agents

1825
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,039
and have actual

1826
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,880
actual semantics

1827
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,720
um in terms of pointing to things in the

1828
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,559
world like you can have like a semantic

1829
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,400
network um

1830
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,240
just like symbols pointing at symbols

1831
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,960
but ultimately these such a system would

1832
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,799
allow you to ground out your semantic

1833
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:49,760
network

1834
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,359
in things in the world and shared

1835
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,200
symbols

1836
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,359
and so um i mean ultimately this is a

1837
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,160
path to you know who knows how far um

1838
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,000
you know anyone working on it today gets

1839
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,960
but this is ultimately a path to agi

1840
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,920
built

1841
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,720
that takes on an activist principles of

1842
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,119
what you would need to do so

1843
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,880
which is more than a little exciting i

1844
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,920
think

1845
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,760
oh i'm starting to see why people are

1846
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,720
interested in this

1847
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,200
excellent point about the symbolic

1848
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,200
semantics and logic and how that

1849
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,960
connects to the inactive insight the

1850
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,720
pragmatic turn

1851
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,400
ecological psychology biosemiosis like

1852
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,760
all of these features that get left

1853
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,319
on the cutting block if we take a

1854
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,839
computational linguistics approach only

1855
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,319
and uh computational linguistics plus

1856
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,599
the mouth movement already one has

1857
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,039
incorporated

1858
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,200
that pragmatic turn and that embodiment

1859
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,720
element and that's quite a different

1860
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,640
model than just the substrate

1861
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,960
independent symbol

1862
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,839
manipulator

1863
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,880
stephen yeah i think it's exciting

1864
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,280
indeed because it can open up a lot of

1865
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,960
i'm really interested in mental space

1866
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,000
psychology and perry personal space and

1867
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,480
working with space as an instrument and

1868
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,240
uh well i'm more than interested in it

1869
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,400
that's my main focus

1870
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,799
in in many ways and um

1871
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
but what's really been the challenge is

1872
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,479
um

1873
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,679
giving it a plausible bridge right back

1874
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,679
because they're working primarily you're

1875
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,880
looking at what action policies are

1876
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,040
and what has been enacted

1877
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,839
um and it's very hard to go back to

1878
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,679
observations because you're coming from

1879
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,520
the other direction so

1880
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,799
i think it'd be really interesting to

1881
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,880
see what this robot whether you could

1882
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,279
actually see well what kind of robot is

1883
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,880
this robot

1884
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,120
what's it like what kind of

1885
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,399
story patterning gets triggered by this

1886
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,560
robot and maybe if i

1887
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,359
it grew up with a slightly heavier

1888
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,319
wheel on one side or something it has a

1889
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,120
slightly different

1890
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,920
character you know so i mean i wonder if

1891
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,759
there's a kind of an actual

1892
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,000
uh a way that the action policies

1893
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,399
themselves start to encode

1894
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,399
a certain personality

1895
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,600
based on

1896
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,158
the physicality and

1897
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,238
sensorim that get weighted

1898
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,000
i mean that would be like in terms of

1899
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,719
this like generalization of um slam

1900
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:23,839
principles

1901
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,520
as like a way of understanding cognition

1902
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,719
more generally i think that would be

1903
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,120
like a great test case and that like

1904
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,560
those are the kinds of hypotheses you

1905
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,759
would look for

1906
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:32,719
um

1907
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,799
i think you're if your wheel is like

1908
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,399
weighted more heavily on one side or the

1909
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,359
other

1910
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,560
that could have all sorts of things like

1911
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,679
for instance like

1912
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,040
um like

1913
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,000
what

1914
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,359
tim was describing like this node

1915
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:44,479
creation

1916
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,799
where it's not just a function of like a

1917
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,359
metrics but on

1918
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,960
information

1919
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,920
and

1920
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,600
the

1921
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,280
and so this creates like a

1922
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,440
a distorted space but but an adaptively

1923
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,600
distorted space you would expect usually

1924
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,679
because multiple forms of value are

1925
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,719
influencing the granularity of this um

1926
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,640
instead of space like necessarily it's

1927
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,719
like a map it's like space is a graph

1928
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,120
but but a graph being shaped by multiple

1929
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,640
kinds of value

1930
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,080
and so you would expect things like like

1931
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,360
that kind of wheel asymmetry you're

1932
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,960
talking about to result

1933
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,719
in different kinds of graft spaces and

1934
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,239
this could then potentially have some

1935
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,360
transfer

1936
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,120
um more generally

1937
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,960
across more than just physical spaces in

1938
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,840
theory

1939
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
um

1940
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,960
also you know coming back to that

1941
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,239
granularity issue like let's say like um

1942
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,520
the way you move through the world is

1943
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,199
quicker or slower

1944
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,199
that itself then might have transferred

1945
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,040
not just to well how is it that i'm

1946
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,400
representing the space i'm physically

1947
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,480
moving through but that then could get

1948
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,640
reflected in cognitive styles in terms

1949
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,880
of like the way you re you relate to

1950
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,520
like semantic spaces in terms of the way

1951
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,440
you you're going to forage through them

1952
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,320
um what you consider to be um near or

1953
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,719
far connections so like this is the kind

1954
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,239
of like

1955
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,679
and that would be like a whole research

1956
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:02,800
program

1957
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,000
which would be

1958
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,080
um but using this as like a source of

1959
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,760
bridging principles of like so some

1960
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,080
connection between embodied experience

1961
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,640
and then more abstract thinking well

1962
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,480
maybe this is a source of some of the

1963
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,920
ways in which concrete and body

1964
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,840
experiences go on to

1965
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,040
shape

1966
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,280
um

1967
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,719
basically fought on a more abstract

1968
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,840
level as well

1969
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,360
very

1970
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,239
very

1971
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,560
interesting and especially when we think

1972
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,400
about the mental action

1973
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,239
papers that we've read like live stream

1974
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,640
number 25 with xanthed smith at all

1975
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,520
about metacognition as mental action

1976
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,480
and so

1977
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,000
in this two-level robotics case

1978
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,239
we're talking about the sort of

1979
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,920
lower level motion

1980
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,080
and then the higher level navigation of

1981
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,679
locations where we can say i want to go

1982
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,440
to the post office and then the grocery

1983
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,440
store but then we have this more

1984
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,679
tactical taking a step

1985
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,840
time scale that's a lot faster

1986
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,800
if this bottom layer is

1987
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,080
based upon cognition and perception also

1988
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,400
this higher level is not just navigation

1989
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,760
in

1990
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,400
the warehouse that's actually like where

1991
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,880
do i want to be in my regime of

1992
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,040
attention or what would i like to be

1993
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,560
considering from a metacognitive

1994
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,440
perspective how do i navigate to a place

1995
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,400
where i prefer what's healthy for me so

1996
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,600
there's all kinds of other questions

1997
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,000
about navigation in parameter spaces

1998
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,840
that are not just like

1999
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,679
topologically the cousin of the

2000
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,560
warehouse space but truly

2001
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,520
in the mental space fully um blue and

2002
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,159
then stephen

2003
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,239
so since we brought up hierarchical um

2004
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,719
here in the paper it looks like and i

2005
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,800
mean i can hold this for tim adam too if

2006
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,320
you don't feel like comfortable talking

2007
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,760
about it but maybe maybe you're you're

2008
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,360
good um in the hierarchical space

2009
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,600
it seems that it's just a core screening

2010
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,239
like in this paper right so like you

2011
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:07,440
know the the higher level is just like a

2012
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,280
coarse grained version of what happens

2013
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,120
at the lower level

2014
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,840
and it's easy to see how that takes

2015
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,080
place or takes shape in

2016
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,440
like a topographical way um

2017
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,440
it doesn't leave a lot of room for

2018
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,000
emergence and i wonder like if we jump

2019
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,640
to thinking about a semantic space

2020
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,320
um you know we have words we've got the

2021
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,400
relationships with words to each other

2022
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,000
proximity you know how close do you

2023
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,880
expect to find you know there to was or

2024
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,280
or whatever so so how how linked are the

2025
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,159
words together in a semantic space but i

2026
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,800
wonder if you know you can go into topic

2027
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,960
modeling and that gives you like a kind

2028
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,040
of a core screening

2029
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,800
but but like is there more room for

2030
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,560
emergence in that kind of

2031
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,080
space maybe

2032
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,040
um or like what other like how do you i

2033
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,040
don't know how how would you

2034
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,159
just allow

2035
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,640
for emergent things to come through in

2036
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,640
this kind of hierarchical modeling or

2037
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,960
mapping

2038
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,800
i think um when

2039
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,280
tim comes back um it could be worth it

2040
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,199
for him to go into more detail

2041
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,719
on the

2042
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,880
parameters that go into

2043
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,480
uh

2044
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,800
node creation or not

2045
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,159
because i feel like

2046
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,800
to the extent that you're getting

2047
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,400
some flexibility and ways of

2048
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,480
understanding like emergence

2049
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,159
that would be your your models of

2050
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:31,840
emergence and or whether that would be

2051
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,040
like where

2052
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,280
you would basically create um

2053
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,880
this corresponding ontology of different

2054
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,960
levels of granularity

2055
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,440
what um

2056
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,360
what constitutes like an occasion for

2057
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,600
core screening of what kinds

2058
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,840
um

2059
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,199
it seems like

2060
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,159
the node creation would be where your

2061
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,560
your assumptions about that

2062
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,320
of what kinds of emergency might be

2063
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,520
dealing with

2064
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,480
um

2065
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,520
that's where it would come into this

2066
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,640
kind of model

2067
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,560
um is it rich enough

2068
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,040
uh to account for like oh i i wouldn't

2069
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,800
quite say that um

2070
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,679
in terms of like you know all the

2071
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,760
different forms of emergency you can get

2072
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,880
um so some of it you know

2073
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,000
but that is for but for um by enough i

2074
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,239
mean you know enough to be you know a

2075
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,880
full on general intelligence but

2076
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,120
um

2077
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,880
but but i do think there is room for

2078
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,679
some

2079
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,679
some flexibility there um at that

2080
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,320
parametrization of of tim's model but

2081
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,519
he would explain it better than i would

2082
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,600
i'll i'll make a comment and then ask a

2083
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,280
question in the chat and then also see

2084
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,280
stephen so um it was mentioned that uh

2085
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,080
there is the embodiment of certain prior

2086
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,080
information in the continuous attractor

2087
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,920
network like if my position is this and

2088
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,679
i move forward then that is putting me

2089
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,320
into this different position in the can

2090
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,760
and um

2091
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,840
blue asked about topic modeling in

2092
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,880
semantic spaces so that territory is

2093
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,880
different so the maps should be

2094
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,360
appropriately different and so we could

2095
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,400
say for example

2096
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,199
like

2097
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,000
california is nested within the united

2098
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,040
states

2099
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,600
that is not violating any geographical

2100
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,640
priors

2101
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,960
but um what about a paper that's

2102
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,640
interdisciplinary

2103
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,960
that might be at the intersection of two

2104
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,199
different topics or depending on how

2105
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:26,159
those topic models are generated

2106
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,159
one could think of every paper as

2107
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,679
existing across 100 different topics to

2108
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,960
different quantitative amounts and so it

2109
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,400
actually does bring us to this question

2110
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,560
which sid has asked which is

2111
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,760
we're hearing

2112
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,400
a lot in in the paper in the natural

2113
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,560
speech and so on

2114
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,080
different

2115
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,400
complementarities

2116
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,560
lower and higher

2117
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,159
so here where the lower model is the

2118
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,960
finer scale and the the red i'm trying

2119
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,960
not to mix metaphors but lower and

2120
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,920
higher

2121
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,640
is sometimes used with inner and outer

2122
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,840
or finer and coarser coarse graining

2123
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,960
more specific more general so

2124
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,480
what is that

2125
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,679
restaurant

2126
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,880
where those are the dishes

2127
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,640
how could it something be above or below

2128
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,719
and you get it but it could also be more

2129
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,040
like a kernel and more like the fruit

2130
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,040
and you get it and it could be more like

2131
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,800
sand or more like gravel and you would

2132
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,080
get it

2133
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,600
what does that mean or say

2134
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,840
we'll think and then allow adam to speak

2135
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,840
first

2136
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,239
i think that's a deep and complex

2137
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,120
question

2138
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,560
um

2139
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,560
and there's a couple levels or a couple

2140
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,120
of entry points there but

2141
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,679
um one thing is like you mentioned like

2142
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:14,960
inner and outer is another way of

2143
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,159
describing it's supposed to higher and

2144
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,719
lower and there's there's a

2145
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,719
i think connection between this arc this

2146
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,040
leighton stem architecture

2147
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,640
and like um

2148
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,360
and meta learning where you're

2149
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,199
um having like a more fine-grained

2150
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,679
process for like

2151
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,880
that's more task specific and for like

2152
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,640
adaptive five-grain couplings but then

2153
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,920
you nest that

2154
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,000
rather you create like an outer loop

2155
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,920
which is like a slower aggregation

2156
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,560
process that's coarser but then allows

2157
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,080
for sharing of information across

2158
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,280
episodes

2159
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,120
and so it's a kind of like

2160
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,960
so this is basically a kind of metal

2161
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,400
learning system

2162
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,000
and giving you this divide and conquer

2163
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,960
approach of like levels of granularity

2164
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,840
um

2165
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,120
i don't think

2166
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,400
anyone quite knows um yet

2167
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
what the significance of this is but one

2168
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,560
interesting thing about the grid cells

2169
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,719
is they seem to have

2170
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,360
a multi-scale hierarchy in their

2171
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,880
organization

2172
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,960
in terms of there's this axis

2173
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,199
i believe is as you go

2174
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,080
within enter rhino cortex as you go like

2175
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,239
more um

2176
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,520
uh

2177
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,800
uh

2178
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,360
dorsal to ventral or more superior to

2179
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,040
inferior

2180
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,760
it you'll get these like

2181
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,440
discrete cut-offs

2182
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,120
of um

2183
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,880
potentially implying some kind of

2184
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,600
um harmonic nesting of scales maybe even

2185
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,840
coupling with like multi-scale like

2186
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,880
synchronous

2187
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,280
dynamics and cortex unclear

2188
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,360
um but there does seem to be these like

2189
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,760
multiple scales reflected

2190
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,480
in the or in grid skills in internal

2191
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,719
crystals having different levels of

2192
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,000
granularity of their spatial

2193
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,880
representations

2194
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,880
and the the thing that's interesting i

2195
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,520
i'm curious about is like one of the

2196
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,320
or one thing i'm curious about is like

2197
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,400
to what degree for instance

2198
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,080
do different neuromodulator systems like

2199
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,000
some of the ways in which like

2200
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,199
they could be understood in terms of

2201
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,280
like them having their functions is

2202
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,400
maybe like influencing which granularity

2203
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,679
is most

2204
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,480
um present like moving into like now

2205
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,760
we're in a situation of like attending

2206
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,199
to like the fine granules and or this is

2207
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,560
a situation where we're going to really

2208
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,600
go course and just ignore those details

2209
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,440
and that some neuromodulatory systems

2210
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,120
there um

2211
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,639
and their effects on like neurodynamics

2212
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,560
might actually be best explained might

2213
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,080
be well explained in terms of this like

2214
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,080
adaptive changing of the granularity

2215
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,560
very

2216
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,440
cool and we see that in teamwork where

2217
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,080
sometimes it's time to control paste

2218
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,159
and just fill out the spreadsheet other

2219
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,080
times it's time to add a column to the

2220
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,560
spreadsheet other times there are this

2221
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,440
open-endedness to the task and including

2222
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,320
the

2223
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,199
local objectives and also even broader

2224
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,280
mission and one's own relationship to

2225
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,199
the team in the project so

2226
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,560
um

2227
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,120
perhaps if there's a similar biological

2228
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,480
substrate

2229
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,560
then it would stand to reason that there

2230
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,239
could be multiple

2231
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,080
representations that are emitted from

2232
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,719
some kind of common generative model

2233
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,159
stephen

2234
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,000
uh um like the cop thought before i

2235
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,840
forget um

2236
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,199
so one thing that i'm actually really

2237
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,840
interested in is exploring these slam

2238
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,040
principles

2239
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,719
in the insect case because they have

2240
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,360
like um analogous and potentially

2241
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,040
largely homologous systems with the

2242
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,880
central complex

2243
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,679
and

2244
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,920
i feel like that's a like um an area

2245
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,080
like i'm looking to look into next is

2246
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,840
like to really understand these things

2247
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,679
not just looking at the mammal case but

2248
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,199
i look at the insect case with the

2249
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,800
central complex and see the similarities

2250
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
and differences you know what what

2251
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,760
special adaptations were there um

2252
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,280
what what to what are the functions

2253
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,639
realized by similar means or different

2254
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:07,920
means but

2255
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,920
this um in terms of like a way of

2256
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,360
understanding things like like that

2257
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,120
neuromodulator hypothesis of like

2258
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,480
influencing like the granularity of

2259
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,000
spatial modeling

2260
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,920
it's possible although i wouldn't you

2261
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,159
know necessarily um

2262
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,639
that on that i'm based on conversations

2263
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,880
with you david but like um

2264
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,320
it's possible that then you're getting

2265
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,560
like extensive homology and common

2266
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,840
significances for things like flexible

2267
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,120
influencing the granularity of the

2268
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,199
forging parameters it's possible those

2269
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,840
are con like remarkably conserved and

2270
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,520
that you might actually see them

2271
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,280
that being said like you also were

2272
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,600
alluding to though the slam instance is

2273
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,440
different than insects in that this is a

2274
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,120
this is a multi-slam

2275
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,800
um in general there's a lot of

2276
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,560
multi-stem happening you know

2277
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,639
invertebrates also but i think not to

2278
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,159
the same degree and that so you might

2279
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,239
expect some potentially substantial

2280
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,880
differences there as a result of

2281
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,480
the slam problem being having that

2282
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,320
additional weights additional set of

2283
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,840
challenges and

2284
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,280
uh uh sources of information it can

2285
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,440
leverage

2286
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,639
i can't wait for solitary wasp slam

2287
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,120
and you social colony slam

2288
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,519
stephen

2289
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,600
from what i'm hearing you could you

2290
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,320
could correlate these multi slams to

2291
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,400
regimes of attention in many ways

2292
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,440
because

2293
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,080
that that could dictate the nature of

2294
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,440
these granularities and where they are

2295
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,400
in the space and the place in the body

2296
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,360
so

2297
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,520
um because

2298
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,000
we often assume i think when blue is

2299
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,920
saying they're about

2300
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,360
there's there's

2301
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,679
inner outer and the some of those are

2302
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,880
also false assumptions that that rolls

2303
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,400
out over everything

2304
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,120
that we should so in the sense that

2305
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,560
inner

2306
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,360
is

2307
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:00,159
purer and higher is purer but often

2308
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,960
that might depend on the multi slam

2309
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,480
that's being dunked at the time

2310
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,120
yeah like um one note then blue like

2311
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,920
coarser and finer slower and faster so

2312
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,600
one interpretation would be that the

2313
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,280
slower time scale is the coarser

2314
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,880
graining

2315
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,400
in the sense that it's like seconds not

2316
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,400
milliseconds and the finer is the faster

2317
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,960
but there's also maybe an interpretation

2318
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,199
where actually the if you're clicking up

2319
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,840
mile by mile instead of foot by foot

2320
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,440
that is actually moving faster and it's

2321
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
coarser and if you're counting grains of

2322
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,719
sand at a time it's finer and slower so

2323
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,960
i think even sometimes the direction

2324
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,880
that one interprets

2325
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,719
is not there but it doesn't remove the

2326
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,360
dialectical nature or the intermodal

2327
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,840
nature but the the way that um is it

2328
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,130
going to be like um

2329
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,960
[Music]

2330
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,520
a sugar with all the ohs pointing down

2331
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,840
or all the o h is pointing up or some

2332
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,560
blend has to go one way or the other but

2333
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,639
maybe it doesn't have to be any one

2334
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,560
specific way

2335
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,880
blue

2336
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,239
so

2337
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,719
i am wondering and this is also

2338
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,159
interesting in terms of the insights

2339
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:13,280
case

2340
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,760
if there's some kind of um

2341
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,960
maybe like a generic

2342
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,080
pre-installed like

2343
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,480
readily adaptable coarse-grained version

2344
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,440
of a place cell like that's just

2345
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,800
kind of there is like a generic

2346
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,239
representation so like a perfect example

2347
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,679
i mean when you're thinking about core

2348
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,760
screening like a map at a location like

2349
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,960
you know where everything is in your

2350
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,239
house like you know where your bathroom

2351
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,239
is and you know where all the things are

2352
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,480
but you know when you travel you have an

2353
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,480
expectation even if you've never been to

2354
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,320
the hotel before you have the

2355
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,760
expectation of what the elevator is

2356
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,840
going to sound like how the carpet all

2357
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,440
looks the same with that funky weird

2358
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,440
pattern and the hallways twist and turn

2359
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,480
and

2360
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,840
like when you get into the hotel room

2361
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,120
there's going to be a bathroom and

2362
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,320
there's going to be a window and there's

2363
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,000
going to be a bed and a tv and a remote

2364
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,679
so you have this like

2365
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,760
pre generic

2366
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,440
supposition of how the hotel is going to

2367
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,520
look does that live in a place cell

2368
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,159
somewhere that just like morphs into oh

2369
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,520
the bathroom's here and the light's here

2370
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,800
so that you're not stumbling around in

2371
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,480
the middle of the night like and

2372
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,080
similarly like there's all kinds of when

2373
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,920
you go out hiking you know you expect

2374
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,480
there to be trees and rocks and and

2375
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,880
stuff outside and so do you just like

2376
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,199
mash your map onto like some

2377
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,920
pre-existing generic

2378
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,960
place holder a place cell placeholder

2379
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,080
it's interesting to think about

2380
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,320
it's like a prior for the abstract space

2381
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,239
it's a prior distribution over hotel

2382
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,000
rooms which is totally uncultured and

2383
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,400
totally based upon experience and then

2384
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,639
either one is surprised or not just as

2385
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,840
with when any other

2386
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,440
prior meets

2387
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,800
sense

2388
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,639
um adam what do you think it then steve

2389
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,480
i mean these are um

2390
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,639
details that are definitely like

2391
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,719
half or beyond the edge of anything

2392
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,360
um i or maybe anyone knows but the

2393
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,600
um

2394
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,199
i guess you said like these

2395
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,520
how many different

2396
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,679
so one way that these um place fields

2397
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,440
are sometimes modeled

2398
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,199
is in terms of like these like chained

2399
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,480
attractors

2400
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,840
and so like within the hippocampus

2401
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,000
system like you can get like this highly

2402
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,679
recurrent activity

2403
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,920
especially in some of the subfields

2404
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,199
and

2405
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:33,520
you can set up like this set of um

2406
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,199
these densities of

2407
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,040
um

2408
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,480
recurrent activity and then you could

2409
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,239
have like information kind of moving

2410
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,560
between them as a like predictive map

2411
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,920
not just of like

2412
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,719
not just like here's the things but um

2413
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,320
you know people debate how best things

2414
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,840
like gershman talks about success

2415
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,360
representations but that there's a

2416
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,880
transition structure

2417
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,280
of which attractor will act which of the

2418
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,280
places will activate first in the

2419
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,120
sequence

2420
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,120
and

2421
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,639
and so i guess the question the question

2422
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:03,920
i'm wondering is so like you know you're

2423
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,520
encountering like a new scene and you're

2424
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,000
like laying down like a set of landmarks

2425
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,600
or a tiling of space

2426
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,480
like

2427
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,320
to what degree

2428
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,679
is this information encoded in

2429
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,920
um in what circumstances and to what

2430
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,280
degree is it

2431
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,600
encoded in like the local connectivity

2432
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,040
within the campus system and whether

2433
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,520
you're getting like this set of schemas

2434
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,800
that you're gonna like draw up like the

2435
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,000
most similar one based on

2436
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,159
some like degree of similarity will

2437
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,400
cause like one attractor network to get

2438
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,320
pulled up over another and now this is

2439
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,600
the talent you're working within and

2440
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,719
this is like

2441
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,719
the policies for the the policy set

2442
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,400
you're likely to be pulling from and

2443
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
this is your framing of the domain

2444
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,440
um

2445
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,679
or to what degree is it relying more

2446
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:48,800
heavily

2447
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,040
on like the moments of moments um like

2448
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,960
cortical dynamics and like the mental

2449
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,120
simulation that might be happening and

2450
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,159
like to which

2451
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,120
extent like is it constrained

2452
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,840
by the history of plasticity within the

2453
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,000
hippocampus what schemas are going to be

2454
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,120
operative

2455
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,440
um and to what degree is it more of a

2456
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,280
negotiation

2457
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,159
where it's going to be more ad hoc

2458
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,840
more determined by the momentum

2459
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,520
contingencies and this funneling through

2460
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,400
the whole

2461
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,360
like

2462
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,440
cortical virtual reality machinery or

2463
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,800
everyone think of it

2464
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,840
um

2465
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,080
and to what degree is this

2466
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,840
there's not one answer this varies both

2467
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,760
across within individuals

2468
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,520
that this is actually like

2469
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,440
a core aspect of cybernetic functioning

2470
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,719
is actually

2471
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,520
leaning more heavily on the priors or

2472
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,120
the current of

2473
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,560
established

2474
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,440
um over more than more learning efforts

2475
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,400
are leaning more on like the

2476
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,960
situationally specific factors like how

2477
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,400
much do you shoehorn what's going on

2478
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,320
into your existing schemas how much do

2479
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,159
you simulate how much do you accommodate

2480
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,360
and that this being potentially like a

2481
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,040
flexible parameter

2482
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,560
and maybe some of that flexibility is

2483
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,760
like is

2484
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,120
like baked into the logic of

2485
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,120
neuromodulators like

2486
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,520
actually flexibly influencing this

2487
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,520
uh unclear but like yeah certainly uh

2488
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,920
very very edge of anything but it's it's

2489
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,280
very much like

2490
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,639
part of the excitement for me is like

2491
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,719
wondering like

2492
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,719
is this like

2493
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,480
um

2494
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,080
does this provide like like like a

2495
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,920
functional an algorithmic significance

2496
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,040
for like

2497
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,600
this like otherwise like just mess of

2498
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,760
like biological details like do some of

2499
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,440
them have like elegant cybernetic

2500
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,880
understandings

2501
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,639
by virtue of like

2502
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:31,199
thinking of these kinds of questions

2503
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:32,880
can i just respond really quickly yes

2504
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,040
please blue um

2505
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,000
so

2506
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,679
that made me think a whole bunch about

2507
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,719
like maybe we don't need a map a place

2508
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:42,719
cell for each individual hotel room but

2509
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,880
it's like a node when we were discussing

2510
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,040
nodes earlier like a coarse grained just

2511
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,360
an attractor space like dump all of the

2512
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,920
hotel room maps into this little nodule

2513
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,760
so that when you get to a hotel room

2514
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,280
it's all the same

2515
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,800
thing like it's oh okay i've been here

2516
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,400
before even if you've never been to that

2517
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,239
kind of place and and that would kind of

2518
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,560
explain things like deja vu like when

2519
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,840
you get to a place like i've been here

2520
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,520
before when did i come here like when

2521
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,719
you're driving down the street didn't i

2522
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,239
just drive down this street

2523
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,320
you it just lumped over there into that

2524
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,239
little attractor

2525
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,560
mesh node that's not necessarily a

2526
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,679
specific

2527
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,159
place but just like a squishy ball of

2528
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,960
similar places

2529
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,440
and also i really love how we spoke

2530
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,199
about some of these things

2531
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,760
adam and your collaboration with colin

2532
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,639
de young cybernetic big five

2533
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:33,040
in live stream number 13 i think at the

2534
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,520
beginning of 2021

2535
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,360
and now we're revisiting

2536
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,199
same but different more things change

2537
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,719
the more they stay the same and this

2538
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,199
idea of like modulatory features of

2539
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,920
cybernetic systems as being important

2540
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,840
for variation within and among

2541
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,080
individuals is just such an essential

2542
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,840
point and it's so true that

2543
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,920
a lot of the details are yet to be

2544
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,800
resolved stephen

2545
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,560
yeah you could go a bit further still

2546
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,520
because

2547
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,920
what if you don't have maps put to one

2548
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,520
side but there's action policies

2549
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,800
and i've actually been interested in how

2550
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,320
much this is feasible but action

2551
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,880
policies that recapitulate something

2552
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,320
like a map

2553
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,360
so like

2554
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,239
by an embodiment by an inactive chain of

2555
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,719
or initiation of some actions at

2556
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,719
different scales it basically

2557
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,360
recapitulates some sort of

2558
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,400
nascent

2559
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,719
starting point so you don't have to have

2560
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,440
any representations there and like when

2561
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,120
the door is

2562
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,560
engaged

2563
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,719
the set of actions

2564
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,639
that that

2565
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,520
that creates could open up

2566
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,400
an effectively a map um so i don't know

2567
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,679
how much between

2568
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,840
i mean i know in this model it does

2569
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,159
start to create a network of attractors

2570
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:52,159
but i'm wondering whether how much

2571
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:53,360
things could

2572
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,080
be sparked off from

2573
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,080
engaging a particular affordance a

2574
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,480
particular meaningfulness in something

2575
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,320
um

2576
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,760
i mean

2577
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,719
there's actually

2578
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,360
like a live debate um about like

2579
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,440
the extent to which

2580
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,960
so like tolman initially was talking

2581
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,960
about the hippocampal cognitive map

2582
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,800
and part of the reason people like to

2583
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,280
talk about maps is because of the um

2584
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,199
flexibility they give you

2585
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:22,400
in terms of

2586
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,239
um if you

2587
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,320
um like the map serves as a generative

2588
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,400
model and that it like it it gives you

2589
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,360
like a

2590
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,440
um

2591
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,760
i can flexibly access it to generate

2592
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,159
trajectories but you can do that with a

2593
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,840
well-structured graph also but there's

2594
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,600
like a spectrum of interpretations of

2595
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,520
people thinking

2596
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,120
that you're dealing with more things

2597
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,960
that are more map-like

2598
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,639
and things that are more

2599
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:47,719
um

2600
01:33:47,719 --> 01:33:50,320
context-specific and graph like

2601
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,400
and and flexible and more dynamically

2602
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,560
constructed and

2603
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,840
it seems like you know um

2604
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,800
like

2605
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,080
it's kind of a pop-up but in general i'm

2606
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,080
like i always like take every debate and

2607
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,840
i'm like you're probably both right and

2608
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,199
so it's like

2609
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,360
you want like for the sake of i guess

2610
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,960
maybe stability

2611
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,199
or for the sake of

2612
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,920
um potentially greater transfer

2613
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,600
of understandings and

2614
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,120
inferential power across episodes you

2615
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,040
might want something more map like

2616
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,840
but if you go to map like you're losing

2617
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,679
like the ability to deal like the

2618
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,480
nuances of like specific contexts

2619
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,520
and so

2620
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,800
um

2621
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,880
you know so this again this might be

2622
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,400
like different perspectives on the same

2623
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,400
thing that that tend to converge with

2624
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,880
trade-offs like you could have

2625
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,600
more context-sensitive or more um

2626
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,520
situationally invariant representations

2627
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,520
and and these could reflect cognitive

2628
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,760
styles and and maybe like fundamental

2629
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,800
axes of variation for cognition and

2630
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,320
sense-making

2631
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,559
um

2632
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,679
yeah the

2633
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,920
one thing that's uh

2634
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,800
in terms of like cybernetics uh danielle

2635
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,320
pointed out like earlier like you know

2636
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,880
like jordan peterson like part of like

2637
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,719
it's actually interesting that um maps

2638
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,440
of meeting um peterson's book was

2639
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,920
actually heavily informed by

2640
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,600
um jacques pancep's affective

2641
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,880
neuroscience

2642
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,960
and ecological models more generally

2643
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,560
like based on things like animal

2644
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,239
foraging so i actually think that's

2645
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,920
where jordan peterson got that rhetoric

2646
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,320
about maps is actually from doing a kind

2647
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,040
of

2648
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,639
affective neuroscience perspective

2649
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,880
grounded um in

2650
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,280
the this ecological perspective of

2651
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,960
forging animals

2652
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,480
and so

2653
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,600
yeah i think that's actually where that

2654
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,679
came from

2655
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,480
yes

2656
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,960
very nice and and i think i agree we may

2657
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,080
have even

2658
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,840
explored as such

2659
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,560
in in one paper reimagining maps that i

2660
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,159
wrote with rj and a colleague mikel

2661
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,679
we learned about this historical

2662
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,600
distinction between archival maps and

2663
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,760
itinerary maps and today we just think

2664
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,840
about maps as being like one more lumpy

2665
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,600
category but there's many differences

2666
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,600
between the map that actually is like a

2667
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,880
multi-map

2668
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,280
or mega map and holds a lot of

2669
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,239
information potentially in a metric way

2670
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:10,800
versus the itinerary map head straight

2671
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,719
until you see the two big trees then

2672
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,800
you're going to want to take a left that

2673
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,400
type of more conversational or casual or

2674
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,159
navigable map that is highly contextual

2675
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:23,920
and with current map systems that's one

2676
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,360
of the challenges because we have that

2677
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,119
mega map

2678
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,480
it's downloadable but it's not going to

2679
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,840
fit on your phone

2680
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,440
so what is the

2681
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,239
projection that's contextual and

2682
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,920
situational that's actually going to

2683
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,639
enable effective action

2684
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,480
that is also going to be perceived as

2685
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,320
map like by the user

2686
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
um

2687
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,880
yes blue

2688
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,639
so this is like a personal attack in

2689
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,480
question

2690
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,320
so anybody who spent any kind of time

2691
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,199
with daniel knows that he's constantly

2692
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:00,159
drawing or writing or or writing things

2693
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,600
down like all the time taking notes

2694
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,840
taking notes taking notes and i i wonder

2695
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,880
like can you take your notes as like a

2696
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,119
mental map of where you were at that

2697
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,719
time that you were making that drawing

2698
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,320
like does it like

2699
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,920
recapitulate your

2700
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,360
conversations that you were having the

2701
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,400
ideas that were running through your

2702
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,159
head like can you use these drawings

2703
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,400
that you're always doing as like a kind

2704
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,679
of conversational like mental space map

2705
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,960
if anything it's the opposite

2706
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,199
i just leave the thought behind and if

2707
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,199
we look at this i think okay something

2708
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,600
happened by which we wrote this down it

2709
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,600
would be awesome if there was

2710
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,280
many people with their regime of

2711
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,440
attention on taking live notes i know

2712
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,679
that's not an approach for everybody but

2713
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,760
then we could all look at that shared

2714
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,679
pheromone distribution

2715
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,480
and then make it new again and maybe we

2716
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,760
remember our exact previous thought

2717
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,040
though that's impossible or unlikely but

2718
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,119
instead we can make the

2719
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,960
relationship with the material and with

2720
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,360
those notes like new again

2721
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,759
stephen

2722
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,400
yes maybe a little harder to categorize

2723
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,920
with language but

2724
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,440
in a way it's the traces of

2725
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,600
your action policies

2726
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,239
even if it was capturing

2727
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,880
the interpretation so one thing i'm very

2728
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,280
interested in is how we if we realign

2729
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,440
things to action

2730
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,719
um because

2731
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,800
we we've kind of been enculturated to

2732
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,560
think it's all about thoughts and

2733
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,480
feelings right and

2734
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,560
because action active inference puts it

2735
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,159
in this other domain

2736
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,159
what does that mean

2737
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,639
and how do we talk about active

2738
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,719
inference when we're cult enculturated

2739
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,440
to think through other

2740
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,520
natural ways of using english i'm

2741
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,119
finding that a big challenge myself but

2742
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,360
i think so as you're laying down those

2743
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,719
traces

2744
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,600
are you showing your action policies of

2745
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,360
how to

2746
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,280
record something

2747
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,280
rather than your thoughts

2748
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,719
if that makes sense

2749
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,560
um and is your thoughts always slightly

2750
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,400
hidden

2751
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,719
yeah great question just like we were

2752
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:11,040
thinking about earlier with a sort of

2753
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,320
substrate implicit agnostic ignored

2754
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,119
linguistic symbolic models

2755
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,520
like a turing tape it has infinite space

2756
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,199
and it can just make infinite grammar

2757
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,440
and so that sort of purely symbolic

2758
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,600
approach to language

2759
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,199
and then its relationship to thought and

2760
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,600
experience is one question but when we

2761
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,719
think about finite actual sequences of

2762
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,239
language use and deployment as action

2763
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,800
either keyboard typing or assisted

2764
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,560
typing technology

2765
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,719
or speaking as also a motor action

2766
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,960
it totally changes the game because

2767
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,880
we're not just in this forest of

2768
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,920
infinite plausible grammars but rather

2769
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,440
one realized and preferred action

2770
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,760
sequence and then of course thoughts are

2771
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,480
unobserved but the actions are not and

2772
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,080
there's that's the whole

2773
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,080
quantum reference frame and shared

2774
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,639
generative model and rhetorical nature

2775
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,520
narrative nature of cognition and so

2776
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,440
indeed the the action

2777
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,119
insight i think is going to be something

2778
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,280
that we'll keep returning to

2779
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,320
um

2780
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,639
we'll have a final

2781
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,119
closing the plane or whatever

2782
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,400
and um

2783
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,199
i'll also just

2784
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,280
give a little preview

2785
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,600
which is that next week

2786
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
we're going to be having a guest stream

2787
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,040
with adam

2788
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,159
so

2789
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,719
if it relates at all adam how does it

2790
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,159
relate

2791
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,920
what is the guest stream going to be

2792
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,679
about and then um

2793
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,199
perhaps in your absence what would be

2794
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:47,400
exciting to discuss in 42.2

2795
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,719
um

2796
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,480
oh you're right there is a guest stream

2797
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,480
um a quick thought though uh

2798
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,800
so like blue you were suggesting like

2799
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,480
daniel's notes could serve almost like a

2800
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,239
kind of memory palace

2801
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:03,840
and and

2802
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,679
accessible map and then dana you're

2803
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,440
saying it's more like a stigmatistic um

2804
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,040
mechanism for coordination like with

2805
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,199
pointing and cueing

2806
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,480
and that's interesting

2807
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,159
i wonder if like when people are reading

2808
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:20,480
books like the ability to like use the

2809
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,400
book as a like as a map slash palace

2810
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,760
like gives you better retention than

2811
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,280
something like a kindle

2812
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,199
like the book is like a physical object

2813
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:30,719
anyways so um oh yeah uh

2814
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,040
free will and so because for next week

2815
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,400
uh i would say that basically

2816
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,800
so so my like over hypothesis is that

2817
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,760
like

2818
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,239
all of the details or other

2819
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,320
that many of the details

2820
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,679
that tim is using for these systems will

2821
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,520
end up being

2822
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,719
relevant

2823
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,360
as abstract interpretations

2824
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,719
of the core

2825
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,560
um

2826
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,960
parameters of us as active inferential

2827
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,480
cybernetic systems

2828
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,520
both are with respect to basically the

2829
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,199
the basics of it lets us be in the world

2830
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,360
in a embodied way as uh

2831
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,040
as uh

2832
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:09,840
living

2833
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,360
living robots

2834
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,639
but um

2835
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,199
also in terms of their extension to um

2836
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,520
high level cognition scaling active

2837
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,320
inference to more complex domains

2838
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,040
and it's like in general like um

2839
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,040
you know i'm i'm trying to understand

2840
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,480
you know with

2841
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,960
limited success as many details as i can

2842
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,280
of tim's work because i i think it's

2843
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,119
just some of the most promising sources

2844
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,000
of like

2845
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
constraints we have on inference and

2846
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,280
interpretations and sources of

2847
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,880
hypotheses so

2848
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,960
basically whatever details tim is going

2849
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,119
to get into i think you'll be

2850
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:45,040
well well worthwhile to try to grock

2851
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,800
those and

2852
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,960
that's what i'm that's what i'm doing

2853
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,000
um

2854
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,600
in terms of next week

2855
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,760
so

2856
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,159
some of this is relevant and that um

2857
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,239
the basic idea would be that

2858
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,280
um

2859
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,840
these uh le bay phenomenon these studies

2860
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,600
in which people are seeing these

2861
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,679
slowly building potentials leading up to

2862
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:09,920
action that have predictive information

2863
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,360
but where they peak

2864
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,320
um

2865
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
in advance of people claiming that they

2866
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,119
have decided to take actions and where

2867
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,520
these studies are interpreted as

2868
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,800
evidence that people don't have free

2869
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,719
will we can get into

2870
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,560
you know all sorts of

2871
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,040
uh conversations about you know how we

2872
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,560
what makes how it makes sense to think

2873
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,679
free will in different ways whatever

2874
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,920
makes sense to talk about it all

2875
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,000
but that these studies are usually

2876
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,480
interpreted as saying that your

2877
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,679
um

2878
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,000
consciously experienced mental states

2879
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,920
cannot enter causal streams leading to

2880
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,040
action

2881
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,119
and so what i'm suggesting is that it's

2882
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:46,880
not the case and that there's multiple

2883
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,000
ways in which your subjective states are

2884
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,600
meaningfully causal

2885
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,600
if we think of what's leading up to

2886
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,679
something like deciding to move your

2887
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,159
hand in like a bad experiment

2888
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:01,520
if that is reflecting a buildup of model

2889
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,520
evidence over your proprioceptive pose

2890
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,080
or of you deciding to take that action

2891
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:06,880
um

2892
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,480
this kind of evidence accumulation if

2893
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,400
it's occurring via sophisticated effect

2894
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,600
of inference

2895
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,360
um that this would be a way of

2896
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,719
understanding it

2897
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,360
and that um part of what would influence

2898
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,440
how much buildup or not you get

2899
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,760
would be the specifics of

2900
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,560
this basically deep tree search

2901
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,560
from sophisticated and that we would

2902
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,840
might understand the sophisticated

2903
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,119
effect of inference

2904
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:30,960
as being orchestrated about hippocampal

2905
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,719
and enterorinal system

2906
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,719
as iterative mental stimulation where

2907
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,000
you're sampling out these different

2908
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,760
possibilities of

2909
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,280
what would it be like if i move my arm

2910
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,760
or not and then you're then evaluating

2911
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,280
that in your plant you're spinning

2912
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,080
peeling off these different

2913
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,679
counterfactuals

2914
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,679
and that if across these um you get

2915
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,080
enough um

2916
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,400
affective charge associated with going

2917
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,000
down some of these forks

2918
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,360
eventually this results in threshold

2919
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,440
crossing but the idea would be that so

2920
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,639
this would be relevant to some of the

2921
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:02,239
hippocampal

2922
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:05,360
slam work and that you can think of this

2923
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,719
uh imaginative planning stage leading up

2924
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,600
to even seemingly spontaneous actions

2925
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,800
you can think of this like a magic to

2926
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,679
face as being largely orchestrated

2927
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:16,400
by

2928
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,239
the hippocampal system which might be

2929
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,920
best understood as a

2930
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,080
general system for

2931
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,480
uh or a system for generalized foraging

2932
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,880
and mapping

2933
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,159
i don't know if that makes sense but

2934
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:30,320
that's like some of the connections well

2935
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,679
if you still want to come for the guest

2936
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:34,239
stream you're welcome to do so

2937
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,159
um no that thanks for the awesome

2938
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:37,760
summary and i know that we'll be able to

2939
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,800
unpack it a lot more next week um

2940
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,440
blue or steven what are some like last

2941
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,760
thoughts what was exciting

2942
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,520
or interesting to you in where we've

2943
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,920
been and where shall we forage next

2944
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,280
so i can go i i yeah i was really

2945
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,040
interested in taking this into like

2946
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,199
semantic space and i wonder what other

2947
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:01,679
kind of spaces that we can maybe

2948
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,840
think about mapping out um

2949
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,920
how we build how we construct maps

2950
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,840
cognitive space and so forth and i'm

2951
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,639
excited to um talk to tim about where

2952
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,639
where emergence fits into the

2953
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,360
hierarchical model

2954
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,400
awesome thank you blue steven

2955
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,639
yeah i think keeping the

2956
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:22,000
the idea of

2957
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,840
keeping things clean keeping things

2958
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,880
nascent

2959
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,719
and deflatory

2960
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,880
even in this case here is really

2961
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,199
something i think to continue looking at

2962
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,000
and i

2963
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,760
i'm really curious about what happens

2964
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,320
when we see that door

2965
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,239
and that door says you can go down that

2966
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:39,360
corridor

2967
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,480
am i going to go down into a different

2968
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,080
regime of attention am i going to stay

2969
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,800
where i am so i i think

2970
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,960
that that ability to

2971
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,000
take

2972
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
these principles

2973
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,840
and say okay what is it that happens

2974
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,400
when i encounter something and it

2975
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,000
triggers something

2976
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
how much is that

2977
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
significant in terms of making things

2978
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,040
happen and i'm curious then how that can

2979
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,880
marry with a lot of the

2980
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,280
mental space work that i do building out

2981
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,239
metaphor landscapes or actually letting

2982
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:14,719
someone explore

2983
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,320
spatially

2984
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,080
and one last thing actually that came up

2985
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,320
and someone said to me the other day is

2986
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,159
there's really curious why when he picks

2987
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:24,159
up his plastic pencil it doesn't mean as

2988
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:27,679
much to him as when he holds a shell

2989
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:28,960
so there's something about like when

2990
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,560
that door

2991
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,280
has got some prior there's something

2992
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,000
that you know about being in a woodland

2993
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,719
versus being somewhere which is dead

2994
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,199
and even that itself could explain a lot

2995
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:42,639
about

2996
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,679
how navigating those places the

2997
01:47:44,679 --> 01:47:46,800
eco-psychology of

2998
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,000
going into a wooded space a living place

2999
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,440
actually can be important for

3000
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,320
people

3001
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,480
in just in a wellness what might seem a

3002
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,800
very woo-woo

3003
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,800
type of stuff actually

3004
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,480
could be somehow linked to what we're

3005
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,239
talking about here so yeah brilliant

3006
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,480
thanks

3007
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,440
awesome

3008
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,960
yeah very

3009
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,440
exciting and fun

3010
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,760
discussion

3011
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,760
i really like that last piece which is

3012
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,280
what i know i'm gonna

3013
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,840
carry forward and hopefully reflect on

3014
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,440
next week

3015
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,320
how will we build that colony

3016
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,679
is it a memory palace blueprint

3017
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:30,840
is it stigmatic coordination but

3018
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,080
how and so somewhere between the

3019
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,840
um mental

3020
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
palace cathedral

3021
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
and the sort of picking up pebbles and

3022
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,360
having no bigger picture is where we are

3023
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:47,520
in our cognitive and social maps and so

3024
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,760
that's quite an area and

3025
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,000
adam the central complex modeling i

3026
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,520
can't wait

3027
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,560
so

3028
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,159
thank you all for joining thanks tim

3029
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:58,960
also so adam stephen and blue and sid
