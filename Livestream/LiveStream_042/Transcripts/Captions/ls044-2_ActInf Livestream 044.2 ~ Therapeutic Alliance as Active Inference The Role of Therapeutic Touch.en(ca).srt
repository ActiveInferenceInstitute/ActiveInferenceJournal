00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,072
Hello and welcome, everyone. It's ActInf

2
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:33,992
Lab Livestream number 44.2, and it's May

3
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:37,752
25, 2022. Welcome to the ActInf

4
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:41,016
lab. We're a participatory online lab

5
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,064
that is communicating, learning, and

6
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:45,268
practicing applied active inference.

7
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:46,984
You can find us at the links on this

8
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,336
slide. This is a recorded and an

9
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,304
archived Livestream, so please provide

10
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,490
feedback so we can improve our work.

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,936
All backgrounds and perspectives are

12
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,272
welcome, and we'll be following video

13
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:01,376
etiquette for live streams. If you want

14
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:03,616
to learn more about the live streams or

15
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:05,516
any other projects at Active

16
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:06,996
Inferencelab, check out

17
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:10,212
activeinference.org. Okay,

18
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:14,100
today in 44.2, we are in our third

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,404
discussion around the paper,

20
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:19,088
therapeutic alliance as Active Inference

21
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,936
the Role of Therapeutic Touch and

22
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,452
Synchrony from 2022 by the authors

23
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,716
listed here. And Ian and I had a dot

24
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,944
zero where we contextualized and went

25
00:01:29,982 --> 00:01:32,968
over some of the outline of the paper.

26
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,132
Then we had a great discussion last week

27
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,304
with several of the authors in the dot

28
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:40,588
one, and today we're here with some of

29
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:41,884
the authors, and we'll see who else

30
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:45,152
joins. And we'll be continuing that

31
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,888
discussion around the paper. We left a

32
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:50,416
few threads, but also we can just take

33
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,592
it wherever people would like to go.

34
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,668
And we'll begin just by saying hello.

35
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:58,756
People can say anything they want.

36
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:02,004
And how is this week different than last

37
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:04,596
week? How are we approaching this paper

38
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,964
differently? Or what would we like to

39
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,256
resolve or address in this two that

40
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,616
was stimulated by the dot one or that we

41
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,904
didn't get to in the one? Feel free to

42
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:19,876
add anything in that area. So, I'm

43
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,780
Daniel. I'm a researcher in California,

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,732
and one piece in the two

45
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:30,156
that I'd like to explore would be what

46
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:33,404
are the entities that we're discussing

47
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,784
here at what scales, and how to think

48
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,684
about that in terms of their generative

49
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:42,160
model and so on. And I'll pass to Ian.

50
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,352
Hello. Thank you, Daniel. And yes,

51
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:55,904
I would like to maybe pick

52
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,544
up on if we've got time on the topic of

53
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:01,908
synchrony this week and what types of

54
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,052
synchrony might we be talking about?

55
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:07,636
What things might be oscillating that

56
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:12,004
come into sort of phase lock between two

57
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,376
agents that have the potential to

58
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:17,816
synchronize and then where do they

59
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:20,696
head towards with their synchrony? And

60
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,816
then if we've got time, thinking about

61
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:27,820
tying this all back to some of the core

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,204
ideas about minimizing free energy and

63
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:35,304
what does that mean in a therapeutic

64
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,060
setting?

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,170
Yes. That's it, I think. Thank you.

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,524
Awesome. All right, any of the authors,

67
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,050
feel free to go for it.

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,670
Zoe, play this first.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,636
Okay, so I'm George. I'm one of the

70
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,164
authors on this paper. I'm an osteopath

71
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:09,304
and researcher. And where

72
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,384
do I see this going forward? I pretty

73
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,912
much enjoyed the interaction we had last

74
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,452
week and very happy to kind of be left

75
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:20,540
by you guys, Ian and Daniel, and anybody

76
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,420
else that want to join. I think we can

77
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,470
definitely explore those ideas about the

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,260
synchronization to agents, and arguably

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,096
more than two agents when we operate in

80
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:36,976
a kind of not in a diadic setting, but

81
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:38,496
actually in a triadic setting. For

82
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:42,076
example, pediatric care, kind of elderly

83
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:45,556
care and so on, actually, there's an

84
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,372
additional agent in the whole thing.

85
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:51,764
So what do I look forward to? The

86
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:55,544
discussion kind of stimulate some

87
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,944
ideas about ways in which we can move

88
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:00,980
forward with this to the more empirical

89
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,650
state of the research.

90
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,950
Great. Zoe.

91
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,942
Hi, I'm Zoe. I'm an Osteopath as well,

92
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:14,882
based in Singapore, and I'm the primary

93
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:18,406
author for this paper. Yeah, happy to be

94
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,806
led by anyone that wants to where we

95
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,586
want to go, but definitely happy to talk

96
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,614
about synchrony. I think, as George

97
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:25,994
said, it would be important to talk

98
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:28,666
about not just diadic, but triadic or

99
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:32,078
otherwise, because I think that adds a

100
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:35,182
lot of depth to it. But also

101
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:38,510
it's easier to sort of discuss the

102
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,214
effects of synchrony and also the fact

103
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,560
that you can be.

104
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,880
Okay, lost Zoe for a second.

105
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,966
Anyone that wants to ask questions.

106
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,950
Okay. Also, Zoe, is there, like, any

107
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,546
other microphone to use, or could you

108
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,130
speak closer to the microphone?

109
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,966
I'm just using my laptop, so there isn't

110
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,106
really a microphone. I can take my

111
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,458
headphones off if that makes a

112
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,378
difference. It's fine. It's just a

113
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,900
little quiet, but it's fine.

114
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,206
Okay. Sorry. Oh, no, it's totally all

115
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,814
good. Just want us to check. Okay. All

116
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:26,326
right. Let us pick up with the synchrony

117
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:29,866
then. So I guess just to kind of

118
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:33,114
recall, how was this question of

119
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:36,378
synchrony approached in the active

120
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,454
inference literature and maybe even

121
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,666
outside of the active inference

122
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,746
literature, and then how was synchrony

123
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,822
approached in this paper? Why was that

124
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:49,550
such a core topic in this approach

125
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,860
that the authors took?

126
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,026
I think we started with synchrony as the

127
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:02,558
main part, mainly because when

128
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:04,226
we were talking about the therapeutic

129
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,094
alliance, synchrony and getting on with

130
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,006
the other person is kind of key. And the

131
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,830
way that we approached this paper,

132
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,026
primarily in terms of a lot of the

133
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,202
aspects of how we achieved that good

134
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:18,010
therapeutic alliance was through

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,540
synchrony. So that's kind of where

136
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,926
that's one of the reasons through active

137
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:28,320
inference. It was also about

138
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,142
I started the research when I was

139
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:34,462
looking at it right from sort of the

140
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:38,410
start and looking at how communication

141
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,346
worked and why people would want to sort

142
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:43,700
of synchronize together and why people

143
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,866
to implement active inference into sort

144
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:49,490
of the structure that we had. It was

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,726
important to kind of see why that would

146
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,174
be beneficial because we wanted to use

147
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,514
or we like to say that the synchrony

148
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:01,398
enables us to work together to then

149
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,714
therefore save free energy, be more

150
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:09,226
efficient, and then that's how we

151
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:12,006
very much used it to apply this active

152
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,878
inference sort of framework around

153
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:20,606
it. And so I felt that it

154
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,386
was very key without the synchrony

155
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,650
element. It was kind of the backbone

156
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,054
into which a lot of the aspects of

157
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,766
active inference in the way that we

158
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:32,546
achieve therapeutic alliance seemed to

159
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,426
sort of center around. Without that

160
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,780
connection between the different people,

161
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,806
we wouldn't be able to save energy to

162
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,862
work together, to have a better

163
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,550
relationship with our practitioners,

164
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,646
with the patients and practitioner. We

165
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,942
wouldn't be able to get the clinical

166
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:55,930
applications and benefits from it.

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,820
So I saw synchrony as sort of the key

168
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,994
medal to sort of get to where

169
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,702
the sort of paper was. So it was sort of

170
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:10,654
a key concept to

171
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,638
use in order to implement it all

172
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,870
together. George.

173
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,282
Yeah, let's say when we started

174
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:24,274
the project actually kind of putting

175
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:28,034
some ideas along the lines of how could

176
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:32,086
we apply predictive processing and

177
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:36,310
the free energy active inference within

178
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,042
osteopathy and within the osteopathic

179
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,502
setting. Synchrony came along actually

180
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:46,306
after the initial discussion

181
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,566
with Karl Frieston that kind of

182
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,962
suggested know look into this stuff

183
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,982
because actually could be quite a robust

184
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:58,842
way of understanding what

185
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,026
goes on in the clinic room when two

186
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,634
people are working together with a

187
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,060
specific kind of aim. There is

188
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,122
a little bit of literature in

189
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,826
psychotherapy kind of demonstrating that

190
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,810
actually the therapeutic alliance

191
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,474
becomes much more robust when two people

192
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:25,046
synchronize and both at the kind

193
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:30,002
of behavioral but also biological

194
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,594
level. And it was nothing about sort of

195
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,766
okay, this is about pure verbal

196
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:39,062
communication, nonverbal but primarily

197
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,226
by kind of copying body movements and so

198
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:44,794
on to think, okay, how can this

199
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:48,154
be applied in the context of actually an

200
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:50,826
approach that is largely hands on based

201
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:54,046
as a manual therapy? So that's where it

202
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:59,170
kind of started from. It was one way of

203
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,114
trying, like Zoe said, kind of looking

204
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,450
at therapeutic alliance when people

205
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,506
interact to try and understand what goes

206
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,354
on in the diadic setting. Kind of two

207
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:13,806
people but also a little bit beyond of

208
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:16,006
what happens when there's actually more

209
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:17,714
people involved in that therapeutic

210
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:20,194
relationship that need to be consulted,

211
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:22,454
need to be involved in the process and

212
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:23,240
so on.

213
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,170
That was the kind of early stage.

214
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,346
And then we thought that actually this

215
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:36,918
is a good way of understanding a

216
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:39,614
little bit more about how we can create

217
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,238
the conditions of developing a strong

218
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:45,502
kind of ecological niche that is based

219
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,246
on that synchrony of that sort of

220
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,650
understanding of that give and take.

221
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,442
Like a little bit like we talked about

222
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,046
last week, the kind of the Bird song.

223
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,514
People taking turns, kind of

224
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,582
understanding, listening, okay, acting

225
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,598
kind of taking on, go back and so on.

226
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,880
And that's sort of, in a sense, like

227
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,654
kind of a nice wave that goes back and

228
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,470
forth. But it is a kind of very nice and

229
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,618
tranquil kind of wave. Not a one that

230
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,242
just crashes and destroys everything,

231
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:18,474
but actually one where once that kind of

232
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,982
goes on a little bit like the pendulum

233
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:24,522
kind of analogy once you introduce that

234
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,626
nice pendulum kind of things happen.

235
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,214
That's where we sort of thought it could

236
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,094
be one way of exploring the whole

237
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,360
process of care.

238
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,310
Thank you, Ian.

239
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,200
Thank you.

240
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,494
I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony

241
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:51,190
and the little bits I've read in the

242
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,282
literature about how measurable

243
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,858
things that might be able to synchronize

244
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,262
between one or two or more people.

245
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,174
So, Daniel, I think we discussed this in

246
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:07,382
the zero. So choirs

247
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:10,598
singing together, they have been shown

248
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,526
their heart rates kind of synchronize

249
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:14,970
with their breathing.

250
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,566
And I think in the paper there was some

251
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,566
references cited for similar sort of

252
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:24,350
stuff in drumming circles, for example.

253
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,414
So that really interests me and I can

254
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:28,786
kind of begin to see how in a

255
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,146
therapeutic setting, that kind of

256
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:33,170
synchrony could lead someone who's maybe

257
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,620
stressed and anxious into a kind of more

258
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,254
healthy increased parasympathetic

259
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,786
activity and that is conducive to

260
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:46,306
healing. But I've also got

261
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,002
these other sort of nagging things about

262
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:51,906
synchrony as well that maybe

263
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,498
I touched on the dot zero,

264
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,966
which is what are we synchronizing

265
00:13:56,998 --> 00:14:03,670
towards and is it always beneficial?

266
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,386
So the

267
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:09,806
less kind of lockstep synchrony that you

268
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:12,458
talked about, Daniel. So maybe it's

269
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:15,258
just, let's say a child saying, mummy,

270
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:16,574
mummy, mummy, waving their arms around

271
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,046
and then the mum synchronize, they

272
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,710
synchronize their attention together.

273
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,114
So you get mother and child and then

274
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,874
you've got a choice. So there's some

275
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,498
aspect that's synchronized. I think in

276
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,994
the paper it talked about the arms and

277
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,126
the limbs and the voice kind of

278
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:34,434
synchronizing and the facial

279
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:38,406
expressions. But a

280
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,286
caregiver might then lead the child to a

281
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,942
soothing kind of parasympathetic way

282
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:46,998
soothe it. Or it might say, give it a

283
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,066
clip behind the ear and say, children us

284
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,442
to be seen and not heard and try and

285
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,746
stop the attention. The attention is

286
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:59,274
synchronized, but the action may

287
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,690
not be therapeutic.

288
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,060
Yeah, I'm just sort of thinking about

289
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,562
where you know, where just because

290
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,962
something's synchronized, does it mean

291
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:16,562
it's always minimizing free energy or

292
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,706
just because things

293
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:23,138
in the therapeutic world go in and out

294
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:26,022
of fashion? So frontal lobotomy is okay,

295
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,878
we don't do that anymore. But for a

296
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,574
while there was some kind of

297
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,506
synchronized thinking in the therapeutic

298
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,026
world that that's a good idea for

299
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:36,106
people. And there

300
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:39,706
are ideas that I hear in the wider kind

301
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:42,330
of therapy world that are fashionable

302
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,102
and they're being applied, but in

303
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,206
50 years time we may look that they may

304
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:54,446
have been leading people away from

305
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:56,762
minimizing free energy or improving

306
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:57,440
health.

307
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,106
My thoughts. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, a lot

308
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,250
there. George.

309
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,140
I think the interesting thing,

310
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,614
there are nagging questions there for

311
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:16,070
sure. The first one, do we always

312
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,818
synchronize and when if you don't

313
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,502
synchronize what we're going to do,

314
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:23,914
because clearly there are cases where we

315
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,834
know the therapeutic relationship is

316
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:29,386
going nowhere. We can say whatever we

317
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:31,580
can, try our best, but actually,

318
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,226
there is resistance to change from the

319
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:38,026
patients. We end up not understanding

320
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:41,034
each other. And arguably,

321
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,118
that's a relationship that will not

322
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,206
evolve. And, well, you might even get to

323
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,726
a point at the end. Maybe it'd be a good

324
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:49,306
idea to go and see a colleague of mine

325
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:52,034
kind of thing. Okay, so do we

326
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,094
synchronize with everybody? No, clearly

327
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:58,126
not. Is there any value understanding

328
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,574
this stuff by sometimes understanding

329
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,814
that some kind of gestures and sort of

330
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,720
body language and so on,

331
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,458
voice, sound, sort of communication

332
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:13,410
style, we're probably giving us cues

333
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,586
maybe to adapt a little bit to try and

334
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:18,938
synchronize a little bit better. I think

335
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:21,834
that's useful. I think important in

336
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,650
order to be a good communicator. I think

337
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,090
first and foremost, sometimes people

338
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,802
worry too much about the technical

339
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,302
skills and the ability of doing X and Y

340
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:34,878
and doing some miracles and so on.

341
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,214
Arguably the first thing that people

342
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,314
need to be in a clinical setting is good

343
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:41,682
communicator and a pretty good, nice

344
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,206
person. Okay? And I think if that's

345
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:47,566
there, I think we create the conditions

346
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:50,946
in good communicators likely to have

347
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,982
potentially better outcomes that guys

348
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,718
that basically don't care and sort of

349
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:58,454
they're the experts and so on. The other

350
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,262
question is, is it always about

351
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:02,486
minimizing free energy? Because there

352
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:06,182
are situations where

353
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,186
probably you want to short circuit the

354
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,186
whole thing, isn't it? You want to sort

355
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,394
of flatten a little bit of that sort of

356
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:15,034
sensory state. You want to create a

357
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:20,046
condition where the only way you

358
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,310
can sort of change the generative model

359
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,482
is actually by creating a massive

360
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,118
surprise, a massive prediction error

361
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,898
that arguably surprises the system in a

362
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:34,002
way like, wow, what just happened? And

363
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:37,346
actually, oh, okay, I don't

364
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:38,962
think it's always about minimizing free

365
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:42,326
energy, but sometimes I think you want

366
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:44,326
to shock the whole thing because the

367
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:45,718
system on the other side wants to

368
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,880
minimize free energy for sure.

369
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,682
If I'm a kind of chronic pain patient

370
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:55,306
and I'm scared of moving and you tell me

371
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:58,074
to move and so on, the reaction is I

372
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:01,254
anticipate the likelihood of movement

373
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:03,386
leading to pain. I anticipate the

374
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,050
consequences of actions in the future,

375
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,254
the typical active inference model.

376
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,502
And I lock, I don't move. So I probably

377
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:14,174
want to short circuit the whole thing to

378
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,542
create a condition where it's actually

379
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,738
okay to move because it's not going to

380
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:22,930
cause any harm, is it,

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,354
through synchrony? Maybe it

382
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,810
isn't. Okay, so I think that's not,

383
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,510
I think, a kind of one size fits all

384
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,986
kind of thing. And I don't think it's

385
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,894
just about sort of always that

386
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:40,120
minimizing free energy because I think

387
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,642
creating change that is meaningful

388
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:45,606
change probably needs a little bit more

389
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:49,010
of it

390
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,002
needs to destroy that sort of strong

391
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:55,142
prior kind of thing so I can implant

392
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,702
another chip kind of thing in a

393
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:02,494
metaphorical way. And that's why we

394
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,194
know in some mental health conditions

395
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:07,754
why some types of drugs like catamine

396
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:10,560
and so on, create that condition that

397
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,274
sort of zeros. The whole thing is a bit

398
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,986
like you reset the button, isn't it?

399
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,338
The computer is stuck. What you do,

400
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,354
you've tried everything. You unplug the

401
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,178
computer and then you try again. The

402
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,986
whole thing reboots, isn't it? So I

403
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,482
think sometimes that's the analogy of

404
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,394
maybe what we want to achieve in the

405
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,642
setting is it through synchrony? I

406
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:34,906
personally, I don't know, and I'm not

407
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:38,698
entirely sure. Of course, if the people

408
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,434
started understanding each other, then

409
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,954
that creates the conditions for this

410
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,658
thing probably to happen. Because if you

411
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,126
don't understand me as a practitioner,

412
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,614
I don't understand you as a patient,

413
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:51,822
it's pretty hard that actually I create

414
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,386
the condition for change. So maybe it's

415
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,014
through synchrony, but again, as a sort

416
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,000
of big question marks, really.

417
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,180
Thanks. Yes. Zoe, please.

418
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,562
Yeah, so I think going off what I

419
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,466
mean, overall, the goal would be to

420
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,974
minimize free energy. But to be able to

421
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,406
do that, you have to sort of at some

422
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,326
point challenge it, right? You're not

423
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,646
going to have the same belief that you

424
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:25,446
think is the most efficient. When you're

425
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,874
born to when you die, the way

426
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,326
that you become reduced

427
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,746
energy is going to change over time.

428
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,586
You'll see that especially in sort of

429
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,810
pediatrics. You see it in sport.

430
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,990
There's a lot of studies with running,

431
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,454
for example, that show that the more you

432
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:46,414
run, often the more mileage that people

433
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:47,754
do when they run, the more efficient

434
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:51,360
they get. So I think free energy is,

435
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,426
yes, we all want to reduce it, but at

436
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,122
some point we've got to update it and

437
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,858
challenge it, right? So it won't be sort

438
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:59,886
of just this linear thing where you're

439
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,418
constantly just changing it. You've got

440
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,874
to update it and challenge it at some

441
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,446
point. So it will sort of be a little

442
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:08,150
bit of a roller coaster and have a few

443
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,446
dips where you got to take that risk to

444
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:13,546
see if there's another way that is more

445
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:16,220
efficient, that will save it more.

446
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,630
Whether synchrony is always necessary,

447
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,794
I'm not sure. I definitely think that

448
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:28,634
when you're unsure whether or

449
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,118
if your prior is not so precise and

450
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,566
you're not 100% sure that that is the

451
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,742
best way to do whatever you're doing,

452
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:38,302
or you're not 100% certain that your

453
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,458
belief explains what's going on, then I

454
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,894
think you're more likely to synchronize

455
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:46,242
with others. I think once you're quite

456
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,722
certain on what you think and what

457
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,254
you're going to do, then it's a lot

458
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,742
harder to synchronize. Like with

459
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:57,046
the cognitive sort of immunity when

460
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,406
you've got chronic pain, it's a lot

461
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:01,218
harder to change that because you're

462
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:03,706
convinced that you're right. You've had

463
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:07,114
this pain for years, maybe, and you know

464
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,162
what it's like. If you bend forward,

465
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:11,322
it's going to hurt. So why would you

466
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:12,940
bother to challenge that?

467
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,854
I think there's a lot of studies that

468
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:19,326
show that, especially with sort of

469
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:22,320
babies, that they synchronize with their

470
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,094
when they're younger the synchrony is

471
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,886
very consistent. Obviously they need to

472
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:32,782
work with their caregiver to get their

473
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,218
alleystatic needs and everything that

474
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,314
they need to keep surviving. But it

475
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:39,474
shows that they do still think when

476
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:42,114
they're adults but the time when they're

477
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:45,110
older or in adulthood that they do think

478
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,958
is when they're unsure. When something

479
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:50,194
happens and you are near that caregiver

480
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:53,720
and you don't know, you still sort of

481
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,986
rely on them. Say I don't know, you get

482
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,514
into a car accident or something and

483
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:01,402
there's a big shock and you're not sure.

484
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,314
Often the child will still, no matter

485
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,206
how old they are, will look to the

486
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:10,046
parent, obviously unless the parent is

487
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:12,286
very elderly. But generally speaking in

488
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:14,014
times of uncertainty you will look

489
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,606
towards someone else. So I think is

490
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:20,846
synchrony always necessary? No but I

491
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:23,986
think if you're not 100% certain with

492
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:26,098
your priors and you are questioning it

493
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:28,846
or there is a doubt of that questioning

494
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:31,480
it, then I think synchrony will play

495
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,666
more of a role in it and I'll

496
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:38,966
pass it back to you. Awesome, thanks.

497
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,278
Yeah, just thinking about beliefs in the

498
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:44,714
way that we might talk about them. Hey,

499
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:46,666
blue. Welcome. Just the way that we

500
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,154
might conversationally talk about

501
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,634
beliefs. If somebody is unsure about

502
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,114
something that's when they look to be

503
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:55,686
synchronized by some other informational

504
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:57,546
resource. I'm not sure what time this

505
00:24:57,568 --> 00:24:59,594
thing opens so I'm going to look it up

506
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,054
in this way or I'm going to ask this

507
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,806
person or I'm not sure where to go so

508
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,854
I'm going to follow the crowd. We see

509
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:08,486
that kind of in the ant pheromone trail,

510
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:11,426
we see that in the social media, all

511
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,866
these different areas. And then

512
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,874
conversely when somebody does have a

513
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:20,180
more confident, more built up prior then

514
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,062
that's more like going their own way and

515
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:26,310
potentially being more resistant to

516
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,366
external contrasting information and

517
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:32,134
then translating from that one

518
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,954
conversational meaning of belief like I

519
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,634
believe that is going to open at this

520
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:40,886
time into a broader Bayesian perspective

521
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:44,890
on Bayesian brain and body and thinking

522
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,454
about pain and perception as also

523
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:53,818
parameters that can be seen as beliefs

524
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,382
in this Bayesian sense. So not always

525
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:59,246
like a psychological experienced belief

526
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,938
but in some statistical way it's like

527
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:06,046
they're held stances that are updated

528
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:08,866
in some way or partially or completely

529
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,894
by certain kinds of incoming

530
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:14,086
information. So Ian and then also this

531
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,486
is going to be I think very interesting

532
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,950
to return to the free energy

533
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,606
minimization and unpack what we mean by

534
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,960
free energy there. So Ian. Go for.

535
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,386
Thanks. So, yeah, I'm just sort of

536
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,066
wanting to check that some of

537
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,894
the language used in other realms of

538
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,746
therapy. So this idea of self regulation

539
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:42,302
and co regulation, are we saying

540
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:45,438
here that this synchrony in the

541
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,614
therapeutic reliance is a form of co

542
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:51,410
regulation that we hear a lot about

543
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,810
in people with disorder

544
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,366
problems of their autonomic nervous

545
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,158
system? And then we say, you go to a

546
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:05,686
therapist to help co regulate your

547
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,590
autonomic nervous system. Is that what

548
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,686
we're saying as synchrony is the kind of

549
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:13,618
mechanism for co regulation which

550
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:16,554
I believe fits with what you're saying,

551
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,746
zoe that children need that more and as

552
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,210
adults we might do that occasionally.

553
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,714
And then I'm just thinking also other

554
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,754
forms of therapeutic synchrony and co

555
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:33,274
regulation. So meeting friends for a you

556
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:34,846
know, I might be having a bit of a

557
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:38,458
stressful week or a

558
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,674
wobble in some way, and then I meet some

559
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:44,446
friends and we kind of seek

560
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:46,226
counsel in each other, have a

561
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,554
synchronize our movement of our hands to

562
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:52,166
our mouth with a coffee cup or listen to

563
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,746
some music together, tap our feet

564
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:55,880
together. And that's a kind of

565
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,934
therapeutic. So are we all kind of doing

566
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,680
this on and off all the time?

567
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,780
They're my thoughts or questions.

568
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,570
Yes. George zoe, then? George.

569
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,210
Yeah. No, I just wanted to say yes.

570
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,334
With the co regulation. I think that we

571
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:24,062
kind of not always but I think

572
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:26,442
we do add an element to try and suggest

573
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:30,222
that we'd like to say that we in part

574
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:34,002
help co regulation and as

575
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,034
a practitioner to achieve sort of

576
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:39,842
recovery and reduce pain and

577
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:42,886
help. I think we all want to say that we

578
00:28:42,908 --> 00:28:44,982
help in that process and that we help

579
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:47,042
regulate their sort of disruptive

580
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,770
pattern, whether that's inflammation,

581
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,974
whether that's pain, whatever sort of

582
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:57,740
metric that you want to rate

583
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,994
your treatment by or whatever your

584
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,546
treatment goals are that you're sort of

585
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,226
working towards. I think we all want to

586
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:06,590
say that we sort of help regulate

587
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,726
which ways we regulate in terms of

588
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,862
whether we actually

589
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,886
change their heart rate or things like

590
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:19,602
that. We're not always so

591
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:21,826
specific about we don't have the

592
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:24,722
research to kind of show that. But I

593
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:27,234
think certainly there is elements of

594
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:29,282
sympathetic and parasympathetic things

595
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:32,214
that we do, as well as sort of the

596
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:35,458
intent to co regulate even if we don't

597
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:39,398
sort of empirically do it or

598
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:41,974
achieve it. Whether just that

599
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,842
reassurance that we're attempting to

600
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:48,460
help regulate their pain,

601
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,426
I think is sort of the intention that I

602
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:55,822
hope that as a practitioner I am giving

603
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:59,114
off to my patients and I'll let George

604
00:29:59,242 --> 00:29:59,920
speak.

605
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,378
I think if

606
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:11,134
you come from a manual therapy

607
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:13,314
background, a touch based, hands on

608
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:17,058
approach, one could argue, or old school

609
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:19,070
kind of beliefs in the profession,

610
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,814
christian Osteopathy would argue that

611
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:25,266
actually how you achieve that core

612
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:28,518
regulation, autonomic nervous system,

613
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:30,994
sympathetic parasympathetic is primarily

614
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,386
through the use of techniques. You use a

615
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:34,986
technique in a particular part of the

616
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,106
body and this affects the

617
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,814
parasympathetic part and so on the vagus

618
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:44,314
nerve and all that stuff that sort of

619
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,806
implies there is a tool by which you

620
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,374
can apply that stuff, treat that

621
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:52,314
particular bit and by miracle modulate

622
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:54,926
everything. I used to be there, no

623
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:58,666
longer there because the evidence isn't

624
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:00,994
strong enough to actually support those

625
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:03,554
clients on the other hand, if we add

626
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,902
another element, which is the element

627
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:08,866
the synchrony. And the synchrony here

628
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,430
goes beyond just that sort of passive

629
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,058
practitioner led type of intervention

630
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:17,314
into something that implies

631
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:21,270
communication, implies alignment

632
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,854
attuning to the environment. And the

633
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:26,954
environment there is the practitioner as

634
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,354
well. So the other person in the room,

635
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,594
the guy that is facilitating the

636
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,498
process. So it sort of takes us, I

637
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:36,122
think, away from this idea that

638
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,062
everything is about touches, everything

639
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,174
is about the manual stuff and so on.

640
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,274
But it becomes a kind of a multipronged

641
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:45,502
approach where touch matters, that

642
00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:48,446
communication matters as much as touch.

643
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,030
And it's not a technique X, Y or NZ,

644
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,706
but it's actually the whole package of

645
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:56,162
care that's likely to enable us to get

646
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:59,620
there. So is it similar

647
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,494
I like your analogy to sort of tough day

648
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,574
and so on. You go out, you need to see

649
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:07,206
your friends, you need to synchronize in

650
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,710
a different environment because

651
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,246
ultimately people will talk to

652
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:14,546
each other and correlate regulate each

653
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:16,374
other even in terms of reducing

654
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:19,114
allostatic load of a tough week and so

655
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:23,002
on. There are kind of things that are

656
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:24,774
similar to what happens in the clinical

657
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:26,822
setting. One of them, we're probably

658
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:29,360
thinking about reward systems as well.

659
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,726
There's a sort of a participation in

660
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:34,574
something that is likely to, even if

661
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:36,574
uncomfortable, is let is going to lead

662
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:40,550
to some improvement. Maybe there's

663
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,866
some dopamine stuff, maybe there is a

664
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:45,314
reward pathways that are kind of

665
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:46,834
involved in the whole thing, like having

666
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:49,326
a drink in the same having a therapeutic

667
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:52,886
intervention that ultimately is going to

668
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:56,786
get me to a better state. I think it's

669
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,558
very analogous to moving away from the

670
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,622
free energy principle and to an area

671
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:05,130
that kind of works

672
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,370
alongside that inactivism,

673
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,140
the concept of sense making,

674
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,678
what inactivists would argue

675
00:33:16,774 --> 00:33:20,634
participatory sense making. So synchrony

676
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:23,774
could be kind of also looked from that

677
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:26,526
lens, from that perspective. Whereas two

678
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,026
people or more than two people either in

679
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,946
a group having a drink and all kind of

680
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,874
helping each other because I listen, or

681
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:36,466
in a therapeutic setting that sort of

682
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:39,486
participatory things, making minimizing

683
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,806
free energy or autopoeasies for the kind

684
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:47,894
of the inactivists. Actually, I think we

685
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:50,834
sort of looking at the same phenomena,

686
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,694
maybe with different language, but

687
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:56,026
arguably the same kind of phenomena. I

688
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:59,626
think it's that package that probably

689
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:02,140
helps core regulation rather than just

690
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,800
one intervention. Thank you,

691
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,086
Blue. Welcome. Do you want

692
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:14,000
to add anything or ask anything?

693
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,666
Not right off the bat, just hi, it's

694
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:20,254
nice to be here with you guys. I'm sorry

695
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,874
I missed last week and I've really

696
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,794
enjoyed the discussions of the paper so

697
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,754
far. And I'll jump in, in a little bit.

698
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:29,266
I think you guys were engrossed in a

699
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:32,550
good conversation. Okay,

700
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,374
awesome. So the Dopamine angle and a few

701
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:38,726
other things we'll return to. But we

702
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:40,854
were talking about minimizing free

703
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:45,142
energy and I wanted to show a few images

704
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:49,034
from the textbook because even those

705
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,258
who have seen free energy come up in a

706
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,066
lot of different settings, sometimes

707
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:56,982
returning to the basics is a generator

708
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:58,654
that helps us take it in many other

709
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:01,582
ways. And for those who are maybe

710
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,366
focused more on the clinical setting or

711
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:07,214
have more of that background, this can

712
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:11,230
provide a little other tissues

713
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,754
around the connective tissue. Free

714
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,654
energy is being used like a connective

715
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,818
tissue here. It's bridging a lot of

716
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,802
different ideas. It's helping us connect

717
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:20,574
different sensory modalities and

718
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:23,720
therapeutic modalities. So just a few

719
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,226
cool images from the active inference

720
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:29,800
textbook. So here is Figure

721
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,006
2.3 and it's the action perception

722
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:37,750
loop and the two ways that discrepancies

723
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,358
related to predictions or expectations,

724
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,538
the two ways that discrepancies about

725
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:46,750
observations can be reduced just

726
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,402
qualitatively is through changing belief

727
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:53,034
and changing action. And it's some blend

728
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,626
of those two that individual entities

729
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,786
are engaged in in this action perception

730
00:35:57,818 --> 00:36:00,974
loop. And then when we're specifically

731
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:04,290
talking about free energy, there's some

732
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,530
type of equation,

733
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,638
this is like a simple form of it that

734
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:15,010
is going to make that discrepancy

735
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,062
minimization tractable and possible

736
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,726
to calculate for at

737
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,890
least us doing statistics from outside

738
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,418
the system, if not for the system itself

739
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:31,322
to do. And what is the real

740
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,902
sort of hidden goal?

741
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:37,898
Is this minimization of true surprise.

742
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:41,518
But the minimization of true surprise is

743
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:44,718
intractable or it's inaccessible. And so

744
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:47,274
free energy serves as like this upper

745
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:50,802
bound. Whereas if we can reduce this

746
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:53,614
upper bound, we're getting implicitly

747
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:57,294
closer to this asymptotic

748
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:01,894
reduction of surprise. So who

749
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:04,214
is doing this reduction of surprise that

750
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:07,622
relates to the entity question

751
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:09,942
what is the entity that's actually doing

752
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:14,506
free energy minimization? And so what

753
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:16,202
are the entities that we're talking

754
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:20,522
about here? What does it mean to

755
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:22,060
minimize free energy?

756
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,386
I liked how earlier it was brought up

757
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:28,782
when sometimes where that free energy

758
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:30,958
minimization was going with the flow and

759
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:33,226
then sometimes when there was a flow

760
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,630
disrupt. So what is free energy

761
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,710
minimization and what are the entities

762
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,578
and how are we modeling that? Ian and

763
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:41,860
then anyone else?

764
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,146
Thanks. Yeah, that question of what are

765
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,398
the entities and linking it back to

766
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:55,094
George's point about sense making and

767
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:59,126
inactivism. So in the paper there

768
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:01,560
was some really interesting stuff on

769
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,186
realizing that we're all alike in

770
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:12,294
the therapeutic alliance and relating

771
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:15,882
that back to sense making. I'm thinking

772
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:19,086
that therapeutically or in

773
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:21,920
a manual therapy or meeting friends,

774
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,078
the outcome might be I'm not a

775
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,962
weirdo, I haven't done anything wrong,

776
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,254
everything's okay. Again, I'm relaxed

777
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:36,398
and that's therapeutic. So I'm amongst

778
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,346
people who are very much alike me. And

779
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:40,838
that's the sense making. There's the

780
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,634
pattern recognition. I'm a valuable

781
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,526
member of my tribe, however you want to

782
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:46,600
describe it.

783
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,470
But we're never completely identical.

784
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,720
Or are we? I don't know.

785
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,646
The proposal in the paper is that that's

786
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:04,314
the ultimate realization that we're all

787
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:05,966
alike. And I can kind of see. That

788
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:08,094
that's a kind of relieving thing to

789
00:39:08,132 --> 00:39:12,080
realize. But we're similar.

790
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,938
I'm similar to my pet dog in that I've

791
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,314
got eyes and I breathe and my heart

792
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:21,762
beats and I can synchronize in some ways

793
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:23,922
with that, and it feels nice, but my dog

794
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:26,786
can't help me do my accounts, for

795
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:29,380
example. So,

796
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,706
yes, this alikeness. And how

797
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:36,420
does that fit into sense making?

798
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,142
Thanks, Blue. So, as I've been reading

799
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:44,394
the textbook, I've been thinking a lot

800
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,502
about the hidden states. And it's

801
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:48,250
interesting to think about that in terms

802
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,254
of using touch to kind of resolve

803
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,740
uncertainty about the hidden states.

804
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,666
Because while a state might be hidden to

805
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:59,770
the patient, when you present with some,

806
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,774
like, I've got a pain in my shoulder or

807
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:04,462
something like that, it might be easy

808
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:06,442
for the therapist to say, oh, that's

809
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:08,026
this, this, and I push here and tweak

810
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,620
this, and then it's better.

811
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,546
So it might be hidden to the patient but

812
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,626
not hidden to the doctor, or hidden to

813
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:17,860
the doctor and the patient, or hidden to

814
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,138
the patient but not the doctor, or the

815
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:22,946
doctor but not the patient. So it might

816
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:24,546
be like all of these things. And so it's

817
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:26,198
like working together, this kind of

818
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,838
synchrony to resolve uncertainty about a

819
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,646
hidden state. And I've thought a lot

820
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,814
about who's making the observation and

821
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:37,066
who's doing the state observing and who

822
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,206
is the state hidden to. And it brings

823
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:41,274
back the paper that you guys mentioned

824
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:44,006
in the zero the communication as active

825
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:45,966
inference because it really is like a bi

826
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,630
directional, harmonious kind of thing

827
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,278
happening. Right. Awesome. Thanks.

828
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:55,550
Yes. George.

829
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,658
Yeah. So actually,

830
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,246
starting with the hidden states, who's

831
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:10,580
observing, who's been observed? I think

832
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,126
the free energy model or picture the

833
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:17,782
typical representation with the two

834
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:21,558
agents and or one agent in the world and

835
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:24,258
internal states, external states and so

836
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:27,046
on. If you have the two agents, there's

837
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:29,386
something in the middle that clearly is

838
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:32,954
the ground where we kind of try

839
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,906
to achieve some form of alignment. And

840
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:38,894
then that sort of implies the

841
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:42,362
reading of someone else's internal

842
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:46,046
state, I think, who makes the

843
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:48,286
observation, who's been observed and so

844
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:51,538
on. I think, again, is the birdsong is a

845
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:53,934
give and take because there are clearly

846
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:57,234
situations where you may be telling your

847
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:58,786
patient that actually is nothing to

848
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,746
worry about, for example, where you're

849
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,774
not particularly sure about what's going

850
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:07,926
on and the patient can clearly read in

851
00:42:07,948 --> 00:42:12,114
your body language that, no, it's hiding

852
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,130
something from me. Right. It's something

853
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,180
there that doesn't feel right.

854
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,338
Actually. There's an interesting

855
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:23,974
phenomena, for example, in chronic

856
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:27,514
conditions, which is the concept

857
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:30,490
of cognitive immunization,

858
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,400
where it's very common these days for

859
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,642
patient goes and sees a practitioner,

860
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:39,902
has read, has consulted with Dr. Google

861
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:43,026
to start. Dr. Google said it could be x,

862
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:45,522
Y, and Z, typically the worst case

863
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:49,262
scenario. Goes and sees doctor

864
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,490
number one. Doctor number one says,

865
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,498
yeah, you know what? Nothing to worry

866
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,654
about. There's nothing wrong with you.

867
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:57,814
Patient has got pain, kind of saying,

868
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:00,006
all right, I don't trust you kind of

869
00:43:00,028 --> 00:43:02,434
thing, then goes and sees practitioner

870
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:03,910
number two. That comes with a different

871
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,046
story and yeah, okay, maybe you forget

872
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:08,714
about if forgotten about something goes

873
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,002
to practitioner number three and so on

874
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,862
and gets through a process where authors

875
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:17,646
argue that the

876
00:43:17,668 --> 00:43:20,782
system becomes cognitively immune to any

877
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:24,046
new explanations because the

878
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,302
expectation is surely there's something

879
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,094
wrong with me. So clearly in those

880
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:30,762
conditions, if we take from this lens,

881
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:33,406
one could argue, yeah, as a patient,

882
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:35,886
I'm observing you, I'm kind of reading

883
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,286
your internal states, which is I don't

884
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,286
trust you kind of thing because you're

885
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,910
telling me something, but actually

886
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,666
something that potentially you don't

887
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:47,286
believe either, okay. Or this thing

888
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,090
about, let's do cognitive reassurance

889
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,246
because most nonspecific back pain or

890
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:55,350
neck pain, one cannot say that's clearly

891
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,634
a particular tissue responsible for the

892
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,826
pain, the symptoms and so on. So you

893
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:03,466
say, okay, there's nothing serious with

894
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:05,386
you, so what's wrong with me? You

895
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,238
clearly can't tell the patient you've

896
00:44:07,254 --> 00:44:09,318
got nonspecific back pain because for

897
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:11,038
the patient that means you haven't got a

898
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,214
clue about what's wrong with me. Or

899
00:44:13,252 --> 00:44:14,906
you're implying that something upstairs

900
00:44:14,938 --> 00:44:17,278
in my head, I'm making it up. So

901
00:44:17,444 --> 00:44:20,126
patients observe us for sure, and they

902
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:23,074
know when we kind of are confident and

903
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:26,382
so on, and when we're not so confident.

904
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:27,986
And maybe we're not entirely sure if

905
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:29,490
actually the whole thing is going to

906
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,666
happen. In the same way we observe

907
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:35,202
patients, we start observing

908
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,730
them when they come through the door,

909
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,814
when you first greet them and so on,

910
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:41,874
hi, how are you doing? Before COVID

911
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:44,634
times, shaking hands and so on were a

912
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:47,162
pretty good first kind of getting into

913
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:49,642
someone else's internal state because

914
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:53,354
just the handshake, the quality of

915
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:55,126
the amount of pressure, the confidence

916
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:57,934
and so on. There were cases say this

917
00:44:57,972 --> 00:45:00,494
person is anxious, this person is down,

918
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,414
is depressed, and so on. And you could

919
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:06,622
get that down to when you

920
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:08,914
do clinical examination, you touch, you

921
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:11,986
observe, you feel, you palpate and so

922
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:15,486
on. That implies

923
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,742
that there is a lot of unconscious

924
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:22,440
stuff. That process

925
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,462
comes through, arrives through our

926
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:29,014
sensory, our sensorian and we

927
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:32,358
make something out of it. So I think

928
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:35,306
that's what we kind of one of the things

929
00:45:35,328 --> 00:45:38,202
we try to explore through this stuff

930
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:41,862
about try to understand someone else's

931
00:45:41,926 --> 00:45:45,146
internal state, predicting a little bit

932
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:46,640
of their mental state.

933
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,106
And that's where synchrony and that's

934
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:53,374
where alignment kind of plays that

935
00:45:53,412 --> 00:45:55,486
important role because if there's no

936
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:57,674
alignment, I can't clearly guess what's

937
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,380
wrong going on. The stuff about

938
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,714
Ian, what you mentioned about sense

939
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:06,914
making and so on, sense making is

940
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:08,482
quite an interesting thing. You said,

941
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:13,126
okay, we're not like a

942
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,246
patient is a patient and the

943
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:16,534
practitioner is a practitioner. There is

944
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:19,830
that power differential as well.

945
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,910
There's the doctor, there's the patient.

946
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,130
When one is an expert and when the other

947
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,866
is an expert and things alternate the

948
00:46:31,888 --> 00:46:33,546
whole thing about sense making and

949
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:35,638
actually minimization of free energy and

950
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:37,486
so on. Sense making is quite an

951
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,774
interesting thing too when we look at

952
00:46:39,812 --> 00:46:42,074
some clinical conditions and there's

953
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:44,766
some beautiful stuff written about, for

954
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:48,086
example, mental health and inactive

955
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,298
approaches and looking at, for example

956
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:53,570
depression as a disorder of sense

957
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,730
making, for example. And you see

958
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,126
that sometimes with patients with

959
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,894
chronic musculoskeletal problems that

960
00:47:03,932 --> 00:47:07,154
also have a comorbidity

961
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,814
they have depression. What came first?

962
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:12,182
The depression of the back or the back

963
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:16,454
pain? One could argue that if

964
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:19,066
I suffer from chronic back pain and I

965
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:21,354
can't get out of the house I can't see

966
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:24,246
my friends, I can't walk my dog, I can't

967
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:27,086
play with my children and so on the

968
00:47:27,108 --> 00:47:28,830
world stops kind of making sense,

969
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,478
right? I don't go out because outside

970
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,734
is a cruel world and it's kind of full

971
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:38,658
of dangers and so on. So I stay in a

972
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:41,010
safe environment which is my home

973
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,574
watching telly, kind of complaining

974
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:49,266
about myself to myself and

975
00:47:49,288 --> 00:47:51,154
I become depressed because I'm stuck

976
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:57,174
there. So the

977
00:47:57,212 --> 00:48:00,102
therapeutic encounter that sort of nice

978
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:02,674
ecological niche in a sense creates

979
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:05,194
opportunity for sense making to

980
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:06,906
understand where there's patterns for

981
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:10,058
example, rigid behavior, rigid thinking

982
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:13,830
that actually by understanding,

983
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,742
by interacting can potentially start

984
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:19,326
sort of taking the patient in a

985
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:23,502
particular direction which is this

986
00:48:23,556 --> 00:48:25,950
kind of road to recovery.

987
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:30,226
And one could argue that if someone

988
00:48:30,328 --> 00:48:34,786
starts feeling kind

989
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:38,206
of better in themselves symptoms reduce

990
00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:39,746
a little bit, can start doing a little

991
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:42,406
bit more, can start again engaging with

992
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:45,350
the world. Maybe the other stuff about

993
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,486
feeling miserable would get better as

994
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,566
well. And I think that's sometimes what

995
00:48:50,588 --> 00:48:52,374
we see in musculoskeletal care is this

996
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,810
stuff. We don't treat mental health

997
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,394
conditions and I don't think we should

998
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:57,846
make those claims because they're

999
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:01,062
clearly boundaries

1000
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:04,826
and competences and so on. But the

1001
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:07,406
patient that has got, for example, a

1002
00:49:07,428 --> 00:49:09,550
chronic musculoskeletal problem and gets

1003
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,070
better and gets an impact that impact

1004
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,982
changes their quality of life changes

1005
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,314
their ability to become an agent again

1006
00:49:19,432 --> 00:49:22,318
because pain they lost their agency

1007
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:25,714
because of pain. I think that's where

1008
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:27,714
the beauty of this understanding this

1009
00:49:27,752 --> 00:49:31,986
stuff kind of comes is you can impact

1010
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,854
on different levels of the person of the

1011
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,990
self that is clearly not just that

1012
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,154
embodied self, that body but it's beyond

1013
00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:43,754
that embodied self. Is this

1014
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:46,906
multidimensional kind of what is to

1015
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:48,860
be a person kind of thing, right?

1016
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,634
I think at times it's about kind of

1017
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:58,686
reading the other understanding the

1018
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,454
other guy's internal state is about sort

1019
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:03,774
of doing the right thing at the right

1020
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:07,150
time. Because I know there's a cue that

1021
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,774
tells me maybe if I do this stuff this

1022
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:12,602
could be really one way of getting

1023
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,622
surprising the system in a very positive

1024
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:17,154
way. Okay, so I've just been

1025
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:23,154
pontificating. Zoe yes.

1026
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:26,822
Yeah. I think oh, gosh. Let me take

1027
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,222
my hand down. Okay. Yeah. I think

1028
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,262
similar to what George said on sort of

1029
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:34,674
it's a bird song. I think there's

1030
00:50:34,722 --> 00:50:38,518
different aspects know? Yes. Generally

1031
00:50:38,614 --> 00:50:40,986
on the technical, the physiology or the

1032
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:43,514
anatomy side, then the practitioner is

1033
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:46,586
always obviously more the expert. But I

1034
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,062
think there's certain things where maybe

1035
00:50:48,116 --> 00:50:50,778
you're looking at a patient or you're

1036
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:55,486
still trying to examine them and the

1037
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:56,986
patient is still going to be the expert

1038
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:59,554
in their pain. And so you might be

1039
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:01,842
tossing and turning between a few

1040
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,862
diagnosis, say, and then the patient

1041
00:51:04,926 --> 00:51:07,538
suddenly comes up with like, oh yeah,

1042
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:10,706
by the way, and then what you were

1043
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:12,354
thinking completely goes out. So I think

1044
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:14,886
you completely read them. There's always

1045
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,278
going to be sort of hidden states that

1046
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:19,138
you don't know about and then you're

1047
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:20,486
always on the lookout in case the

1048
00:51:20,508 --> 00:51:23,686
situation is changing or maybe they

1049
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,250
don't want to tell you exactly what it

1050
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,334
is and you think something's missing.

1051
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:29,994
That intuition that maybe there's an

1052
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:32,474
element of this that you're not getting,

1053
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:34,038
or suddenly they got worse and you're

1054
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:36,302
wondering, well, what happened? What

1055
00:51:36,356 --> 00:51:39,726
changed? What goes on? And then you

1056
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:40,960
find out that.

1057
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,358
Their. Child'S been really sick or

1058
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:47,994
something, or their work has been really

1059
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:49,154
stressful or something else has

1060
00:51:49,192 --> 00:51:52,094
happened, excluding that they haven't

1061
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,586
said that you kind of pick up on. So I

1062
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:58,174
think there's that where you're

1063
00:51:58,222 --> 00:52:01,430
inferring what that other person means.

1064
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,182
And there's definitely you're watching

1065
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:06,786
them, they're watching you, and you're

1066
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:09,286
kind of still deciding what's going to

1067
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,606
happen based on what you think is going

1068
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,190
on throughout treatment.

1069
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,022
There's no set treatment for certain

1070
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:21,606
things as well, whether it's exercises

1071
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:25,286
or touch, you have to adapt

1072
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,062
based on what you're feeling and

1073
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:32,154
similarly to what you ian

1074
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:35,486
that brought it up before, the sort

1075
00:52:35,508 --> 00:52:37,326
of synchrony and whether it's exact or

1076
00:52:37,348 --> 00:52:39,858
not. Well, it sort of also depends on

1077
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:42,082
the stimulus. There's a lot of research

1078
00:52:42,216 --> 00:52:45,730
that there was one paper that

1079
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,730
was about a film and they got

1080
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,390
two separate people to watch the same

1081
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,054
film by themselves

1082
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:59,394
at separate times, but in certain parts

1083
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,782
of the film, their heart rate was

1084
00:53:01,836 --> 00:53:05,254
exactly the same. Their heart rate went

1085
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:08,346
up when the fight scene happened and

1086
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:10,186
then their heart rate went down the

1087
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,946
same. And actually, you know, the

1088
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:13,914
difference was they were in sync even

1089
00:53:13,952 --> 00:53:16,906
though they were nowhere near each

1090
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,378
other, couldn't see each other, didn't

1091
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:19,486
know what that person was doing.

1092
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:20,462
They're probably doing completely

1093
00:53:20,516 --> 00:53:22,330
different things, but the stimulus

1094
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,518
dictated the synchrony. So I think

1095
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:29,818
that's an interesting thing to

1096
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:31,774
consider as well, that the synchrony

1097
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:34,414
might be from the stimulus that's

1098
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:35,746
happening during the treatment, whether

1099
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:37,282
it's touch, whether it's something else,

1100
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:40,820
but we focused on touch. But yeah,

1101
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,366
whether you synchronize just based on

1102
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,720
what you're in that moment,

1103
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,254
but actually it's completely different

1104
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,470
otherwise. Yeah,

1105
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,740
just wanted to point that out. Thanks.

1106
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,954
That reminds me a lot of this direct

1107
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:03,446
interfacing mechanism of synchrony,

1108
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:05,794
which might be via, like auditory

1109
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,846
communication, touch and so on. And then

1110
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:12,746
there's this more stigma, g based niche

1111
00:54:12,778 --> 00:54:16,094
modification construction of a

1112
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:18,842
niche, like a corn maze where everybody

1113
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,766
walking through it is having a shared

1114
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:22,466
experience. Or like you said, with two

1115
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:24,818
people watching the same film. It's like

1116
00:54:24,904 --> 00:54:28,062
there's some similarity in their niche.

1117
00:54:28,206 --> 00:54:31,474
And so there's a resulting

1118
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,246
synchronization without direct

1119
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:37,522
interfacing because they're interacting

1120
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:40,178
in a shared there's something shared

1121
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,622
about their niche. Either two people

1122
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:43,514
going through the same niche at

1123
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,090
different moments, patients coming

1124
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,994
through a space, or there's people that

1125
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:53,466
are in separate physical spaces, but the

1126
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:56,826
niche has some similarity. And I'm sure

1127
00:54:56,848 --> 00:54:58,494
there's a lot of other examples like

1128
00:54:58,532 --> 00:55:01,946
that. Ian. And then I have that image

1129
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,582
up if you want to describe what you

1130
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:06,810
wanted to share there. Thanks, Daniel.

1131
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,594
Yeah, I will describe that in a moment.

1132
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:12,286
But as conversation about films,

1133
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:14,306
I'm just thinking that Hollywood and

1134
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:16,740
filmmakers are actually masters of

1135
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,938
inducing synchrony. Really. They've got

1136
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:22,006
the birdsong, so they've got the

1137
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,294
beautiful music or the dramatic music or

1138
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:27,334
whatever. Got the imagery, the words,

1139
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,198
the composition of the images to

1140
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:32,102
hopefully not obviously not everyone

1141
00:55:32,156 --> 00:55:33,710
will have the same experience of a film.

1142
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,940
But they hope that their sad film will

1143
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,818
induce some synchrony amongst the

1144
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:42,826
viewers in terms of the response in

1145
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:45,126
their body. Or a happy film will induce

1146
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:51,198
some kind of rhythmic and

1147
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:55,054
I'm thinking about some work I've heard.

1148
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:57,374
Of recently of John Viveki looking at

1149
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:02,130
emotional goosebumps and how

1150
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,050
this links to he thinks

1151
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,282
the process of temperature regulation is

1152
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:12,920
being exacted up into some kind of

1153
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,214
relevant or bringing things salient to

1154
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:18,710
us through goosebumps.

1155
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,646
And there's an opportunity there to kind

1156
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:25,094
of open up cognitively and explore some

1157
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,086
other ideas that maybe the person wasn't

1158
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,514
able to before. And you can think,

1159
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,966
okay, that music gave me goosebumps,

1160
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:33,718
and I had all these so, yeah, there's

1161
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,802
just a few things as we were talking

1162
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:37,374
there that I was thinking about. But

1163
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,486
this diagram was, George, as you were

1164
00:56:39,508 --> 00:56:42,622
talking about, the kind of how the

1165
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:46,240
complex things that might be at play

1166
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:50,394
within a patient. This was done by MIT,

1167
00:56:50,522 --> 00:56:52,194
only found out about it a few days ago.

1168
00:56:52,232 --> 00:56:55,122
It was 2015. But all of these different

1169
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:57,266
factors that might lead someone into a

1170
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:01,074
kind of vicious cycle of depression.

1171
00:57:01,122 --> 00:57:07,122
And we've got things like cortisol

1172
00:57:07,186 --> 00:57:10,774
or unbridled inflammation at the top

1173
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:12,166
there. But then you've also got, as you

1174
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:14,166
said, George, the physical inactivity

1175
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,946
and how this you've got all these

1176
00:57:15,968 --> 00:57:18,454
different looping perception action

1177
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:21,626
cycles here that are creating this sort

1178
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:24,662
of downward spiral. And therapeutically,

1179
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:25,914
I guess what we're trying to do is

1180
00:57:25,952 --> 00:57:28,666
create an upward opening, trying to get

1181
00:57:28,688 --> 00:57:31,118
an access point. And Zoe, you said you

1182
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:33,470
might have to try lots of looking,

1183
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,166
trying one of these loops. And if that

1184
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:38,358
doesn't work, okay, try a different loop

1185
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:41,006
to open up this sort of thing that's

1186
00:57:41,038 --> 00:57:43,842
tightening and maybe open it up either

1187
00:57:43,896 --> 00:57:47,090
physically or perceptually.

1188
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,494
Yeah. Thank you. This is like very much

1189
00:57:51,532 --> 00:57:54,902
showing that complex causation. And so

1190
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:57,862
sometimes a disciplinary approach might

1191
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,454
be like well, hippocampal volume is

1192
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:02,854
associated with this change and that

1193
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:05,386
could absolutely be empirically true or

1194
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:07,926
cytokine signaling or early adverse

1195
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,666
experiences. And so part of the

1196
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:13,990
challenge is reassembling this complex

1197
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,934
causal network. And then even if there

1198
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:20,254
were some sort of causal network that

1199
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,998
could be reassembled, then how

1200
00:58:24,164 --> 00:58:28,238
might the failure mode be similar

1201
00:58:28,324 --> 00:58:31,070
or different from the recovery mode?

1202
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,514
Like there are certain things that

1203
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:36,194
cannot be changed, like in the past and

1204
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:38,386
there's other things kind of like the

1205
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:41,966
concept of hysteresis where we can't

1206
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:45,522
just reversibly modify something.

1207
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:48,034
And so where are the leverage points in

1208
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:51,454
this diagram? And it's

1209
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:54,220
yeah, George, it.

1210
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,724
Yeah, it's pretty complex, but yeah,

1211
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:04,070
very good diagram for sure. And I think

1212
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,704
there's a lot of stuff that we are

1213
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:11,368
talking about that's clearly there I

1214
00:59:11,374 --> 00:59:15,624
think clearly we

1215
00:59:15,662 --> 00:59:18,292
have modifiable and non modifiable

1216
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:22,350
things. There's stuff we can't change

1217
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,852
someone else's genetics, we can't change

1218
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:28,396
what happened in the past, okay? But

1219
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:32,290
they are modifiable things that at least

1220
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:36,050
in the context of musculoskeletal care

1221
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,308
are present that can include beliefs,

1222
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:43,408
their priors about their ideas about

1223
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:45,892
pain, what's wrong with them and so on

1224
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:49,540
down to things that could be lifestyle

1225
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,340
and lifestyle could be more movement,

1226
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,220
kind of changing the diet or whatever.

1227
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,384
Stop smoking, kind of engaging in

1228
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:02,104
something that starts getting them kind

1229
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:05,560
of start getting their sense making

1230
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,316
back. Okay. Through the

1231
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:15,068
sense, the ideas. And actually the

1232
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:16,716
other interesting thing about this stuff

1233
01:00:16,818 --> 01:00:18,300
where are the opportunities?

1234
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,610
How can we start that process of change?

1235
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,396
A very nice model, typically aligned

1236
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,024
more with an activist approach now sort

1237
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,760
of finding ways into pain and so on,

1238
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,984
are the ecological psychology ideas

1239
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,180
about affordances.

1240
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,580
What is out there in the environment?

1241
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,636
Already linked some authors to kind of

1242
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:47,524
the active inference, predictive

1243
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:50,424
processing and so on. But clearly one

1244
01:00:50,462 --> 01:00:54,116
can think about the world provides

1245
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:57,764
us with a landscape of affordances

1246
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:01,944
stuff that kind of are

1247
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:03,484
opportunities for action, which is

1248
01:01:03,522 --> 01:01:04,956
basically what the description of an

1249
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:07,228
affordance is and one that lives in a

1250
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:08,892
very nice environment, for example,

1251
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:12,032
with a beautiful park and can walk along

1252
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,324
the coastline and stress

1253
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,952
free environment and so on. Clearly that

1254
01:01:18,006 --> 01:01:21,168
world, it's a world for the sort of

1255
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:23,344
beautiful kind of lifestyle and so on,

1256
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:26,096
right? Whereas if one lives in an urban

1257
01:01:26,128 --> 01:01:28,736
jungle and everybody's super stressed

1258
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,404
outside and so on, arguably that

1259
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:33,696
landscape kind of is much smaller.

1260
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:36,836
And when we say, yeah, would be good for

1261
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:39,236
you to start walking, for example, that

1262
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:41,236
would be a good way of start managing

1263
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:43,384
your back pain. The patient can say,

1264
01:01:43,422 --> 01:01:45,496
yeah, but when I get out of the house,

1265
01:01:45,598 --> 01:01:48,344
I'm struggling. I might just get run

1266
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:50,684
over by a car straight away. The

1267
01:01:50,722 --> 01:01:52,968
environment outside is awful. There's

1268
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:55,116
pollution everywhere. What do you want

1269
01:01:55,138 --> 01:01:56,030
me to do?

1270
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,764
I'm scared of going outside. So, no,

1271
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:02,716
thank you very much. But of course, if

1272
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:05,504
you are on the other side of the

1273
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,224
spectrum, you can invite the person and

1274
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:11,088
use what's out there and start playing a

1275
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,784
little bit with those opportunities for

1276
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:16,964
action. I think those

1277
01:02:17,002 --> 01:02:20,516
are tools that if we think sometimes we

1278
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:22,324
can start thinking very hard about what

1279
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:24,692
sort of exercises should the patient do,

1280
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:27,268
should the person get engaged and so on.

1281
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:30,596
And if we think much in much simpler

1282
01:02:30,628 --> 01:02:33,032
terms and think about what's outside,

1283
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,184
what's out there, what kind of things

1284
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:37,896
are already in the environment that can

1285
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:41,450
be used to actually promote change,

1286
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,564
we would be surprised that actually just

1287
01:02:43,602 --> 01:02:45,388
a flight of stairs would be good enough.

1288
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,950
Don't take the lift. Take the stairs and

1289
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,852
start sort of walking a little bit back

1290
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:54,320
and forth from home to work and so on.

1291
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,032
Those minimal things, if the person

1292
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:58,304
feels like, yeah, okay, I'll have a go,

1293
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:01,856
and I'll try that. Clearly we are in

1294
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:05,956
that process of kind

1295
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:08,484
of changing a little bit of their sort

1296
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:11,664
of internal state. Maybe that prior

1297
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:14,784
about, yeah, I can't move, I can't lift,

1298
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,112
because it will damage my back. In fact,

1299
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,960
when they start trusting their bodies,

1300
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,410
they can do a little bit more.

1301
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,840
It's always hard to think about, okay,

1302
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,676
how can I change this? How can I change

1303
01:03:29,778 --> 01:03:31,692
the generative model? And we almost

1304
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:34,552
think everything needs to be conscious,

1305
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:37,756
cognitive and so on, when in fact, a lot

1306
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:40,030
of stuff happens unconsciously. Right?

1307
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,576
If it was always about, I'm going to

1308
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:46,384
think about changing and I'm going to do

1309
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,424
this, then the world would be much

1310
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:52,784
simpler. Right. But a lot of stuff is

1311
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,996
hidden anyway, and even the person is

1312
01:03:55,018 --> 01:03:56,470
not aware of that stuff.

1313
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,896
So the change, the process, the tools

1314
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:04,484
and so on, that goes

1315
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:07,664
back to that very good diagram

1316
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:10,056
with all these factors. And I think as a

1317
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:12,728
practitioner, yes, okay. I can focus

1318
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:14,776
entirely on the brain and the

1319
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:17,208
neuroscience of it and become like a

1320
01:04:17,214 --> 01:04:19,832
brain centric approach, or I can start

1321
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:22,532
thinking about actually the brain is

1322
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:25,660
it's the hardware kind of stuff, but

1323
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,076
there's much more in it and much more in

1324
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,076
it. Takes the person, takes the

1325
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:31,436
environment, takes the kind of

1326
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,424
opportunities and so on. The stuff out

1327
01:04:33,462 --> 01:04:35,010
there can be used.

1328
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,000
Thank you, George. Zoe?

1329
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,824
Yeah. Just going off of what George said

1330
01:04:43,862 --> 01:04:46,516
in terms of the environment around it,

1331
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:50,368
like when you're sort of maybe if you're

1332
01:04:50,464 --> 01:04:52,436
surrounded by nature or things like

1333
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:54,324
that, then you might be sort of more

1334
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:57,012
willing or more able to change your

1335
01:04:57,066 --> 01:04:59,496
priors. I think it's also important to

1336
01:04:59,518 --> 01:05:01,144
realize, especially through touch, that

1337
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:04,792
it's one modality. Right. It's one way

1338
01:05:04,926 --> 01:05:07,320
in which we're starting to kind of try

1339
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:11,064
to understand and try to manipulate

1340
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:13,164
the process of sort of changing those

1341
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:15,912
memories, whether it's the way it's

1342
01:05:16,056 --> 01:05:19,356
processed or just having initially or

1343
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,984
just trying to adapt it. And that's that

1344
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:25,760
touch is one way. But I think also

1345
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:29,664
it's interesting that it's probably more

1346
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:32,336
likely that we may not be able to

1347
01:05:32,518 --> 01:05:36,492
completely change that sort of prior,

1348
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:39,524
but we might in that context. So we

1349
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:41,456
might not change the fact that it's

1350
01:05:41,488 --> 01:05:43,444
painful to bend down, but we might be

1351
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:46,036
able to, through touch and through sort

1352
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:49,144
of treatment, get the patient to

1353
01:05:49,182 --> 01:05:51,876
realize, okay, well, yes, maybe bending

1354
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:54,552
forwards is dangerous. It is a bad

1355
01:05:54,606 --> 01:05:58,600
thing. But if you do it in a certain way

1356
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,524
and you look at it in this way, then

1357
01:06:00,562 --> 01:06:03,916
actually it's not so bad. So I

1358
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:07,196
think it's important to take

1359
01:06:07,218 --> 01:06:10,044
the context into it. I think with this,

1360
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:12,144
I think we might be able to maybe not

1361
01:06:12,182 --> 01:06:15,324
completely change the maladaptive

1362
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:18,000
belief, but with touch we can try to

1363
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,764
change it so that it's more context

1364
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:23,084
specific rather than a general belief

1365
01:06:23,132 --> 01:06:24,928
that isn't able to change. We might be

1366
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:26,692
able to change it. So in certain

1367
01:06:26,746 --> 01:06:29,604
circumstances, whether it's the way we

1368
01:06:29,642 --> 01:06:31,204
do things or just the way that we

1369
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:33,990
approach things, we might be able to

1370
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,044
update it or modify it for that specific

1371
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:40,816
thing. I know that papers

1372
01:06:40,848 --> 01:06:42,336
were talking about it in terms of like

1373
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:44,936
being scared of spiders. You might still

1374
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,456
be scared of spiders, but if you know

1375
01:06:46,478 --> 01:06:47,656
that you're scared of spiders and

1376
01:06:47,678 --> 01:06:50,804
they've got food nearby and the spider

1377
01:06:50,852 --> 01:06:52,884
is happy, then maybe, yeah, the spider

1378
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:54,716
is still scary, but it's not likely to

1379
01:06:54,738 --> 01:06:57,404
kill you or something like that. In this

1380
01:06:57,442 --> 01:06:59,356
circumstance, it's not as bad as it

1381
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,180
could be and you're going to be safe

1382
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,616
from whatever sort of fear it is. So I

1383
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:06,816
think that's an important thing to

1384
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:08,528
add on from what George was saying, and

1385
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:10,992
I'll pass it back to George. Yes,

1386
01:07:11,046 --> 01:07:12,210
George. And then.

1387
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,550
Know what Zoe just said.

1388
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,780
It's quite important. And through touch

1389
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:27,272
we can clearly get in kind of

1390
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:31,144
affect, understand and so on. I think

1391
01:07:31,182 --> 01:07:34,072
that's all the positive stuff about

1392
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:36,888
touch. There's another factor, another

1393
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:39,484
side of the equation which I think as

1394
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,820
practitioners we need to be aware of,

1395
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:45,384
which is the power of what's the hidden

1396
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:48,060
state and that touch can trigger.

1397
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,532
And particularly in trauma situations,

1398
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:54,976
memories are embodied. And when you

1399
01:07:54,998 --> 01:07:57,408
touch someone in a particular part of

1400
01:07:57,414 --> 01:08:00,192
the body, that might again bring that

1401
01:08:00,246 --> 01:08:03,488
unconscious stuff about. For example,

1402
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:06,944
someone has been victim of sexual abuse

1403
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:10,020
for example and you could touch a person

1404
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,964
and straight away either there is a sort

1405
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:16,908
of a massive response

1406
01:08:17,104 --> 01:08:19,704
fight or flight what's going on here?

1407
01:08:19,902 --> 01:08:23,416
Or if it is about this sort of

1408
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:26,232
hidden state you might actually find

1409
01:08:26,286 --> 01:08:28,936
that that touch kind of created a

1410
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:31,924
response that is almost like a no go

1411
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,736
zone. And you kind of need to be aware

1412
01:08:33,768 --> 01:08:36,044
that sometimes you touch people that

1413
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:38,444
don't like being touched. Someone goes

1414
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:41,176
to a clinician that in an intervention

1415
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:44,284
is primarily touch based, doesn't like

1416
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:47,408
being touched, it might go well, it

1417
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,984
might synchronize extremely well. They

1418
01:08:50,022 --> 01:08:51,328
understand you, they talk when you

1419
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:52,496
start, say, okay, let's have a look.

1420
01:08:52,518 --> 01:08:54,870
Let's palpate that you can feel like

1421
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,776
there's a fight or flight kind of mode.

1422
01:08:57,808 --> 01:09:00,196
The person goes in straight away. So I

1423
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:04,084
think understanding this is

1424
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:06,016
also quite important in understanding

1425
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:09,576
the limits of competence of someone in

1426
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:12,168
Musculoskeletal care, for example, that

1427
01:09:12,254 --> 01:09:13,896
that's an area that where probably the

1428
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:15,512
person needs to be referred to someone

1429
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:19,320
else, an expert in the area. Maybe by

1430
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,184
getting a sense of there's a response

1431
01:09:22,232 --> 01:09:24,430
here. That's not the one I would expect

1432
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,216
to perhaps not then to open the Pandora

1433
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:31,292
box. Oh, tell me a little bit about

1434
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:33,490
what's going on here because again,

1435
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:40,832
you pressed on a button that keep

1436
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,024
the lid on kind of thing. Don't open it,

1437
01:09:43,062 --> 01:09:45,940
please. This is important,

1438
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:49,684
I think, both ways. It's kind of the

1439
01:09:49,722 --> 01:09:52,532
power as a therapeutic tool, but also

1440
01:09:52,586 --> 01:09:56,164
the power of triggering responses that

1441
01:09:56,202 --> 01:10:00,136
actually are quite important to

1442
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:03,736
take into account. And in fact, the

1443
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:05,416
paper we got accepted yesterday, which

1444
01:10:05,438 --> 01:10:06,568
is the continuation of this in

1445
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:08,936
musculoskeletal care, one of the

1446
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:11,390
reviewers actually wanted us to say

1447
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,220
there are psychologists,

1448
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,150
psychotherapy treat people, that

1449
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,028
memories are embodied and you need to be

1450
01:10:20,114 --> 01:10:23,424
aware of avoiding overlaps. Okay? So

1451
01:10:23,462 --> 01:10:25,616
that means don't jump into an area that

1452
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,544
you don't know about, but be aware that

1453
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:31,708
sometimes you're getting that response

1454
01:10:31,804 --> 01:10:33,536
pretty much you're getting into someone

1455
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:36,916
hidden state stuff that is there in the

1456
01:10:36,938 --> 01:10:39,232
background. Just leave it alone,

1457
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:41,924
please. That's the way at least I see

1458
01:10:42,122 --> 01:10:46,716
the world around me is like don't

1459
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:48,644
sort of start the process that you don't

1460
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:51,304
want to or if you don't, if you do,

1461
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:53,290
then go and see someone.

1462
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,920
Or sorry, Ian. And then blue.

1463
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,904
Oh, it's okay. I didn't have my hand up.

1464
01:11:04,942 --> 01:11:07,790
So over to blue. OK, blue, go for it.

1465
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,460
So it's interesting, and I don't know if

1466
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:15,856
in your work as an osteopath, but

1467
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,784
there's many layers I found through

1468
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,296
working emotionally, physically on

1469
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,104
myself through my life. It's like

1470
01:11:23,142 --> 01:11:25,264
peeling an onion, right? And so as you

1471
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:29,856
go through, it's interesting that all

1472
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:33,104
this stuff resurfaces and even physical

1473
01:11:33,152 --> 01:11:35,236
trauma remains there. Like you stub your

1474
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:37,204
pinky toe. You stub your pinky toe 25

1475
01:11:37,242 --> 01:11:39,968
times, 35 times, 255 times, who knows

1476
01:11:39,984 --> 01:11:41,168
how many times, right? It depends on how

1477
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:43,396
clumsy you are. But your pinky toe

1478
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:45,944
remembers being stubbed. It has maybe

1479
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:47,736
like a hyper response because it's been

1480
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:49,252
stubbed so many times, because it's

1481
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:51,964
whatever that's its little job in life

1482
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:56,504
is to be stubbed, I think. But it's

1483
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:59,836
interesting that you kind of have to

1484
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,716
open it up to do the work.

1485
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,452
And I wonder what kind of synchronous

1486
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:08,096
work there is. I know that there are

1487
01:12:08,118 --> 01:12:10,832
some people that deal with physical and

1488
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:13,372
emotional trauma and I know physical

1489
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:15,056
trauma can be a manifestation of

1490
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:17,184
emotional trauma and you can have

1491
01:12:17,222 --> 01:12:18,704
emotional trauma based on your physical

1492
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,804
trauma. So again, it's like this bi

1493
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:24,084
directional circular loop and I

1494
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:25,636
wonder what the training is in

1495
01:12:25,658 --> 01:12:28,368
osteopathy to deal with emotional trauma

1496
01:12:28,384 --> 01:12:32,310
that may come up or what kind of

1497
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,964
are there people that do integrative

1498
01:12:35,012 --> 01:12:37,816
practices? Like you have to be an

1499
01:12:37,838 --> 01:12:39,256
osteopath and then maybe you do your

1500
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:41,320
residency as a psychiatrist?

1501
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,916
Can you get it all out if you have some

1502
01:12:45,938 --> 01:12:48,204
kind of linked problem that's both

1503
01:12:48,242 --> 01:12:49,820
physical and emotional?

1504
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,220
Thank you, George. Then Ian.

1505
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,130
Okay,

1506
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,756
so the model in terms of therapeutic

1507
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:03,632
alliance and synchrony and using touch

1508
01:13:03,686 --> 01:13:05,744
if we use to the whole world of

1509
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:10,596
healthcare practice could argue that in

1510
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:12,708
a world of psychotherapy for example

1511
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:16,260
mind body kind of stuff the person

1512
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:20,804
would be sort of equipped

1513
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:23,284
with the tools to explore, to enable

1514
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,008
them to open up, to start the process.

1515
01:13:26,174 --> 01:13:29,096
And being able to deal with that the

1516
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:32,024
paper as a kind of a generic kind of

1517
01:13:32,062 --> 01:13:35,420
model that could apply as an umbrella to

1518
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:38,412
a number of areas of practice. For sure,

1519
01:13:38,466 --> 01:13:40,716
we can do that and no problem. If we

1520
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:42,568
think specifically about manual therapy

1521
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,784
and specifically about osteopathy, then

1522
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:47,248
you've got two worlds, the American

1523
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:49,744
world of osteopathic medicine, where

1524
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:52,450
osteopathic medicine is medicine. And

1525
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,596
there are osteopaths in the US who are

1526
01:13:58,618 --> 01:14:01,092
psychiatrists as well. And in that case,

1527
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:04,928
yes, that person would be ideally suited

1528
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:08,672
to be able to explore that, to do that,

1529
01:14:08,746 --> 01:14:11,240
to kind of start that process of care,

1530
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:14,136
actually using both their competences as

1531
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,370
a psychiatrist and their competences as

1532
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,548
also manual therapist as a hands on kind

1533
01:14:21,554 --> 01:14:24,860
of a practitioner. In other countries,

1534
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,824
osteopaths are primarily kind of manual

1535
01:14:32,872 --> 01:14:34,328
therapists, if you want to call it that

1536
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:35,824
way. Although osteopaths don't like

1537
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:37,216
being called manual therapists, but

1538
01:14:37,238 --> 01:14:40,060
primarily use manual therapy primarily

1539
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,716
in musculoskeletal care, but other areas

1540
01:14:42,748 --> 01:14:45,088
of practice. And we start seeing a

1541
01:14:45,094 --> 01:14:47,044
number of practitioners going down the

1542
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,804
route of like physiotherapists using

1543
01:14:51,002 --> 01:14:52,752
what is called a psychologically

1544
01:14:52,816 --> 01:14:55,764
informed type of practice. And that

1545
01:14:55,802 --> 01:14:57,872
typically involves some additional

1546
01:14:57,936 --> 01:15:00,664
training in counseling or some

1547
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:04,120
additional training in some CBT like

1548
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:06,810
kind of approaches. Like, for example,

1549
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,644
something like acceptance and commitment

1550
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:12,844
therapy, for example. So stuff that

1551
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:15,310
actually combined with hands on

1552
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,144
potentiates the effect of the treatment

1553
01:15:21,192 --> 01:15:23,164
that the hands on alone would not

1554
01:15:23,202 --> 01:15:25,632
achieve. But when you come from the two

1555
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:28,048
kind of two different angles meeting in

1556
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:31,180
the middle and providing a more robust

1557
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,592
package of care you can get better

1558
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:38,150
results. Because the training

1559
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,052
as a preregistration level is very

1560
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:45,616
basic to enable

1561
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:48,052
you to recognize that there are things

1562
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:52,052
that need a referral

1563
01:15:52,116 --> 01:15:56,184
to another practitioner even those that

1564
01:15:56,382 --> 01:15:58,776
practice a psychologically informed type

1565
01:15:58,798 --> 01:16:00,596
of practice. Like several

1566
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:03,516
physiotherapists have developed a kind

1567
01:16:03,538 --> 01:16:05,992
of a traffic light system where clearly

1568
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:08,510
there are stuff on the yellow that

1569
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,644
anxiety is associated with pain and so

1570
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:14,044
on. That's okay, you can deal with that.

1571
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:18,176
There's some stuff kind of in

1572
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,936
the orange that you have to be a little

1573
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,472
bit careful. And there are clearly stuff

1574
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:23,330
PTSDs and so on,

1575
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:28,496
where it's a no go zone because you

1576
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:30,196
can dive in. And then you don't know if

1577
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,308
you're going to come back okay kind of

1578
01:16:32,314 --> 01:16:35,104
thing. So that is typically a referral

1579
01:16:35,152 --> 01:16:36,964
to another practitioner. Having said

1580
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:39,060
that, I think there are opportunities

1581
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:42,152
for collaborative work where the two

1582
01:16:42,286 --> 01:16:44,792
together can actually provide a much

1583
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:47,412
better service to a person that's simply

1584
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:50,216
relying on one practitioner that can do

1585
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,472
everything. I think that sometimes

1586
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:54,324
exploring stuff through the physical

1587
01:16:54,372 --> 01:16:57,848
body, the embodied self opens the doors

1588
01:16:58,024 --> 01:17:00,332
for stuff to be explored at other

1589
01:17:00,386 --> 01:17:03,948
elements of the self when the body is a

1590
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:05,872
little bit more prepared to deal with

1591
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:08,064
stuff and people maybe are prepared to

1592
01:17:08,102 --> 01:17:11,490
talk. Sometimes you see that in cases of

1593
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:15,376
childhood abuse and so on. Kind of

1594
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:18,032
had some stuff that felt good, some

1595
01:17:18,086 --> 01:17:20,028
hands on work, even the massage and the

1596
01:17:20,054 --> 01:17:22,036
person felt a bit more confident in

1597
01:17:22,058 --> 01:17:23,972
themselves and they were prepared then

1598
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:26,004
let's have a chat. And they were not

1599
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:28,068
prepared to sort of go to talking

1600
01:17:28,154 --> 01:17:31,864
therapy straight away because there was

1601
01:17:31,902 --> 01:17:34,504
too much going on in there. Kind of

1602
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:38,132
invited itself. The sirens

1603
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:40,730
go off when certain things happen.

1604
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,580
Exactly. Ian.

1605
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,404
Yes. So just sort of picking up on the

1606
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:52,670
points from George and the question from

1607
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,944
yeah really totally agree that it's not

1608
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:01,644
the job of an untrained manual therapist

1609
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:05,456
to kind of aim to open a

1610
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:08,416
can of worms of something that

1611
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:10,112
especially if it's not five minutes

1612
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:11,524
before the end of a session, and then

1613
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,276
you kind of say, okay, I want to see you

1614
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:16,516
later, see you next week, and got

1615
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:18,820
another client now, and that's

1616
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,816
definitely not a good idea. However, as

1617
01:18:21,838 --> 01:18:23,688
you said, George, sometimes people will

1618
01:18:23,774 --> 01:18:25,992
come and they'll want to offer things

1619
01:18:26,046 --> 01:18:28,330
and they'll want to talk about stuff.

1620
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,500
And what I was thinking about Blue as

1621
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:34,636
you were asking about sort of the

1622
01:18:34,738 --> 01:18:36,748
different combinations of approaches. I

1623
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,868
don't know if George and Zoe or any of

1624
01:18:39,874 --> 01:18:42,136
you are familiar with David Bocelli's

1625
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:45,544
work on tre trauma release or tension

1626
01:18:45,592 --> 01:18:46,380
release.

1627
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,344
You know, he doesn't really go into the

1628
01:18:51,382 --> 01:18:53,072
story. So it's not kind of

1629
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:56,468
psychoanalytical or unraveling the

1630
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:58,340
stories of people's past. But he has

1631
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:02,324
methods for inducing kind of what

1632
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,564
I think is myofascial and what it looks

1633
01:19:04,602 --> 01:19:06,692
like myofascial unwinding. So sometimes

1634
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:10,280
it's tremoring and

1635
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,024
so it's sort of I don't think he

1636
01:19:14,142 --> 01:19:16,360
necessarily uses touch in the beginning,

1637
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,896
but I guess what

1638
01:19:19,918 --> 01:19:21,564
I'm thinking is that there are ways that

1639
01:19:21,602 --> 01:19:25,720
if the ways of offering clients

1640
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,772
opportunities to unravel the

1641
01:19:29,906 --> 01:19:33,196
bodily trapped or the stuff

1642
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:35,596
that's held in the body where they don't

1643
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:37,216
have to verbalize it if they don't want

1644
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:41,312
to. But the inroad is to

1645
01:19:41,366 --> 01:19:44,656
induce some kind of letting go, which

1646
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:46,896
maybe is what all manual therapy is

1647
01:19:46,918 --> 01:19:48,656
about, to a greater or lesser degree.

1648
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:51,296
But his examples are quite dramatic.

1649
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:54,772
People will be making big movements that

1650
01:19:54,826 --> 01:19:56,436
seemingly are uncontrolled but if you

1651
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,052
ask them to stop at any time, they can

1652
01:19:58,106 --> 01:20:00,260
stop. They can bring it into voluntary.

1653
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,472
But there seems to be a really big

1654
01:20:02,526 --> 01:20:04,504
updating of some generative model

1655
01:20:04,622 --> 01:20:05,770
through this process.

1656
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,240
Yeah, they're my thoughts.

1657
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,492
Thank you. I'm going to return to our

1658
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:19,240
previous complex causation network.

1659
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,616
Now, it's smaller because we're

1660
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:22,204
abstracting away from the details and

1661
01:20:22,242 --> 01:20:24,376
think about, like, what are some active

1662
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:26,784
inference questions that come to mind

1663
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,904
and how could we look at this

1664
01:20:27,942 --> 01:20:30,336
differently than, for example, just a

1665
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,992
structural equation model that's fit

1666
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:35,616
from many empirical studies? And so

1667
01:20:35,718 --> 01:20:38,592
here's Figure 4.3 from the textbook.

1668
01:20:38,736 --> 01:20:41,280
And this is a partially observable

1669
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,036
Markov decision process. And it's come

1670
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:46,468
up in other papers and live streams, so

1671
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,076
we won't go into too much details. But

1672
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,616
the kinds of things that we might want

1673
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,864
to ask are, like, what variables are

1674
01:20:53,902 --> 01:20:57,416
latent states or observable in general?

1675
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:59,416
And then in the specific case, for

1676
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,450
example, maybe there's a total,

1677
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,044
absolutely perfect association between

1678
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:05,964
hippocampus volume and some other

1679
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:08,504
clinical outcome. And so hippocampus

1680
01:21:08,552 --> 01:21:11,084
volume conceptually is observable. It

1681
01:21:11,122 --> 01:21:14,016
could be observed. But in that exact

1682
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:16,128
patient's case, it may not be an

1683
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:19,376
observable in that relationship. So

1684
01:21:19,558 --> 01:21:22,064
variables can be observable in one

1685
01:21:22,102 --> 01:21:24,396
context and latent in another context.

1686
01:21:24,508 --> 01:21:26,980
So that might speak to evidence based

1687
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,584
grounding where like, okay, we don't

1688
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:32,404
know what somebody's blood level of this

1689
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:34,996
is, what's the most informative thing to

1690
01:21:35,018 --> 01:21:37,924
do? Maybe we can measure it. And then

1691
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:40,968
that ties their measurements into other

1692
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:42,760
observables. So that's one question.

1693
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,996
What are observables and what are latent

1694
01:21:45,028 --> 01:21:48,024
variables? What variables do we have

1695
01:21:48,062 --> 01:21:50,912
causal influence on? What affordances

1696
01:21:50,996 --> 01:21:54,264
exist that might have intervening

1697
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:57,164
influence on some unobserved state? So

1698
01:21:57,202 --> 01:21:59,560
here's, like, pi the policy selection

1699
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,092
and then the way that the hidden state

1700
01:22:02,146 --> 01:22:04,876
is changing through time. That's what

1701
01:22:04,898 --> 01:22:07,548
the affordances are about. Influencing

1702
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:09,404
the hidden state is the true temperature

1703
01:22:09,452 --> 01:22:11,296
of the room. The thermometer is the

1704
01:22:11,318 --> 01:22:14,064
observed value. And then taking an

1705
01:22:14,102 --> 01:22:16,076
action like turning on the air

1706
01:22:16,118 --> 01:22:17,956
conditioning is about intervening in the

1707
01:22:17,978 --> 01:22:21,856
hidden state such that other observables

1708
01:22:21,888 --> 01:22:24,964
are seen. And then we talked also about

1709
01:22:25,002 --> 01:22:28,464
like, in what ways can we change the

1710
01:22:28,522 --> 01:22:30,568
generative model? So here's the policy

1711
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:34,552
selection of the practitioner. And then

1712
01:22:34,606 --> 01:22:36,436
in the interface, it's like, it's

1713
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:40,184
meeting with the observations of

1714
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:43,228
the patient. The actions of the

1715
01:22:43,314 --> 01:22:44,956
practitioner, what they say and what

1716
01:22:44,978 --> 01:22:47,160
they do are received as observations.

1717
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,236
And that's kind of this dyad active that

1718
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,012
we've seen. So rather than the one

1719
01:22:52,066 --> 01:22:54,656
entity navigating and sense making in

1720
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:57,170
the world, the joint sense making

1721
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,616
features, this interface where the

1722
01:22:59,638 --> 01:23:02,304
policy selections on one and their

1723
01:23:02,422 --> 01:23:04,352
thinking through other minds, their

1724
01:23:04,406 --> 01:23:06,356
inference on the generative model of the

1725
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:10,884
other is what is being intervened in.

1726
01:23:11,082 --> 01:23:13,028
How can we change the generative model,

1727
01:23:13,194 --> 01:23:15,764
the cognitive models? How can we change

1728
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:18,036
the generative process? Could there be

1729
01:23:18,058 --> 01:23:21,416
something welcoming on the door of

1730
01:23:21,438 --> 01:23:24,136
the room that is a modification of the

1731
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,480
niche or some other design choice that

1732
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:31,480
helps scaffold this therapeutic niche?

1733
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,388
And yeah, what policies can be taken

1734
01:23:35,554 --> 01:23:38,556
from the toolkit that is afforded in

1735
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:40,972
that moment based upon the training and

1736
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:43,824
the equipment available and so on, that

1737
01:23:43,862 --> 01:23:46,370
influence what to result in what.

1738
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,328
And that kind of comes back to this

1739
01:23:49,414 --> 01:23:52,832
synchrony for what question? Just

1740
01:23:52,886 --> 01:23:55,570
achieving synchrony is like a sort of

1741
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,012
undirected hypnosis or

1742
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:02,436
undirected sort of I don't know,

1743
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,696
it's just sort of like this vegetative

1744
01:24:05,888 --> 01:24:10,410
propagation of coordination that

1745
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,948
would only coincidentally be functional.

1746
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:17,770
So having a functional outcome in mind,

1747
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,644
then there can be a working backwards,

1748
01:24:20,692 --> 01:24:22,228
like well, what observations are we

1749
01:24:22,254 --> 01:24:24,812
looking for? And then what hidden states

1750
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:26,972
give rise to those observations? And

1751
01:24:27,026 --> 01:24:30,476
what policies exist that intervene in

1752
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,136
those hidden states and in the dynamics

1753
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:35,360
of how they change, recognizing their

1754
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:38,770
complexity? So those would just be a few

1755
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,744
active inference variables and

1756
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:44,610
approaches that are being invoked here

1757
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,316
conversationally. However, the kinds of

1758
01:24:49,338 --> 01:24:53,412
models and the empirical data to take it

1759
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:56,950
further are being sketched out.

1760
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:03,304
Well, it's going very fast and we're in

1761
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:06,024
kind of the home stretch. So what would

1762
01:25:06,062 --> 01:25:09,192
anyone like to look at or

1763
01:25:09,246 --> 01:25:12,220
turn to? We have a few other questions

1764
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:15,630
that previously had been raised that we

1765
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,636
didn't perhaps get to. Some of them

1766
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:23,036
are written here, so anything that

1767
01:25:23,058 --> 01:25:24,688
people see here that they're interested

1768
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:27,728
in or any other topic. And then also

1769
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:31,244
just how are we coming out of this dot?

1770
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,780
Two what will be different in our action

1771
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,988
as we are engaged in this area, of

1772
01:25:37,994 --> 01:25:39,028
course, from many different

1773
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:40,580
perspectives. George.

1774
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,404
I loved your kind of proposal, your

1775
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:50,484
summary of all those active inference

1776
01:25:50,532 --> 01:25:52,756
questions. In fact, there's a structure

1777
01:25:52,788 --> 01:25:54,330
for paper in it, right?

1778
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,384
It can take us down the road, even just

1779
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:01,120
sort of looking at some computational

1780
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:05,276
stuff. So creating some kind of a

1781
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:09,420
framework. Yeah, so I very much

1782
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:13,084
like it. I think there is a sort

1783
01:26:13,122 --> 01:26:17,064
of challenge and what are the latents

1784
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:20,476
and observables and so on to define

1785
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,648
those kind of things? That needs a

1786
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:22,770
little bit of thinking.

1787
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,468
The other stuff, I think, as you said,

1788
01:26:28,554 --> 01:26:32,230
probably working backwards would sort of

1789
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,550
becomes easier, isn't it?

1790
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,380
It is about hands on with reassurance

1791
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,856
and so on. If that's sort of what the

1792
01:26:42,878 --> 01:26:45,640
policy and so on and what we observed

1793
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:50,216
back at the beginning, I think it would

1794
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,564
be fascinating. I think in terms of the

1795
01:26:53,602 --> 01:26:55,836
bio behavioral kind of element of

1796
01:26:55,858 --> 01:26:59,452
synchrony, there's clearly changes in

1797
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,332
breathing, changes in probably heart

1798
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:05,090
rate variability and so on.

1799
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,256
That would be interesting to understand.

1800
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:13,136
Is that a sign that the system is sort

1801
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:16,992
of starting, changing the

1802
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:20,210
process? It talked about the thing,

1803
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,670
maybe something in the door of the room.

1804
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,724
A couple of years ago when I was

1805
01:27:26,762 --> 01:27:31,704
practicing in another country for

1806
01:27:31,742 --> 01:27:33,976
quite a few months, I used to use a lot

1807
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:36,472
of classical music and opera and so on.

1808
01:27:36,606 --> 01:27:39,604
And that was actually a tremendously

1809
01:27:39,652 --> 01:27:43,184
effective way of creating an environment

1810
01:27:43,252 --> 01:27:45,404
where the person sort of actually a form

1811
01:27:45,442 --> 01:27:47,340
of inducing that synchrony.

1812
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,084
I'm treating I'm kind of doing this

1813
01:27:51,122 --> 01:27:52,572
stuff. I don't need to talk that much.

1814
01:27:52,626 --> 01:27:55,580
I'm kind of just go with the sensations,

1815
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,664
go with the music. And I felt that

1816
01:27:57,702 --> 01:28:00,208
actually that was a very good way as a

1817
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:02,172
process of start changing the generative

1818
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:06,276
model. So there is the

1819
01:28:06,298 --> 01:28:10,112
stuff, as we kind of proposed

1820
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:13,124
on one of the recent papers, the stuff

1821
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:16,852
that you can implement. So if you doing

1822
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:18,692
the Tactile, the touch based

1823
01:28:18,746 --> 01:28:21,124
intervention and use forms of language

1824
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:24,632
sometimes to get the person

1825
01:28:24,686 --> 01:28:26,536
to visualize what you're doing, for

1826
01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:28,424
example, I'm doing this and I'm trying

1827
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:30,948
to achieve that. And you know that the

1828
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:33,928
person is even, like, interceptively

1829
01:28:34,024 --> 01:28:37,020
robust enough to let you explore the

1830
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:40,670
inner sensations to situations as

1831
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,144
you're probably doing some work. And you

1832
01:28:44,182 --> 01:28:46,752
realize by sort of predicting their

1833
01:28:46,806 --> 01:28:49,264
internal states that they're just

1834
01:28:49,302 --> 01:28:51,104
focusing too much and giving too much

1835
01:28:51,142 --> 01:28:54,050
attention to stuff which is actually not

1836
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,896
useful, where you can just say, oh, you

1837
01:28:56,918 --> 01:29:00,036
know what? Like we said in the paper, I

1838
01:29:00,058 --> 01:29:03,092
have a new dog. And where does the dog

1839
01:29:03,146 --> 01:29:06,116
come from? But a dog in that sense is a

1840
01:29:06,138 --> 01:29:10,312
way of sort of breaking down that

1841
01:29:10,366 --> 01:29:12,056
attention to what you're doing to sort

1842
01:29:12,078 --> 01:29:15,400
of say oh, okay, so you're continuing,

1843
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,764
there's still the sensory stimulation,

1844
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:20,084
there is still that sensory evidence

1845
01:29:20,212 --> 01:29:23,276
arriving to the system. But actually you

1846
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:26,376
start changing a little bit, you're

1847
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,024
flattening a little bit of the sensory

1848
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:31,372
state by sort of zeroing things and then

1849
01:29:31,506 --> 01:29:33,870
maybe those sensations that come in

1850
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,752
potentially kind of change some stuff.

1851
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:40,108
So yeah, I think at this level that's

1852
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:42,976
for sure some stuff to do.

1853
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:44,816
I think it's an interesting thing that

1854
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:48,950
actually started being explored now with

1855
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,830
Ted Kapchuk lab in Harvard around

1856
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,156
Acupuncture, which know looking at

1857
01:29:57,178 --> 01:29:59,312
synchrony as well with hyperscanning

1858
01:29:59,456 --> 01:30:01,944
techniques and kind of finding that

1859
01:30:01,982 --> 01:30:04,616
actually successful in terms of the

1860
01:30:04,638 --> 01:30:07,304
intervention is associated again, what

1861
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:11,388
synchrony. So kind of a

1862
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:14,076
body of evidence sort of building up, I

1863
01:30:14,098 --> 01:30:15,870
think quite nice.

1864
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,940
One thought on the free energy

1865
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,672
minimizing and ML Don and several others

1866
01:30:24,726 --> 01:30:27,424
were discussing in the chat about our

1867
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:30,156
biological systems truly finding global

1868
01:30:30,188 --> 01:30:32,544
minima. And so it's a big question, but

1869
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:35,904
just to give one thought on it is the

1870
01:30:35,942 --> 01:30:39,572
free energy is calculated for

1871
01:30:39,626 --> 01:30:43,476
a given policy sequence of actions in

1872
01:30:43,498 --> 01:30:46,576
terms of how informative that sequence

1873
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:49,224
of actions is expected to be and how

1874
01:30:49,262 --> 01:30:51,688
useful that sequence of action is

1875
01:30:51,774 --> 01:30:55,096
supposed to be expected to be. And so

1876
01:30:55,278 --> 01:30:58,404
different action pathways are evaluated

1877
01:30:58,532 --> 01:31:01,296
based upon their ability to reduce

1878
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:04,604
uncertainty or provide direct value.

1879
01:31:04,802 --> 01:31:06,856
And so if we can just maybe there's

1880
01:31:06,888 --> 01:31:09,036
multiple things that have value in the

1881
01:31:09,058 --> 01:31:12,076
therapeutic alliance, but one for the

1882
01:31:12,098 --> 01:31:14,236
generative model of the practitioner

1883
01:31:14,348 --> 01:31:16,768
might be like to reduce a number on a

1884
01:31:16,774 --> 01:31:20,256
pain survey that would be useful and

1885
01:31:20,278 --> 01:31:22,960
then there might be multiple policies

1886
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,476
and maybe adequacy is good enough. And

1887
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:31,604
if the pathways are to some

1888
01:31:31,722 --> 01:31:33,524
balance or shifting balance of

1889
01:31:33,562 --> 01:31:37,376
informative and useful, either reducing

1890
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:40,484
pain or helping understand how to reduce

1891
01:31:40,532 --> 01:31:44,676
pain, then navigating and shifting

1892
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,592
policies is something that can be done

1893
01:31:47,646 --> 01:31:49,608
adaptively. And then in contrast, the

1894
01:31:49,614 --> 01:31:51,324
policies that might want to be

1895
01:31:51,362 --> 01:31:53,436
disfavored would be like the ones that

1896
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:56,664
are adding confusion, reducing clarity

1897
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:59,630
of sense making or increasing pain.

1898
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,124
And that's not to say that there's not

1899
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:04,552
moments where transiently surprise does

1900
01:32:04,626 --> 01:32:07,712
increase or pain does increase, but that

1901
01:32:07,766 --> 01:32:09,776
is part of a policy like, I'm going to

1902
01:32:09,798 --> 01:32:13,564
touch this place, that might transiently

1903
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:15,216
increase pain, but that might be an

1904
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,656
informative action that in an extended

1905
01:32:18,688 --> 01:32:20,820
timeline is part of a free energy

1906
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:23,716
minimizing trajectory. And so what is

1907
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:27,156
the horizon and so on. George and

1908
01:32:27,178 --> 01:32:28,390
then anyone else?

1909
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,584
That thing sort of modifying pain,

1910
01:32:34,702 --> 01:32:37,096
modifying symptoms. It's quite an

1911
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,552
interesting thing because for example,

1912
01:32:38,606 --> 01:32:40,264
at least in my profession, there's this

1913
01:32:40,302 --> 01:32:42,536
idea that we don't treat the symptoms,

1914
01:32:42,568 --> 01:32:43,980
we treat the cause of the problem.

1915
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,744
Okay, so pain is just the symptoms,

1916
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:48,110
nothing to worry about.

1917
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,430
But from this perspective, actually

1918
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,008
changing symptoms, reducing symptoms is

1919
01:32:56,034 --> 01:32:57,408
actually an important thing, quite an

1920
01:32:57,414 --> 01:32:59,836
important thing. Particularly if you're

1921
01:32:59,868 --> 01:33:01,536
thinking about chronic conditions. If

1922
01:33:01,558 --> 01:33:03,184
you start making the person start

1923
01:33:03,222 --> 01:33:05,504
feeling a little bit better, then you

1924
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:09,156
probably start changing the

1925
01:33:09,178 --> 01:33:11,652
whole process. If you don't change

1926
01:33:11,706 --> 01:33:15,012
anything, how is the person going to

1927
01:33:15,146 --> 01:33:17,876
engage in that? If actually you can

1928
01:33:17,898 --> 01:33:20,484
continue saying you're moving much

1929
01:33:20,522 --> 01:33:22,552
better, your function is so much better,

1930
01:33:22,606 --> 01:33:24,696
but actually the person says, you know

1931
01:33:24,718 --> 01:33:26,696
what, but pine hasn't reduced at all.

1932
01:33:26,718 --> 01:33:29,768
I'm still in agony. I think going a

1933
01:33:29,774 --> 01:33:31,404
little bit with small things at that

1934
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:33,336
level are quite important in the greater

1935
01:33:33,368 --> 01:33:35,736
scheme of things in terms of changing

1936
01:33:35,768 --> 01:33:39,676
the generative model. So it

1937
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:44,016
is clearly a fundamental bit of

1938
01:33:44,038 --> 01:33:46,496
the jigsaw. And it's the same as you

1939
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:48,544
said, informing, for example, this might

1940
01:33:48,582 --> 01:33:51,152
be uncomfortable, but in fact is

1941
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:55,088
important in kind of

1942
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:58,384
achieving something. So the same way

1943
01:33:58,582 --> 01:34:01,484
some patients tell you it is painful,

1944
01:34:01,532 --> 01:34:04,576
but it's a good pain. So again, what's

1945
01:34:04,608 --> 01:34:05,988
the value of the good pain is, the

1946
01:34:05,994 --> 01:34:08,336
reward is a sort of anticipation that

1947
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:10,890
this will lead to a positive change.

1948
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,720
Thank you. Zoe?

1949
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,128
Yeah, I think George just kind of

1950
01:34:19,214 --> 01:34:23,032
touched upon what I was going to know.

1951
01:34:23,086 --> 01:34:25,836
Sometimes patients I know, I have

1952
01:34:25,858 --> 01:34:27,516
patients that come to a session and they

1953
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:30,236
expect it to be painful. I mean, a lot

1954
01:34:30,258 --> 01:34:33,576
of people expect that at some point they

1955
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:36,732
might get that sort of, quote,

1956
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,288
good pain where they almost

1957
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,736
want to feel like something's happening.

1958
01:34:42,838 --> 01:34:45,490
And whether that feedback is kind of

1959
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,564
pain or something, that's kind of

1960
01:34:48,602 --> 01:34:51,748
reassuring. I know patients, especially

1961
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,180
with sort of osteopathic, manipulative

1962
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,660
sort of treatment,

1963
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,252
they want the click. If someone

1964
01:35:01,306 --> 01:35:03,592
manipulates them, they come in and go,

1965
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:06,376
oh, I just want you to click me. And,

1966
01:35:06,478 --> 01:35:08,472
you know, the research shows that not

1967
01:35:08,526 --> 01:35:10,824
necessarily you need that sound, but

1968
01:35:10,862 --> 01:35:13,870
that feedback that they sort of want.

1969
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,750
They kind of want some people, they

1970
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,796
expect if you do a hard, sort of a

1971
01:35:20,818 --> 01:35:22,972
more firm massage, they feel like

1972
01:35:23,026 --> 01:35:24,408
they're, I don't know, getting their

1973
01:35:24,434 --> 01:35:26,224
money's worth or they're getting more

1974
01:35:26,342 --> 01:35:30,210
sort of treatment than if they want.

1975
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,736
They kind of want that feedback to say,

1976
01:35:32,758 --> 01:35:36,416
yeah, you're in the right place, and I

1977
01:35:36,438 --> 01:35:39,316
get that a lot. So I think pain is an

1978
01:35:39,338 --> 01:35:41,556
interesting one. I think the

1979
01:35:41,578 --> 01:35:44,740
biosynchrony that we get and we go upon,

1980
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,876
whether it is the patient's heart rate,

1981
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:50,136
their breathing changes, you see their

1982
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,652
facial expression changes or the muscle

1983
01:35:53,716 --> 01:35:55,944
tightens up nearby, you kind of go on

1984
01:35:56,062 --> 01:35:59,448
that. And I think it's what they expect

1985
01:35:59,534 --> 01:36:01,636
to get from treatment. Not every patient

1986
01:36:01,668 --> 01:36:04,328
is going to come in and go, yeah, I want

1987
01:36:04,334 --> 01:36:06,700
to be in less pain. That might not be

1988
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:08,808
their ultimate goal. Obviously they're

1989
01:36:08,824 --> 01:36:10,764
not going to say no to it, but they

1990
01:36:10,802 --> 01:36:13,116
might really just want to be able to

1991
01:36:13,138 --> 01:36:16,448
pick their kid up or go to sleep with

1992
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:18,256
just being able to go to sleep, not

1993
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:20,672
being in pain or not waking up or

1994
01:36:20,806 --> 01:36:22,752
something like that. So I think it's not

1995
01:36:22,886 --> 01:36:26,000
yes, we can clinically,

1996
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,756
it's not so simple as something that we

1997
01:36:28,778 --> 01:36:30,772
can measure imperatively. It might be

1998
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:33,940
something that a goal

1999
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,964
to that patient is more important than

2000
01:36:37,162 --> 01:36:39,216
if their pain is less or if they're

2001
01:36:39,248 --> 01:36:42,824
moving better or oh, well, yeah,

2002
01:36:43,022 --> 01:36:46,024
if we had the technology to say, look.

2003
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:47,992
Oh, look, your heart. Rate is lower. Or

2004
01:36:48,046 --> 01:36:49,796
this means that you're more efficient.

2005
01:36:49,908 --> 01:36:52,132
You're saving free energy because you're

2006
01:36:52,276 --> 01:36:55,496
not expending on your pain. Or you're

2007
01:36:55,528 --> 01:36:57,484
more efficient, so you'll have more

2008
01:36:57,522 --> 01:36:59,644
energy to do this. Now that you're doing

2009
01:36:59,682 --> 01:37:02,604
this better, they may not care. They may

2010
01:37:02,642 --> 01:37:04,044
just want to be able to pick their kid

2011
01:37:04,082 --> 01:37:08,208
up and not be in pain. So I think

2012
01:37:08,374 --> 01:37:10,096
what we're measuring, I think, will be

2013
01:37:10,118 --> 01:37:11,696
very individual to the patient and it

2014
01:37:11,718 --> 01:37:13,952
might not be something that is

2015
01:37:14,006 --> 01:37:16,450
necessarily useful in terms of research

2016
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:20,484
that we can quantify. It just might be

2017
01:37:20,602 --> 01:37:23,076
that goal that's not always sort of

2018
01:37:23,098 --> 01:37:26,004
empirical. Thank you,

2019
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:27,780
Zoe. Ian.

2020
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:35,192
Thanks. Thanks, all. And, yeah,

2021
01:37:35,246 --> 01:37:38,056
just as you were saying that, Zoe, you

2022
01:37:38,078 --> 01:37:39,976
said at the beginning, I think the

2023
01:37:39,998 --> 01:37:42,412
intention behind it all is to help them.

2024
01:37:42,546 --> 01:37:45,596
And I'm just thinking of a scenario or

2025
01:37:45,618 --> 01:37:49,576
some scenarios of when agreeing

2026
01:37:49,608 --> 01:37:51,768
on the goals is so important. So I'm

2027
01:37:51,784 --> 01:37:53,416
thinking short term goals and long term

2028
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:56,112
goals here. So clients who are maybe

2029
01:37:56,166 --> 01:37:59,330
endurance runners, and they want to do

2030
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:02,496
six ultramarathons a year and they come

2031
01:38:02,518 --> 01:38:04,012
to you because their calves are hurting,

2032
01:38:04,076 --> 01:38:06,764
so your immediate goal is to reduce the

2033
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:08,692
pain in their calves so they can make

2034
01:38:08,746 --> 01:38:10,708
the ultramarathon at the end of the

2035
01:38:10,714 --> 01:38:14,756
month. But then if

2036
01:38:14,778 --> 01:38:16,676
I'm aware as a therapist that there's a

2037
01:38:16,698 --> 01:38:19,608
link between endurance running and

2038
01:38:19,694 --> 01:38:21,192
developing arrhythmias, heart

2039
01:38:21,246 --> 01:38:23,256
arrhythmias, for example, and I see this

2040
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:26,884
person is very anxious about their goals

2041
01:38:27,012 --> 01:38:29,224
to the point where it's almost like they

2042
01:38:29,262 --> 01:38:33,096
need it rather than it's a

2043
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:36,604
pleasure. As such, then if

2044
01:38:36,642 --> 01:38:39,180
I disagree with their goal,

2045
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,692
are we am I true? You know, and saying,

2046
01:38:41,746 --> 01:38:44,128
actually, maybe four ultramarathons a

2047
01:38:44,134 --> 01:38:46,224
year would be enough for you. Am I just

2048
01:38:46,262 --> 01:38:49,804
enabling this drive by relieving

2049
01:38:49,852 --> 01:38:52,720
your calf pain in the short term?

2050
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:56,610
So I think agreeing on those

2051
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:01,696
more broader life goals or referring

2052
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:05,044
to someone else if I don't agree with

2053
01:39:05,082 --> 01:39:08,196
that, that's more

2054
01:39:08,218 --> 01:39:10,424
of an ethical issue. But it came to mind

2055
01:39:10,462 --> 01:39:13,384
as we were talking there. Yeah, that

2056
01:39:13,422 --> 01:39:16,164
reminds me of the kind of performances

2057
01:39:16,212 --> 01:39:19,304
that we might see in the Olympics or the

2058
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,196
medical care that might happen on the

2059
01:39:21,218 --> 01:39:23,596
sideline of a game where somebody has

2060
01:39:23,618 --> 01:39:26,140
been injured, but they're going to

2061
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:29,548
continue doing it almost in a

2062
01:39:29,554 --> 01:39:31,544
way that is rapidly degrading

2063
01:39:31,592 --> 01:39:33,984
potentially the future weeks of their

2064
01:39:34,022 --> 01:39:37,292
health. And then that's the ethical

2065
01:39:37,436 --> 01:39:39,040
challenge or the decision making

2066
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:42,976
challenge. Like is it worth them

2067
01:39:42,998 --> 01:39:46,076
to hobble across the finish line with an

2068
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:48,404
injury? That every step is just

2069
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:52,772
deteriorating the injury, but then being

2070
01:39:52,826 --> 01:39:55,268
consistent with a belief that one is a

2071
01:39:55,274 --> 01:39:58,936
finisher or even a signal to those who

2072
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,532
are watching. There's so many complex

2073
01:40:00,596 --> 01:40:03,290
phenomena at that level.

2074
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,090
Those are very interesting questions.

2075
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:13,500
Wow. So we're towards the end

2076
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:16,556
here, I guess for the authors and for

2077
01:40:16,578 --> 01:40:18,700
anyone else, we can give some of our

2078
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:21,756
last thoughts. What are some of your

2079
01:40:21,778 --> 01:40:25,664
next directions for this line of

2080
01:40:25,702 --> 01:40:26,930
research and application?

2081
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,610
Okay, well, first of all,

2082
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,664
as last time was a fascinating

2083
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:42,196
discussion, think kind of learning a

2084
01:40:42,218 --> 01:40:45,072
lot from this kind of interaction.

2085
01:40:45,216 --> 01:40:46,070
For sure.

2086
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,504
Within this we sort

2087
01:40:52,542 --> 01:40:55,448
of got some stuff done published in the

2088
01:40:55,454 --> 01:40:59,016
musculoskeletal side of things. We have

2089
01:40:59,038 --> 01:41:02,232
another paper to be submitted very soon,

2090
01:41:02,286 --> 01:41:05,016
the next week or so, the same topic,

2091
01:41:05,048 --> 01:41:07,016
but in pediatrics. And there's the bulk

2092
01:41:07,048 --> 01:41:10,076
of the other stuff building up. I think

2093
01:41:10,178 --> 01:41:12,590
what we want to achieve now is to start

2094
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,264
testing some of these ideas kind of

2095
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:20,930
empirically using different methods from

2096
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,700
qualitative kind of phenomenological

2097
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,596
type of approaches, trying to understand

2098
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:30,964
really what's going on to more sort

2099
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:36,100
of NeuroBio stuff.

2100
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:39,524
Kind of along the lines of looking at

2101
01:41:39,562 --> 01:41:43,252
for example, some markers of

2102
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:45,656
bio behavioral synchrony like for

2103
01:41:45,678 --> 01:41:46,250
example,

2104
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,996
physiological changes in both the

2105
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:54,940
practitioner and the patient.

2106
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,470
Bearing in mind some of this stuff.

2107
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,608
It is a bit more challenging to achieve

2108
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:04,600
because whereas for example, in the

2109
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:06,368
field of psychotherapy, the person

2110
01:42:06,534 --> 01:42:08,944
practitioner is typically sitting down,

2111
01:42:09,142 --> 01:42:11,952
the guy doing manual therapy is moving

2112
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:14,928
around. So therefore the heart rate is

2113
01:42:14,934 --> 01:42:16,692
not going to be exactly the same but

2114
01:42:16,826 --> 01:42:23,270
looking at what can be done and

2115
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,156
creating some models as well.

2116
01:42:27,178 --> 01:42:30,616
So the idea around computational stuff

2117
01:42:30,718 --> 01:42:35,096
also makes sense to test some

2118
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:38,376
of the ideas. This is work that is

2119
01:42:38,398 --> 01:42:42,252
building up. So we very much look

2120
01:42:42,306 --> 01:42:44,396
forward to kind of people getting in

2121
01:42:44,418 --> 01:42:47,564
touch, bouncing off ideas from

2122
01:42:47,602 --> 01:42:50,556
each other, kind of looking at how we

2123
01:42:50,578 --> 01:42:53,656
can move forward with this. It's not

2124
01:42:53,698 --> 01:42:57,104
osteopathic specific is more than

2125
01:42:57,142 --> 01:43:02,044
that. I think at least it can be manual

2126
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:05,724
therapy more broadening

2127
01:43:05,852 --> 01:43:10,964
along those lines. You can look at sort

2128
01:43:11,002 --> 01:43:13,396
of the role of some of this stuff in

2129
01:43:13,418 --> 01:43:16,310
chronic conditions, not just pain, but

2130
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,424
other persistent physical symptoms and

2131
01:43:20,462 --> 01:43:23,032
so on. So that's where we are. It's time

2132
01:43:23,086 --> 01:43:25,896
now to start kind of testing some of

2133
01:43:25,918 --> 01:43:27,892
this stuff for sure and stop writing

2134
01:43:27,956 --> 01:43:29,560
theoretical papers.

2135
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,940
Cool. Zoe?

2136
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:42,110
Yeah, sort of what George said.

2137
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:50,428
We've had one paper accepted for MSK,

2138
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:53,632
so hopefully that will come out for

2139
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:56,572
everyone to read soon. What is MSK.

2140
01:43:56,636 --> 01:43:59,040
We've got one waiting,

2141
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,860
so for more orthopedic

2142
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:14,804
general musculoskeletal muscle muscle

2143
01:44:14,852 --> 01:44:18,744
and bones kind of patients and

2144
01:44:18,782 --> 01:44:22,712
then the pediatrics one is almost ready

2145
01:44:22,766 --> 01:44:26,216
to submit. And then, yeah, I guess we'll

2146
01:44:26,248 --> 01:44:28,892
be looking towards seeing where it goes

2147
01:44:29,026 --> 01:44:31,420
and what we can sort of empirically

2148
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,156
prove from all the theories that are

2149
01:44:34,178 --> 01:44:38,512
kind of circulating and

2150
01:44:38,566 --> 01:44:40,764
going from there. But hopefully

2151
01:44:40,812 --> 01:44:43,616
discussions like what everyone said now

2152
01:44:43,638 --> 01:44:45,984
will give everyone more ideas to. Sort

2153
01:44:46,022 --> 01:44:50,004
of. Where we're going or where we could

2154
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:54,230
go, and different ways to apply the

2155
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,616
principles and the frameworks that we've

2156
01:44:57,648 --> 01:45:01,000
suggested so far. Awesome.

2157
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:05,332
George? Yeah. Just on the pediatrics,

2158
01:45:05,476 --> 01:45:08,516
we actually have one of the first lines

2159
01:45:08,548 --> 01:45:11,930
to start exploring is synchrony between

2160
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,700
mother, baby and practitioner.

2161
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,988
Starting with not sure if you're going

2162
01:45:18,994 --> 01:45:23,196
to we've been doing a

2163
01:45:23,218 --> 01:45:25,472
bit of work around the effect of touch

2164
01:45:25,526 --> 01:45:29,104
on premature babies. So we have those

2165
01:45:29,142 --> 01:45:31,164
collaborations with hospitals in Italy

2166
01:45:31,212 --> 01:45:33,264
would enable us to do some of that

2167
01:45:33,302 --> 01:45:36,370
stuff. But we sort of start looking also

2168
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,348
looking at this whole concept of

2169
01:45:39,514 --> 01:45:42,788
synchrony on a triadic kind of

2170
01:45:42,794 --> 01:45:45,076
thing so the baby, the practitioner and

2171
01:45:45,098 --> 01:45:47,204
the mother and see if actually if we

2172
01:45:47,242 --> 01:45:50,128
find that the synchrony actually between

2173
01:45:50,314 --> 01:45:54,696
mother and baby is a marker of for

2174
01:45:54,718 --> 01:45:59,352
example, the baby would be some

2175
01:45:59,406 --> 01:46:03,244
markers of autonomic change,

2176
01:46:03,442 --> 01:46:05,356
changes in autonomic arousal, for

2177
01:46:05,378 --> 01:46:07,804
example. Like we observed, for example,

2178
01:46:07,842 --> 01:46:10,664
the effect of effective touch, gentle

2179
01:46:10,712 --> 01:46:14,156
touch on the baby sat and so on. Thank

2180
01:46:14,178 --> 01:46:15,260
you, Ian.

2181
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,384
George, just as you were saying about

2182
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:23,392
the challenge of a practitioner being

2183
01:46:23,446 --> 01:46:27,368
moving whilst during a manual therapy

2184
01:46:27,404 --> 01:46:31,476
session and I'm sort of aware of how

2185
01:46:31,498 --> 01:46:34,740
that does lead to some difficulties,

2186
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,492
especially with the PPG sort of

2187
01:46:37,546 --> 01:46:39,460
measurement of heart rate variability.

2188
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:43,528
I heard just an idea I heard about, I

2189
01:46:43,534 --> 01:46:45,368
don't know if you've come across it a

2190
01:46:45,374 --> 01:46:49,316
wearable ECG that it's

2191
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:52,084
aimed at increasing respiratory sinus

2192
01:46:52,132 --> 01:46:54,988
arrhythmia. It vibrates and it

2193
01:46:54,994 --> 01:46:56,748
stimulates the person, catches them at

2194
01:46:56,754 --> 01:47:00,344
the top of their outbreath and it's

2195
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:01,976
designed to actually be used whilst

2196
01:47:02,008 --> 01:47:04,590
you're walking around in everyday life.

2197
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,616
So I'm just wondering if there's an

2198
01:47:07,638 --> 01:47:11,712
opportunity there because

2199
01:47:11,766 --> 01:47:15,564
it's designed to A, increase RSA

2200
01:47:15,612 --> 01:47:19,044
and B to be used whilst moving.

2201
01:47:19,162 --> 01:47:21,716
That might be an interesting piece of

2202
01:47:21,738 --> 01:47:23,030
kit to use.

2203
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,390
Yeah, absolutely.

2204
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,872
Cool. Blue or would anyone else

2205
01:47:30,926 --> 01:47:32,440
like any comments?

2206
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,410
I just want to give a final thought.

2207
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,376
So something that I'm going to be

2208
01:47:38,398 --> 01:47:40,424
thinking about for, I don't know,

2209
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:44,110
whoever knows how long is this idea of

2210
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,644
the emotional and physical body in

2211
01:47:49,682 --> 01:47:52,110
terms of reference point.

2212
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,552
Right, so we studied in, I think, Live

2213
01:47:55,606 --> 01:47:59,004
Stream 40, the FEP for Generic Quantum

2214
01:47:59,052 --> 01:48:02,850
Systems, and it talked about how

2215
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:07,956
the FEP drives entanglement and

2216
01:48:08,138 --> 01:48:10,564
in this way, when there's perfect

2217
01:48:10,682 --> 01:48:13,796
learning, there's this overlapping of

2218
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:16,676
the reference point. So I just wonder,

2219
01:48:16,778 --> 01:48:19,872
how can an emotional body and a physical

2220
01:48:19,936 --> 01:48:22,928
body be driven toward a more overlapping

2221
01:48:23,024 --> 01:48:26,152
reference frame when those things are so

2222
01:48:26,286 --> 01:48:28,408
fundamentally different? So I'm going to

2223
01:48:28,414 --> 01:48:29,610
be thinking about that.

2224
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,630
Cool. Very cool.

2225
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,620
All right, well, thank you for this

2226
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:42,488
excellent two. That concludes

2227
01:48:42,664 --> 01:48:46,204
44 and really appreciated the

2228
01:48:46,242 --> 01:48:48,796
authors joining. And Blue, thank you for

2229
01:48:48,818 --> 01:48:51,756
joining Ian, also for contributing so

2230
01:48:51,778 --> 01:48:55,324
much with the dot zero. And everyone is

2231
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:58,660
welcome back to give us updates on their

2232
01:48:58,730 --> 01:49:00,532
learning and application on this very

2233
01:49:00,586 --> 01:49:02,804
important area. So thanks again,

2234
01:49:02,842 --> 01:49:05,780
everybody. See you later. Thank you.

2235
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:07,776
Thank you. Goodbye.
