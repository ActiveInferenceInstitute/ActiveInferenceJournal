00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,800
welcome to the actinflab we're a

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,280
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
applied active inference

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
you can find us at the links on this

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,920
slide

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
this is recorded in an archive live

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
stream so please provide us feedback so

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
we can improve our work

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,879
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,280
welcome and we'll be following good

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
video etiquette for live streams and sid

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,480
thanks a ton for joining

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
really looking forward to this

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
conversation

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,119
if you want to learn more about active

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,840
lab activities check out

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,439
activeinference.org okay we're here in

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,799
active livestream number 42.0 and we are

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
starting to learn and discuss this paper

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
robot navigation as hierarchical active

27
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,479
inference

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
in the journal neural networks october

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
2021 it's by ozone catal timber bellin

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,600
tune van de mali bart dote and adam

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
saffron and some of whom we're looking

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,920
forward to speaking with in the upcoming

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,799
weeks

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
and this video is an introduction for

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
some of the ideas and just some

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
background and context and

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,240
rapidly assembled fun and memes

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,799
that we'll go through so it's just a

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
introduction of a discussion and we hope

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
that if you're watching live or later

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
that you can still

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,799
contribute to this and we're going to go

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,320
over the

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
main aims and claims of the paper

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
then the abstract roadmap and then walk

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
through some cool keywords in context

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
which will be great to hear students

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
perspective from working with robotics

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
which is an area that certainly i've

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
never actually been involved in so

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
going through some of the more applied

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
work that we're going to see with

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
robotics and also some of the more

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
formal aspects from active inference and

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
then this third vector that maybe we

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
both share which is some of the

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
biological basis of navigation so

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
we're going to just go into the

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,239
introductions first

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,840
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
california and all pass to sit so sid

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
i'll walk through your slides but yes

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
let's hear it

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
let's go to slide 9 and before i even

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
address myself

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
i would say

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,599
that we need to address the elephant in

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,200
the room that this is live stream number

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
42 which is one of my favorite numbers

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
and uh the favorite number for a lot of

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
people because it's the answer to life

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
universe and everything so um this is

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,680
the first time that i am

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
like coming to an active inference live

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
stream and i'm actively inferring the

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
whole idea of active inference itself

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
i'm very new to the field so um so yeah

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
i'm very excited to learn a lot of

79
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
things and yeah just as we are on this

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
slide right now 42 has a lot of other

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
references that you can check out um on

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
that wikipedia link

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
okay we're moving to the next slide um i

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
usually document like the many things

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
that i've been up to um

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,280
at this particular link and um in the

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,080
next slide i highlight uh like the few

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,560
uh places where i have had the fortune

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
to be at so i

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
formally have studied computer science

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
and design and um i've

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
like meandered um by accident and by

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,080
intention in a lot of different places

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
um that you can see here so i studied

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
computer science at a university in

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
india which practices a lot of hands-on

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,599
experience and that's where i got my

98
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
start in robotics and a lot of other

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,400
things then um and then studied

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
further um and through various

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
participatory workshops and internships

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,238
at space organizations media labs and

103
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
then spent two years at financial

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
services to understand how money works

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
and was introduced to robotics mostly

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
through open source software in the

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
bottom most thing that you see here

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
that's the google summer of code program

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
and i would go into more detail about

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,880
how that robotic journey even started

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
these days i'm very much interested in

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
how coordination happens and how

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
we can think about

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
security of um like countries and

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,280
communities in general and more

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
importantly all the emerging aspects of

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,840
society that's technology economics

118
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
culture and policy so i know that active

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
inference is a study of autonomous

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,280
behavior and we are moving into this era

121
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,600
where decentralized and autonomous

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
organizations are

123
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,720
like gaining a lot of popularity as well

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
as like mainstream acceptance uh

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
increasingly so it's very interesting to

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
see where this new field of study that's

127
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
active inference um that is a field that

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,600
is invented in our lifetime like it's

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
very rare to see that you get to explore

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,759
a field that

131
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,400
that is so recent and

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
has a long history like through

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
connections to other fields so it's

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
definitely an evolving area which can

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
help explore other evolving areas and

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
that's what i find very fascinating

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,800
about applying active inference in the

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
way that it's applied in this paper as

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
well so i'll try to explain like the

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
history of

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
robotics in a way through the

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,319
lens of my experience with it so one of

143
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
the first things

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
that i did when i started studying um so

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
as you can see i started studying in

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
2012 and immediately jumped into like

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,680
all the robotics labs that i could get

148
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,479
my hands on in university and one of the

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,400
first tasks that was

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
very

151
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,600
appealing to me was like multi-robot

152
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
teams like how do teams operate um that

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
teams have been like a constant

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,039
um like fascination for me throughout

155
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
life like human teams teams of um

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,240
biological organizing um like

157
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
organizations and organisms such as ants

158
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
and bees and then teams of um like

159
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,039
robots um and we derive a lot of

160
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
um like inspiration as well as a lot of

161
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,319
um

162
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
like biomimicry um kinds of techniques

163
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,680
in

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
multi-robot exploration as well so the

165
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
specific topic that we were studying is

166
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
in the next slide which is multi-robot

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,919
terrain exploration so if we go to slide

168
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,960
13

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
these were the different um like

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
techniques we were studying like just

171
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
like ants leave pheromone trails and

172
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,080
different signals for

173
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
other members of their colony

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
we tried to model these kinds of

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
similar techniques like recency like how

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
recent was it that a robot that was

177
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,039
covering a particular terrain that has

178
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,599
been um that hasn't been explored before

179
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,319
how recently was that covered so you can

180
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
imagine this as like a grid so a

181
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,240
two-dimensional grid and you see the

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,960
green squares those are the multi-robot

183
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
teams so the green square represents a

184
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
robot and they are trying to explore and

185
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,479
map out this entire area as a team and

186
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
the assumption is that they can

187
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
communicate amongst themselves and in

188
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
certain cases they cannot so

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,919
the red

190
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,400
squares represent obstacles and you will

191
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
see a similar obstacle map in this paper

192
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
which in which they use a warehouse

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
but we were using similar

194
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
similarly configured different obstacle

195
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
maps both in a simulated environment as

196
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,599
well as a physical environment so

197
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,440
we explored different approaches back

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
then which is

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
things like just representing them as an

200
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
automata like giving them very simple

201
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
deterministic rules which they can

202
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
follow and those could be imagined as

203
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
simply as conveys game of life like the

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,199
glider pattern or similar patterns that

205
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,599
you might know and then we moved on to

206
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,479
more animal inspired or bio-inspired

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
techniques which is

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
a technique like recency

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,080
in which

210
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,479
the robot leaves pheromone trails in

211
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
each square and each square has like a

212
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
countdown timer how recently was it

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
visited by any other robot so this can

214
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
be understood as ants leaving trails

215
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,640
which decay over time and this gives

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,519
other ants an idea of how to

217
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
like map that surrounding region

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
effectively and then there were very

219
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
simple approaches which were more suited

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
for the digital world such as simply

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
node counting that how many

222
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
robots have visited this node before so

223
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
every time you visit any square you just

224
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
increase its count visit count by one so

225
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,480
that helps the robots in understanding

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
okay this area has been visited five

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
times and the surrounding squares have

228
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
only been visited two times so i should

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
maybe explore the unexplored regions

230
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
first so these were different techniques

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,839
that were used and

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,640
we

233
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,519
moved on uh published a few papers and

234
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,959
were also inspired by military

235
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
organization techniques the typical ooda

236
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
loop or the observe orient decide an act

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
which is kind of

238
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
applied active inference in a way

239
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,240
so

240
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
we did

241
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,760
we did explore that like clustering

242
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
approaches and different ways of

243
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
conquering the whole map so this was an

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
exploration and exploitation problem

245
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
that um that i had like the opportunity

246
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
to study in like second and third year

247
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
so of my undergraduate computer science

248
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,640
and then i went on to

249
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
um like fancier things thanks to the

250
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
google summer of code program so this

251
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
was a project with the italian mars

252
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
society which reports to the european

253
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
space agency and here it's it was more

254
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
about autonomous navigation working with

255
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,040
a human so this was a robot and a human

256
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
team working together

257
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
and the next slide shows um

258
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
like how it actually happened so if we

259
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
go to the next slide and play the video

260
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
um we will see that

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
that it is meant for an astronaut who is

262
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,519
safe in a martian habitat and the robot

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
is a rover which is

264
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
exploring the martian terrain outside in

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
a more dangerous environment so every

266
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
movement of the rover comes from

267
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
the astronauts movements which are

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
mapped from an omnidirectional treadmill

269
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
that the astronaut is walking on and

270
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,360
similarly there's feedback received from

271
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,079
the rover's camera which feeds into the

272
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,440
astronauts virtual reality headset so do

273
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
note that this was back in 2015 when

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
headsets were clunky when

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
things moved very slowly but kinect was

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
all the rage like mapping body movements

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,640
mapping um like um

278
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,880
robot movements in an unexplored

279
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
territory using 3d cameras which is uh

280
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
which is a technique that this paper

281
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
also uses using

282
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
rgb and depth cameras um so those were

283
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
the techniques which still

284
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
are very popularly used even today so

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,920
this was my introduction to

286
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
understanding how

287
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,959
different

288
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,440
like robot and human teams can work and

289
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
how tele-robotics and tele-presence can

290
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,240
work so my responsibility in this

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,639
project was to do the entire networking

292
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,360
architecture and ensure that there's no

293
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
latency or there's no feedback in which

294
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
a robot can enter a dangerous state just

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
because the astronaut did not receive

296
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,639
the information on time so

297
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,920
this is how we began and the

298
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
operating system that we used in that

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
particular experiment is on slide 16

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
so whenever the video is done we can

301
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,399
move to the next slide so

302
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,040
in slide 16 you see a husky

303
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
robot so these are open source robots

304
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
that are very popularly used with the

305
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
robot operating system and we'll keep

306
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
coming back to this particular

307
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,880
framework of ross so ross became

308
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,600
extremely popular it gains its

309
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
reputation from the earliest darpa

310
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,399
challenges in which a very popular car

311
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,120
uh they just crossed through a through

312
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
an entire desert terrain navigating

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
autonomously so ross was an open source

314
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
robotics library

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
which was built out of that and you see

316
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
many different

317
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,760
sensors and actuators on this particular

318
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
rover so you see a lot of symbols which

319
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
will be repeated in this particular

320
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,200
paper paper as well so the task of a

321
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
localization technique is to gather all

322
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
these sensor inputs fuse all those

323
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
inputs so the sensors can be understood

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,440
as imu or

325
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
like measurement units inertial

326
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,639
measurement units such as like

327
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,680
accelerometers and speed and all those

328
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
measurement metrics then you have camera

329
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,839
which is similarly um rgb that's red

330
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,120
green blue

331
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
colors of

332
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
the visible spectrum

333
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
and then you have 3d sensing um in the

334
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
in the sense

335
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,279
of the kinect sensor that you see on

336
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,519
that particular robot and you would see

337
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
a similar setup in this paper as well

338
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
they use a turtle bot to wire robot

339
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
which we will which we will get into

340
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,560
which is also using ross and it uses the

341
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,800
same concepts as we used in that

342
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
particular paper so all these different

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
attributes such as gps 3d sensing

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,839
odometry camera and imu are

345
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
inputs to the robot localization

346
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
technique and all of this together is

347
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
meant to estimate the three-dimensional

348
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
surroundings of a particular robot and

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,279
all these techniques do not use active

350
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,600
inference they used probabilistic

351
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
methods which we will slightly refer in

352
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
the paper so it's very promising to see

353
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
um that if we are inspired so much from

354
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,519
biological ways of navigation we

355
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,079
we should rather use a technique which

356
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,560
like organisms have evolved

357
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,399
to be so effective at

358
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,760
like over so many years and as humans

359
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,839
wayfinding was considered a survival

360
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,959
skill for a long long time before we

361
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,440
entered the era of google maps and we

362
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,959
just totally lost like the technique of

363
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
finding our way around rural um urban

364
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
and natural settings so

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
wayfinding and navigation and

366
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
localization and mapping was a technique

367
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
which um is very familiar to anyone in

368
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
their 70s or 80s if you ask them

369
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
how would you find your way around a

370
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,199
city block or the jungle they will have

371
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
their own ways of navigating that so

372
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
they will

373
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
either use natural cues like wind

374
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,519
direction uh the way the sun is setting

375
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
the map that they have already covered

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
asking people around so these kinds of

377
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
techniques

378
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,959
are built in our human brain and it's

379
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,600
very natural for animals to

380
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
use that as well in urban as well as

381
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
their own natural environments so this

382
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
paper goes into these big many big

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
questions which is in the next slide

384
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
slide number 17 so

385
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
over to daniel um

386
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,320
where he

387
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
illustrates all these wonderful

388
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
connections

389
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
good thanks for the

390
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
innovation on the live stream

391
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
format a lot of fascinating background

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
and

393
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
it sets us up really well to discuss

394
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
some of the big questions of this paper

395
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
and some of the big questions in general

396
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,279
so

397
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,560
one big question

398
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
just the kind of thing that would bring

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
somebody to want to even read this 2021

400
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
paper or future work is how do

401
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,680
biological

402
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,240
like evolved and human created

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,440
mathematical statistical and robotic so

404
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
several different kinds of human created

405
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,399
entities how do biological and human

406
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,199
created entities engage in actionable

407
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,079
tractable adaptive navigation in complex

408
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,720
conditional and changing landscapes and

409
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
that's a question that one could ask

410
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
about everything from the organismal

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,480
level

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,880
to the colony level

413
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
arguably also an organism but in a

414
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,639
little different way and all manner of

415
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,680
biological systems and then here is a

416
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
really nice slide from this bill ant

417
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
robotics project where they did a direct

418
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
side to side of the harvester ants

419
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,600
anatomy

420
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
and also their robots anatomy and that's

421
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
kind of like a bridge that takes us into

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
a different space first with the walking

423
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
around the warehouse and does it does it

424
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,679
stay standing when it gets pushed and

425
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
can it localize when somebody turns off

426
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
the light in the room and these sort of

427
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
basic

428
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
um though still relatively advanced but

429
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,280
also relatively

430
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
basic

431
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
tasks and settings

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,839
and then off on the right side here

433
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
are some of the visions and

434
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,240
representations that people use for when

435
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
those low-level activities are such that

436
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
if a robot can resist being pushed over

437
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
then how does that have complex

438
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
feedbacks with society so

439
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
it was just something that you also

440
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
impressed upon like the very holistic

441
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
nature of this area and also just how to

442
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
keep a lot

443
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,960
on

444
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
the table talking about it so that's

445
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,880
what will be fun to talk about what do

446
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,760
you think

447
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
yeah

448
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,520
i think before we enter into the paper

449
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,919
itself i would want to understand from

450
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,000
you like what has been your learning

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
from

452
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
observing and behavior and studying

453
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,960
their

454
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
actions in such an environment

455
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
like in natural as well as

456
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
artificial environments

457
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
i can

458
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
hopefully accurately relay an anecdote

459
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
for my phd advisor professor deborah

460
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,600
gordon

461
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
and she would often talk about how there

462
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
would be at a conference or some type of

463
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,919
competition and this is something i've

464
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,720
observed but to a lesser smaller extent

465
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
is there'll be a presentation of an

466
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
algorithm or a robotics implementation

467
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
of so-called swarm algorithm or ant

468
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
colony algorithm ant colony optimization

469
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
we see it on the

470
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
pure optimization or computer only but

471
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
also a lot of bio-inspired robotics

472
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
design

473
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,240
and

474
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
one common feature of these algorithms

475
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,080
is that there's some like underlying map

476
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
that's shared like when you mentioned

477
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,520
the grid counting of course there has to

478
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,039
be like a mesh network so that the

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
robots kind of have basically either

480
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
telepathy or some kind of common signal

481
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,760
even if it's asynchronous or something

482
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
like that but there has to be some sort

483
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,880
of like updating it of the grid in their

484
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,679
mind

485
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,480
and

486
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,440
being in the field and also drawing upon

487
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
what we know about what we know about

488
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
ants the nest mate when it's deciding to

489
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
forage or not it doesn't know how many

490
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
seeds the colony has how many seeds are

491
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,679
out there what the right decision would

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
be so it must use stochastic

493
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
interactions that it receives locally

494
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,200
and cognitive constraints to make its

495
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,320
decision

496
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
and then once it's out there there's no

497
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,000
telepathy amongst the ants there's no

498
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,720
queen control there's no forager groups

499
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
that all like tell each other orders and

500
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
all of that so

501
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
that navigation is also multi-sensory

502
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
and related to their cognitive

503
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
constraints but also their finesse in a

504
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
certain niche and a harvester ant is not

505
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,559
gonna forge well in the arctic and so

506
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
understanding how it's that interplay

507
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,880
between the nest mate and the colony and

508
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
the variability of the environment it's

509
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
a really rich area and it's easy to

510
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,159
bring in

511
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,919
other

512
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,840
modalities that humans can use like

513
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
long-range communication

514
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,320
and understanding how those novel

515
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,080
affordances for decentralized systems

516
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,120
design

517
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
do or don't relate to some of the ways

518
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
that biological systems work that's a

519
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
really fascinating area

520
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,600
yeah

521
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
and

522
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,559
the reason i think that this paper is

523
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,400
relevant first of all

524
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
because it's um based on active

525
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760
inference which is uh like the

526
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,919
study of how the human brain would react

527
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
in certain scenarios but more broadly

528
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
how a biological organ like organism or

529
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
an organized colony would react in those

530
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
kinds of situations and

531
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
just like you said

532
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
the map may not be shared in certain

533
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
cases um the map

534
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
the team might be decentralized

535
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,679
communication might be

536
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
unavailable these are extremely

537
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
realistic situations even for groups of

538
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,919
robots

539
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,440
today so

540
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,679
now you can imagine these as

541
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,880
robots who are exploring

542
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
the fallout of a nuclear

543
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
um situation um like when a nuclear

544
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
plant needs to undergo maintenance um

545
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
and humans cannot enter that area so you

546
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
cannot assume 100 communication when the

547
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
robot is mapping out that area so

548
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,679
this is one of the important reasons why

549
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,720
some amount of cognition and some amount

550
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
of

551
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
active inference of the terrain is

552
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
extremely important and our

553
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,360
infrastructure in robotics as well as

554
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
communication is only now getting there

555
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,159
like with the new standards introduced

556
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,039
in 5g and 6g networks we will start

557
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,320
getting into like scenarios where robots

558
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
become parts of our daily lives and they

559
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,200
already have so i'm based in singapore

560
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
and it's very common to see cleaner

561
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,520
robots and teams of

562
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,080
like helper robots moving around

563
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
like in university campuses as well as

564
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
airports and shopping centers so

565
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
these

566
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,360
robots

567
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
have covered the entire terrain already

568
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,240
so they use um like very basic

569
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,120
approaches of obstacle avoidance and

570
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
trying to clean the entire area and

571
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
complete their objectives

572
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,159
and

573
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
there is very little stochastic

574
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
action going on there because most of

575
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
those tasks can be completed in a

576
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
hard-coded map that is shared among

577
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,159
those um robot teams in a very specific

578
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,320
highly connected environment but when we

579
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,679
start moving into more urban

580
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
environments where this cannot be

581
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,320
guaranteed we definitely need approaches

582
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,039
like the one described in this paper so

583
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
so yeah with all that context we can

584
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
jump into the aims and claims of this

585
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,039
paper

586
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,600
awesome so just to read some of the aims

587
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
and claims which we're going to revisit

588
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,080
a bunch the paper is robot navigation as

589
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,559
hierarchical active inference and some

590
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,799
of their main claims were that they are

591
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,280
going to first propose a hierarchical

592
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
generative model casting navigation as

593
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
minimizing expected variational free

594
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
energy so that is what brings all of

595
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
these areas of navigation robotics

596
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
under the umbrella or drawing an edge to

597
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,159
active inference framework

598
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,400
we show how perception localization

599
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,159
mapping and navigation naturally emerge

600
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,240
from optimizing this hierarchical

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
generative model under active inference

602
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,159
so that's sort of the theory and

603
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,240
background and some of the formalisms

604
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,600
that we'll go through

605
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,120
then they implement the system in silico

606
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
on a real world robot platform

607
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
navigating a warehouse environment using

608
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,919
camera sensor input only

609
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
and then they also have this third angle

610
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,279
not just the theoretical and the robotic

611
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
implementation of that

612
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
but the biological and they relate their

613
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
work to various findings and hypotheses

614
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,919
in biology about navigation in the

615
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,880
rodent and primate brain

616
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,919
okay

617
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,760
um yeah

618
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
do you wanna i mean read that yeah these

619
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,559
are

620
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,559
wonderful claims before we jump into the

621
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
claims i was very fascinated by like the

622
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
list of authors of the paper so i'll

623
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
just zoom into that a bit if that's

624
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,720
visible on the slide

625
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
so

626
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
so you see that three three of those

627
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,559
authors are um located in belgium and

628
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,520
the

629
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
last author really fascinated me because

630
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
they come from a center of psychedelic

631
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,600
and consciousness research which happens

632
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,720
to be one of my favorite facilities in

633
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
the entire world focusing on these kinds

634
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,120
of topics so

635
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
i would also like to ask you that how do

636
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,679
these uh kinds of

637
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,799
like multi-disciplinary research um like

638
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,799
show through in this particular paper so

639
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,720
obviously we have teams of engineers and

640
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
researchers from belgium but we also

641
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
have an author from a very different

642
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
field and how do you think that

643
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,520
contributed in this paper

644
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
that'll be something great to ask them

645
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
when they visit but i think at the

646
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,919
general level we see

647
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,320
uh several factors including like of

648
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
course a shared interest common

649
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,360
framework in active inference

650
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,719
also i'm sure some uh

651
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,279
well to point out in this specific case

652
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,120
but it's a great question and it's an

653
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,880
important question

654
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
okay so

655
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,520
um

656
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,840
[Music]

657
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
i'll read the abstract first half and

658
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,039
then

659
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
or the first three localization and

660
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,080
mapping has long been a standing up

661
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,600
localization and mapping has been a

662
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
long-standing area of research both in

663
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,039
neuroscience

664
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
to understand how mammals navigate their

665
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,120
environment as well as in robotics to

666
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
enable autonomous mobile robots in this

667
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,679
paper we treat navigation as inferring

668
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,200
actions that minimize expected

669
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
variational free energy under a

670
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,679
hierarchical generative model we find

671
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,840
that familiar concepts like perception

672
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,880
path integration localization mapping

673
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
naturally emerged from this active

674
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,279
inference formulation

675
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,279
moreover we show that this model is

676
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
consistent with models of hippocampal

677
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
functions and can be implemented in

678
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,600
silico on a real world robot

679
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
our experiments illustrate that a robot

680
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
equipped with our hierarchical model is

681
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
able to generate topologically

682
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,039
consistent maps

683
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
and correct navigation behavior is

684
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,960
inferred when a goal location is

685
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
provided to the system

686
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
yeah i mean that's a lot to get into so

687
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,600
yeah i mean

688
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
so the paper makes a very simple claim

689
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,919
like if we broadly look at the paper it

690
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,159
makes a very simple claim that active

691
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,799
inference works and it's able to

692
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,240
consistently reproduce maps which are

693
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,440
representative of the physical world map

694
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,640
so

695
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
this also goes into

696
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
this literally goes into the map is not

697
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
the terrain um kind of discussion that

698
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,840
we have been having in active inference

699
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
live streams and

700
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
in this case they are able to

701
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
consistently reproduce a particular kind

702
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
of map that is a warehouse kind of a

703
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,799
setting and they compare it with many

704
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,640
different approaches and

705
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,480
there's many different tasks that you

706
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,279
can see here so the highlighted tasks

707
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,440
tell you that there's perception which

708
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
is understanding the entire environment

709
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,799
then

710
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,880
combining all the parts that can be

711
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,960
taken from point a to point b

712
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,399
and then

713
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,880
localization which is understanding your

714
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
own position as a robot in that

715
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
particular environment

716
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,919
and then mapping as you are doing all of

717
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,320
these things simultaneously localizing

718
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,120
your position and state as well as

719
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
mapping um the entire region um while

720
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,880
you're doing that and all of these are

721
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
naturally emerging from

722
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
like formulating it as um like active

723
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
inference which is

724
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
minimizing uh expected variational free

725
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,080
energy so um so yeah just before we go

726
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
into uh more detail like do you want to

727
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
explain to robotics

728
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,159
researchers who might visit this live

729
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,320
stream about why they should

730
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,559
care about variational free energy and

731
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,120
probably these new words that

732
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
that might be very important for them

733
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,159
nice thanks for that

734
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,960
very clear summary and definitely we

735
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
hope that this kind of a presentation at

736
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
least in the dot zero and also in the

737
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,799
group discussions it's like a two-way

738
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,159
street so people are going to have

739
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
different amounts of familiarity with

740
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,559
some of the robotics as well as with the

741
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,799
active inference so to anyone who's

742
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,520
anywhere in that space

743
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,600
i think there's a lot to be said for

744
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
just taking a first principles approach

745
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,919
that's sort of a simplicity in elegance

746
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,799
route there's value to be found in

747
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,360
transdisciplinary approaches like

748
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,279
localization and mapping

749
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,279
and cognitive affects

750
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,760
and emotion some of the psychological

751
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,039
frameworks that we've been discussing in

752
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,279
other live streams or other papers and

753
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,080
so

754
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,399
there's value in not just simplicity but

755
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,880
in finding connections like complexity

756
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
and patterns across systems

757
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,760
and

758
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
i think also for something that is

759
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
clearly so nascent in its development to

760
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
be able to

761
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,279
as sid is describing

762
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,279
have some functional

763
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,360
closure of maps

764
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,320
and cast this problem of like

765
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
where is one and how should one act and

766
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
what is the bigger space map look like

767
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,039
and all of those things which as

768
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,320
discussed in the real world have all

769
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,279
these other

770
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
challenges like the communication of

771
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
those maps and everything however just

772
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,320
at the individual wayfinding route

773
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,799
drawing on first principles from biology

774
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,559
and being a part of a conversation

775
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,240
that's clearly already functional but

776
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
also has a lot of potential is probably

777
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,080
a good thing to at least listen to

778
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
okay so how do they

779
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
do that

780
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
here's the roadmap

781
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
in the beginning they introduced the

782
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,080
problem and some of the background just

783
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
like we've done in these last minutes

784
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
they then discuss some biological

785
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
perspectives on navigation

786
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
they then formulate in sections three

787
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
and four

788
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,600
the hierarchical active inference model

789
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
for navigation it's going to be a two

790
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,440
layer model and we're going to go into

791
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
it a lot and there'll be colors that are

792
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,919
consistently associated with the levels

793
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,399
they then discuss the experiments which

794
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,679
is the implementation the mm robot

795
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,159
embodiment of the robot and then they

796
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,360
have some discussion

797
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,919
okay yeah

798
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,840
yeah before we enter into each of these

799
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,120
specific uh topics um like i would share

800
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,679
what i had shared with um daniel a week

801
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,559
ago when we were started um

802
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,399
approaching this paper so

803
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
i mean this paper is exceptionally well

804
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
written even if you're not from any of

805
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
these fields so

806
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,200
just um looking at like the language

807
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
that's used it's

808
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
very easy to follow for the most part

809
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
and they make references to

810
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,519
like topics which

811
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,360
people will be familiar with so they

812
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
explain active inference um free energy

813
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,720
and all these different concepts of slam

814
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,679
and very technical terms in an extremely

815
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
um simple language which which is why i

816
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,279
think it's a great paper uh to start

817
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
with if you are new to either of these

818
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,640
fields robotics or active inference

819
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,760
very true because i know i was

820
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
looking up a lot of robot citations

821
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,440
watching videos and learning a lot

822
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,039
because it's just totally not my area

823
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,039
and i can imagine somebody with a

824
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,159
different background would have a

825
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,399
different experience so it's i agree an

826
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,440
awesome written paper and it exists for

827
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,279
anyone who wants to go into more detail

828
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:57,919
and

829
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,279
check out the citation networks if

830
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,360
you're in the future

831
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,760
uh they listed several keywords active

832
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
inference robot navigation

833
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
deep learning slam simultaneous

834
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,840
localization and mapping and then

835
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,399
ratslam which is a biologically inspired

836
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,279
version of slam so let's just go to your

837
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,360
active inference meme

838
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
if you would like to give a real time

839
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,039
meme reading please feel free to

840
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,279
yeah so the meme explains itself and

841
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,919
this is uh essentially

842
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,960
the teaching robots like um

843
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,360
as if you're teaching a child and i

844
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
think that is uh essentially what all

845
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,679
kinds of learning techniques come down

846
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,880
to and there was another meme of uh like

847
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,360
a toddler reading neural networks for

848
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,600
babies which is not in this presentation

849
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
but uh that meme essentially

850
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
meant that a neural network is learning

851
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,360
how neural networks work um so this meme

852
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,320
is inspired by that that in order to

853
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
solve a particular purpose you need to

854
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,120
infer actively which means you need to

855
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,360
firstly be active and that's the first

856
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,320
condition and the second condition is

857
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,960
that you need to be constantly inferring

858
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,200
uh like your own assumptions about the

859
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
environment uh about um the observations

860
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,000
that have

861
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,880
uh

862
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,360
transpired in the last few time steps

863
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,000
and then continue to do both these steps

864
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
in a loop and in that combination of

865
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,399
those two loops

866
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
you are able to solve that purpose so

867
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,960
the meme is inspired from rick and morty

868
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,159
in which the only sole purpose of that

869
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,880
robot is to pass butter uh and in this

870
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
case uh

871
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
that sole purpose of just uh

872
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
implementing active inference in a robot

873
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
is all that's needed to solve that

874
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,480
particular

875
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,200
task and that is intended for the claim

876
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,120
of the paper so that is why active

877
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,360
inference as a whole i think is

878
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,240
um like all encompassing when it comes

879
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,120
to

880
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
like doing all the steps that we covered

881
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,600
in the last seconds

882
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,639
i'll only comment on what you said

883
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,679
because it's so true that as a holistic

884
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,639
and composable model it'd be possible to

885
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
bring in different sensor modalities

886
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,639
different communication

887
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,320
connectivities

888
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,119
different actuator possibilities and

889
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,960
active inference could

890
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,159
grow

891
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,399
in terms of how it's being used so this

892
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,320
is like uh

893
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,918
relative to some other possible

894
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,199
algorithms which would have to be

895
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,679
composed in a bit of an ad hoc or in

896
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,719
principled way this is a way to explore

897
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,520
just that that u infer actively could be

898
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
for the

899
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,159
robot

900
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,239
in condition a or the robot in condition

901
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
b depending on the generative model and

902
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,800
the markov blanket and the external

903
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,079
states in the world itself in the

904
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,320
context so

905
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,040
um let's just go straight into the meme

906
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,000
analysis of this second video meme you

907
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
have prepared

908
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,200
yeah

909
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,480
meme analysis is something new

910
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
that might be unique for this live

911
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
stream at least in this

912
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
animated format and

913
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,839
as you can see in this particular meme

914
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,920
and in the previous beam that a robot

915
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
has to forget all their existing slam

916
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
techniques that

917
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
robots have popularly used so we go into

918
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
many different techniques that are cited

919
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
in the paper so one of those techniques

920
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
is obviously rat slam which we will go

921
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,359
into next but um probabilistic robotics

922
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,680
is like this popular book this classical

923
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
book which was used by robots of the

924
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,520
last decade or two and it describes many

925
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,760
different approaches of how slam can be

926
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
implemented and all techniques that we

927
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,440
see

928
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,839
in conventional robots today whether

929
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,800
it's

930
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
like a robot that's cleaning your house

931
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
or a robot that's serving you food in

932
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
one of those experimental restaurants

933
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,440
all of them use probabilistic

934
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
robotics techniques and

935
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,040
this meme in particular goes into

936
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,960
firstly the mission of this entire

937
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
participatory lab which is act infer and

938
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
serve and once you do that once you do

939
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,119
all these three things as a robot you're

940
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
able to successfully navigate your way

941
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,359
around these

942
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,359
very confusing terrains which might be

943
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,800
complex and

944
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
dynamic

945
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,240
and on the top you have a diagram which

946
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,720
describes how deep learning methods

947
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
typically work and how this paper

948
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,000
implements one of those techniques with

949
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
an active inference flavor on top of it

950
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,440
so

951
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,560
dan do you want to describe uh like

952
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,400
how active inference and deep learning

953
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,480
like how this

954
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640
like combination of these two

955
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
fields has come through in this paper

956
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,079
sure first i'll

957
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,560
uh interpret the meme and then describe

958
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,839
the deep learning but then we'll get

959
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,599
into the more details as we actually

960
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,400
walk through the paper so i see the the

961
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,200
act and first serve of actin flab which

962
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
is open to anybody who wants to

963
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,839
participate

964
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,200
and then it's a little bit like the

965
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
experiment where people are passing

966
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
basketballs to each other and then

967
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
something unexpected crosses the screen

968
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,119
and many people will not report seeing

969
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,119
that other thing crossing the screen but

970
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
there's a lot of analogies to other

971
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,040
cognitive contexts so it's like we're

972
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,560
focused in the lab but then also we

973
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,960
have to be aware of the unknowns and the

974
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,440
unexpected and the anomalies within the

975
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,520
anomaly space and then that's how we get

976
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,400
to four

977
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,599
which is like

978
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,040
the tetrahedra which is bigger than just

979
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,839
us

980
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,280
anyone so how to be doing that nestmate

981
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
thing

982
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
that we can juggle and three numbers in

983
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,320
our head at once or seven numbers in our

984
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
head at once or can only grab two things

985
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,680
at once or even fewer so how do we

986
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,760
actually use these limitations that we

987
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
have and be part of still a bigger

988
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
navigation so it's nice meme basically

989
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,640
this paper is going to present a method

990
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,200
that uses some

991
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
model structures from active inference

992
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
but also uses some

993
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,640
more

994
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,079
mainstream deep learning and machine

995
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,680
learning techniques

996
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
and those methods we'll talk about more

997
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
like the specifics of how they're

998
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
combined but it contains both things

999
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,119
that are like machine learning neural

1000
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,839
network type approaches as well as that

1001
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,720
being structured in an active inference

1002
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,680
way

1003
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,079
and that active inference structure when

1004
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,920
it's just with simple matrices can be

1005
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,480
looked at like in the model stream one

1006
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
or in active inference a step-by-step

1007
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,560
guide that's the very simple matrix

1008
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,160
multiplication

1009
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,960
very austere kernel of the active

1010
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
infrastructuring and then here because

1011
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,200
some of the data includes like video

1012
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
data and it's being implemented on

1013
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,280
modern hardware it does have like a deep

1014
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,440
learning machine learning aspects and

1015
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
modules to it

1016
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,520
okay so here's slam finally finally the

1017
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,880
keywords

1018
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,480
so

1019
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
researching it i found this paper are we

1020
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
ready for service robots

1021
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,520
and presenting a data set for slam

1022
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
and on the bottom right it's showing

1023
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
some different scenes as well as how

1024
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,359
they change

1025
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,920
and the paper concludes that with

1026
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
respect to this challenge of

1027
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,240
simultaneous localization and mapping

1028
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
that various factors can often confuse a

1029
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
robot and so one can imagine this is

1030
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,359
just like an algorithm that has a blind

1031
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,200
spot or some sort of area of poor

1032
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,440
performance for any number of reasons

1033
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
and that's exactly how these authors

1034
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
begin the paper with

1035
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,599
being able to robustly explore and

1036
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,440
navigate an environment has been a

1037
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
long-standing challenge in robotics so

1038
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,240
the paper just begins with

1039
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,320
what we've been talking about which is

1040
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
that this is like a perennial and a

1041
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,960
cross system problem but also in hashtag

1042
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
2022 it's far from solved in real world

1043
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,280
settings

1044
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,200
what else would you add

1045
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,359
i mean i especially like like the title

1046
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,800
of the paper which

1047
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,880
describes why we are doing all of this

1048
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
the title is are we ready for service

1049
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,680
robots and in the previous meme we saw

1050
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
that the third pillar the of the

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,640
trifecta after act and infer is so

1052
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,760
so all the robots that

1053
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
that we are building and most of the

1054
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,480
applications that we focus on are meant

1055
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,200
to serve that they have uh they have

1056
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,079
service as an objective function and

1057
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,040
that

1058
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,079
is what makes this task challenging

1059
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,640
because if you are replacing human

1060
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,480
actions by a robot um you

1061
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,800
have to forget all the assumptions we

1062
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,760
make when dealing with like human teams

1063
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,400
because human teams are dynamic and they

1064
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,720
uh learn on the fly and obviously they

1065
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,800
might be as they might not be as

1066
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,119
effective as a robot uh who might be

1067
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,240
better evolved to uh or better suited uh

1068
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,880
through its architecture to consider

1069
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,960
depth and different different kinds of

1070
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,680
attributes and a changing environment

1071
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,800
but

1072
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,839
that that group organization poses a lot

1073
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,839
of challenges to traditional slam

1074
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,160
techniques such as changing even one

1075
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,119
thing in that environment can um like

1076
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,319
greatly modify uh what map the robot had

1077
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,839
made and

1078
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,920
you can imagine this as like there's a

1079
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,720
map

1080
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,280
and you had localized your position with

1081
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,119
reference to particular objects in the

1082
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,319
map and then you move those objects so

1083
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,640
the robots world just shifted all around

1084
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,520
it literally and that

1085
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,839
that simple change might be very obvious

1086
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,599
for humans to detect

1087
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,160
but for a robot which is using those

1088
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,319
reference points to localize itself in

1089
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,000
the world and construct the map out of

1090
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
it that is a big challenge in

1091
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
traditional slam

1092
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,119
approaches so

1093
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,119
so yeah many people who have tried to

1094
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,280
train a robot before it cleans their

1095
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,720
house by

1096
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,160
like driving the robot around in

1097
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,359
different rooms

1098
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,040
is very familiar with this particular

1099
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,599
problem that when you move a chair

1100
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,160
in between the robot just completely

1101
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,480
forgets its entire sense of its

1102
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,240
surroundings so

1103
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,760
so yeah

1104
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,000
that's why i really like this reference

1105
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,640
yeah yes and that's gonna come into play

1106
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
with the internally maintained

1107
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,760
hierarchical generative model that the

1108
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,720
robot has on board and that may offer it

1109
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,240
some resilience against these kinds of

1110
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
changes so that's why we're going this

1111
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,960
route at all

1112
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,800
and one

1113
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,480
adjacent work that's discussed in the

1114
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,200
paper is rat slam

1115
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,960
so i will play the videos that if you

1116
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,200
want to maybe describe or contextualize

1117
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,280
rat slam

1118
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,480
yeah so rat slam was this

1119
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
bio-inspired technique which

1120
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,560
really solved

1121
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
such slam um in a very simple manner uh

1122
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,960
which is that you it it could do perform

1123
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,200
uh as effectively as other slam

1124
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,440
techniques which relied on um like

1125
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,920
expensive equipment and replaced it with

1126
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,680
like a simple camera which has in

1127
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,079
imperfect information so the video goes

1128
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,200
into it in a lot more detail and uh

1129
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
we'll cover it in the next slide as well

1130
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
uh but essentially it's a hippocampal

1131
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
model which means that it

1132
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,599
it models

1133
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,839
like a rat's brain and is able to

1134
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,240
like map the world and localize the

1135
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,640
robot that way so i think the video is

1136
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,960
very self-explanatory and the next video

1137
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,800
will explain it even more about how the

1138
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,599
map is constructed so yeah let's look at

1139
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
that one okay go for it

1140
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,800
so what is happening in this second

1141
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
video

1142
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,800
yeah so the second video is one instance

1143
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
of rad slam which is open rat slam so

1144
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,119
this was a code base that was released

1145
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,920
both for c plus plus as well as the ros

1146
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,400
operating the robot operating system and

1147
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,880
here you see um this one particular

1148
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
robot called the irat robot mapping out

1149
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,680
an australian environment which is an

1150
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,119
urban environment that you see on the

1151
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,680
top right and you see

1152
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
the robot making specific circles around

1153
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,319
certain loops and making

1154
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,560
both exploration decisions along the

1155
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,119
boundaries as well so this is very

1156
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,480
similar to how a rat um or a biological

1157
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
organism would explore a particular

1158
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,760
territory so all of this is being done

1159
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,000
with a single camera and that is the

1160
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,720
main um like achievement of this

1161
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,240
particular piece of work so

1162
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,079
through this paper you see that the

1163
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,119
inputs

1164
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,920
on the top right are mapped into

1165
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,720
the images that you see on the bottom

1166
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,599
right

1167
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
and those simple images are what's uh

1168
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,359
being used to map out the terrains so to

1169
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,599
the human eye that particular input is

1170
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,800
extremely blurry and not high fidelity

1171
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,440
enough to map out a terrain

1172
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,000
effectively but as this paper explores

1173
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,319
it can very effectively do that even

1174
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,400
when we degrade the image quality by a

1175
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,920
lot so that is um that is why rat slam

1176
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,960
became very popular as a sighted

1177
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,200
reference in this paper because it's one

1178
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,760
of those bioinspired techniques which

1179
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,839
comes very close to active inference

1180
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,880
techniques that this paper goes into

1181
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,119
so yeah that's what this video covers

1182
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,640
and it explores different kinds of

1183
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,400
terrains as you can see

1184
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
awesome

1185
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240
so the paper

1186
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
in the introduction

1187
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,839
introduces the relevance of this

1188
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,160
necessity of the deep navigational

1189
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,240
functions that humans and other

1190
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,880
organisms have but also that robots we

1191
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,040
would want to design having

1192
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,079
that's the main theme here

1193
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
if we learn from biology and bring

1194
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,000
action into

1195
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,640
robotic slam we may be able to

1196
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,160
have a way to approach these questions

1197
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
and then they say okay well how are we

1198
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,000
going to bring action into slam because

1199
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
this is sort of the inactivist insight

1200
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,960
that having the perfect map in one's

1201
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,599
head is like the knowing but then the

1202
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,400
knowing how to act is not always trivial

1203
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,880
even with the most high resolution map

1204
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,480
like one could know exactly every

1205
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,400
molecule of the car and still not know

1206
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,319
how it would fail in an environmental

1207
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,520
situation

1208
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
and that's what an activists and an

1209
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,319
activism gets at which is like what if

1210
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,000
somebody doesn't have the

1211
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,520
digital twin

1212
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,440
model of where things are on their body

1213
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,599
but actually the representation if there

1214
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,079
even is one is more about how the body

1215
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,560
should move or how one should act so

1216
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,720
that's called the pragmatic turn or the

1217
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,319
inactivist term

1218
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,319
and in the terms of cognitive science

1219
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,200
that's the 4e cognition so even though

1220
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
that is about the richness of usually

1221
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,760
human cognition embedded and cultured

1222
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,079
extended etc etc

1223
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,000
it's interesting to again see that come

1224
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,839
into play with this discussion of

1225
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,760
robotics like what if there are cultural

1226
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,480
practices around movement in a space how

1227
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,599
could that

1228
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,880
or be integrated into a robotics model

1229
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,800
so there's a lot um that goes with this

1230
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,359
taking serious of action selection

1231
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,160
as a real primary imperative not just

1232
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,880
the hypothetical mapping so

1233
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
they say well let's use active inference

1234
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
as a process theory of the brain that

1235
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,280
casts action as perception as two sides

1236
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,800
of the same coin not sure if it was

1237
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,119
action and perception but still maybe it

1238
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,240
stands both ways and a process theory is

1239
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,400
just like a way that it gets done

1240
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,920
so how do organisms get it done or

1241
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
taking one step removed in the

1242
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,559
instrumental direction how will we model

1243
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,880
organisms getting it done and then

1244
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,800
people can debate about what organisms

1245
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,520
actually do but this is like us

1246
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,720
actionably mapping that territory

1247
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,040
in section two they introduce some

1248
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
neural correlates of navigation which

1249
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,119
we're going to discuss in the next slide

1250
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,680
and in section 3 they bring the question

1251
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,319
of navigation in terms of active

1252
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,000
inference and so that's when they go

1253
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
from this hierarchical bayesian

1254
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,760
generative model of localization

1255
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,599
and on one hand connected to the active

1256
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,839
inference framework and on the other to

1257
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,400
this prior work on machine learning in

1258
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,960
robotics

1259
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,640
and that was also related to their

1260
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,960
previous paper so the others of course

1261
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,720
have previous work and there's related

1262
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,200
work too

1263
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,280
okay

1264
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,079
so

1265
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,800
uh the h slash e oh do you have anything

1266
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,400
others said i mean

1267
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,280
yeah in the introduction they raised two

1268
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,839
very important points before

1269
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,520
they start to go into the actual

1270
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,440
techniques they have implemented so they

1271
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,480
say that humans um easily explore and

1272
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,160
map their surroundings without much

1273
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,640
extra thought or considerations like

1274
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,400
intuitively we build a logically

1275
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,640
consistent map without needing accurate

1276
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,720
distance measurements and we find it

1277
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,800
natural to think about navigation in

1278
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,960
terms of sequences of moves towards

1279
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,520
locations and when we are considering

1280
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
moving to that new location humans

1281
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,440
typically do not consider lower level

1282
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,520
tasks such as opening doors or lifting

1283
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,400
feet

1284
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,480
in this paper they go into

1285
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,440
like lower level tasks as well because

1286
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,960
those kinds of assumptions cannot be

1287
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,920
made

1288
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,880
for robots and they also mention an

1289
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,319
interesting point which is that the

1290
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,800
working of the human mapping and

1291
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
localization hasn't been thoroughly

1292
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,079
understood

1293
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:38,880
but

1294
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,280
the best models we have so far are

1295
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,839
present for rodent navigation which is

1296
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,319
where rat slam and other techniques come

1297
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,079
come from so

1298
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,280
this um like predicates the work that

1299
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,760
goes on into this paper and how they

1300
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,000
model this as a multi-agent active

1301
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,359
inference

1302
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,960
task

1303
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,760
great

1304
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,319
so the h slash e system

1305
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,800
is the hippocampal slash enter rhino

1306
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,760
system

1307
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,240
and homologous brain regions are here

1308
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,119
shown for the mouse the rodent the

1309
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,839
macaque which is a type of primate and

1310
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,119
the human

1311
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,520
and these brains are sort of aligned

1312
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,520
and shown so that one can see how these

1313
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,680
regions are evolutionarily related to

1314
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,800
one another

1315
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,599
and then on the bottom are some examples

1316
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,240
of histology or tissue stainings showing

1317
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,000
like kind of a cross section and a

1318
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,520
little bit more detail at the cellular

1319
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
level because as one might imagine this

1320
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,640
has been studied and there's many many

1321
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
copious numbers of like review papers

1322
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,520
and so it's like a whole thing

1323
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,599
how people have studied this like many

1324
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,119
others but

1325
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,839
here is a citation that they provided

1326
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,000
in the paper i believe

1327
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,960
which was a buzaki paper

1328
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,119
about memory navigation and the theta

1329
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,280
rhythm in the hippocampal and torino

1330
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,400
system so suffice to say that the

1331
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,240
function of this

1332
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,319
coupling of brain regions has been

1333
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,119
modeled in some very fascinating and

1334
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,480
rich ways

1335
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,040
and trying to understand how the same

1336
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,480
brain regions

1337
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
in different functional

1338
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,119
ways

1339
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,079
can

1340
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,200
be

1341
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,440
integrating different aspects of

1342
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,160
selfness and memory navigation

1343
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,480
wayfinding some of the complexities of

1344
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,920
how these different functions are

1345
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,880
related to each other

1346
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,319
anything to add on that and then we'll

1347
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,680
look at how that has been addressed in

1348
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,640
the active inference framework

1349
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,680
yeah

1350
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,000
the only thing i would add is one

1351
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,480
particular image that i'll paste in this

1352
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,040
particular slide which is

1353
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,520
like look at the similarity between the

1354
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,079
tasks done by the hippocampus and the

1355
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,599
intro rhino system and the similar setup

1356
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,280
sensors on this particular robot so

1357
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,240
we use extremely

1358
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
similar architectures to center

1359
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,640
ourselves in the world which is we use

1360
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,559
sensors in the form of sensory organs

1361
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,440
and

1362
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,000
obviously ears and eyes and all these

1363
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,240
are sensors but all of that is computed

1364
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,839
in that particular

1365
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,400
region of the brain which is considered

1366
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,559
the robot localization module in this

1367
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,960
particular robot so

1368
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,839
so yeah that's what that analogy i find

1369
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,359
interesting

1370
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,680
awesome and that's with the action

1371
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,200
states in the sense states like just

1372
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,280
like the sensors and actuators we could

1373
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,839
have two of the same kind or 50 of the

1374
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,520
same kind or 50 different kinds and

1375
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
that's like the kind of multi-sensor

1376
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,559
fusion that's also interesting to think

1377
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,520
about

1378
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,240
and

1379
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
they write in the paper we will ground

1380
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,920
the following discussion of the

1381
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,480
hippocampal enter rhino system in terms

1382
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,319
of its role in generalized search and

1383
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,559
navigation and the citation here is to

1384
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,880
this kaplan and frist and paper we're

1385
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,280
not going to go over this model right

1386
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,920
now but people could pause look at the

1387
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,079
graphical model go to the citation and

1388
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,520
we'll hear about it more from the

1389
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,280
authors how did they build on prior work

1390
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,079
all

1391
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,920
i'll add here unless i said if you want

1392
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,160
to ask them who's totally chill would be

1393
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,960
um

1394
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,920
they use a bayesian graphical framework

1395
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,520
and we're going to see a lot of bayesian

1396
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,200
graphical frameworks

1397
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,480
the nodes the circles represent

1398
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,480
statistical variables

1399
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,000
of different kinds

1400
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,119
and then the edges reflect the sparsity

1401
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,119
of influence of connections amongst

1402
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,440
those variables so like two variables

1403
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,599
that influence each other have arrows

1404
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,359
pointing between each other and this is

1405
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,920
a bayesian graph way that is sometimes

1406
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,400
used to represent models graphically

1407
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,000
that's kind of playing on graphical in

1408
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
two senses like it's visual it's

1409
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,040
graphical like a picture but also it's a

1410
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,119
graph like a network so it's something

1411
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,280
that is a representation of models at

1412
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,760
the intersection of those two senses of

1413
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,680
graphical and we use them a lot in

1414
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,079
active inference and in this paper they

1415
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,280
made active inference models for

1416
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,920
navigation and search and they overlaid

1417
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,680
it on some of the plausible neural

1418
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,760
anatomy of the brain and some of the

1419
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,280
functions that those regions of the

1420
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,440
brain have been modeled or seen as

1421
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,920
performing

1422
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,640
great

1423
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,520
okay yeah

1424
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,960
the

1425
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,760
uh

1426
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,280
paper also on the biological section

1427
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
explores the grid cells and we saw the

1428
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,520
grid cells also in rat slam

1429
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,920
the grid cells are in the enter rhino

1430
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,040
cortex so it's in the he system

1431
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,520
and they represent a largely triangular

1432
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,920
or hexagonal tiling of space organized

1433
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,559
according to egocentric reference frames

1434
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,799
now it's hexagonal in the flat plane but

1435
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,680
what shape is it in higher dimensions

1436
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,599
and they write that the regularity of

1437
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,839
these repeating grids provides a basis

1438
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,079
for path integration via estimating

1439
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,319
distances and location in terms of the

1440
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,319
direction and frequency with which this

1441
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,680
metric grid metric tiling is traversed

1442
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,480
and

1443
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,040
this was pretty interesting to hear how

1444
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,359
they framed it in physical domains it

1445
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,960
has been observed that the spacing of

1446
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,640
grading representations varies as a

1447
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,799
function of the space being tiled each

1448
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,160
is smaller

1449
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,920
and more fine-grained if an agent is

1450
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,000
situated within an enclosure or larger

1451
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,200
and more coarse grained if it is

1452
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,599
situated in an open space

1453
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,440
the granularity of tilings appears to be

1454
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,359
influenced by brain stem locomotor

1455
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,359
nuclei potentially reflecting an

1456
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,200
inductive bias for greater speed being

1457
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,280
more likely in larger spaces

1458
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,480
as well as by

1459
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,559
exteroceptive stimulus such as optic

1460
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,440
flow

1461
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,000
so it makes me think about driving at 70

1462
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,240
miles per hour and it's like

1463
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,280
one still has this extended sense

1464
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
of mobility and well i could make a left

1465
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,599
turn over that space and time scale and

1466
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,440
that's as natural feeling to somebody

1467
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,200
who's familiar with driving in a certain

1468
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,359
context as like i'm running at this

1469
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,960
speed and i can make a certain turn at a

1470
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,440
certain speed and then the optic flow

1471
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,680
reminds me of a great experiment with

1472
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,319
honeybees where they had them forage but

1473
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,000
they had to go in and out through this

1474
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,240
long section where there was an

1475
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
alternating stripe pattern and so when

1476
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,799
the stripes were thick like let's just

1477
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
say a meter of dark and then a meter of

1478
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
light then they would forage a certain

1479
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,240
distance and they would be able to do

1480
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,480
the waggle dance and communicate it to

1481
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,559
their nest mates but then when that was

1482
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,880
replaced with a very fast alternating

1483
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,280
stripes it increased what's known as

1484
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,839
optic flow which is just the simple rate

1485
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,400
of change like the frame differencing

1486
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,079
across the retina and the b's were

1487
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,960
foraging a shorter distance

1488
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,640
because it was like

1489
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,040
their estimates of optic flow were

1490
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,119
higher and i think that speaks to also a

1491
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,799
point that stephen has raised in the

1492
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,160
chat which is the information geometry

1493
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,319
versus information geography

1494
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,240
and that could be connected to a lot of

1495
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,240
different other areas so that's just

1496
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,079
something to think about with how's the

1497
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,240
actual space represented how's the

1498
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
perceptual space represented and the

1499
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,319
grid cells are something that people

1500
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,920
have modeled as

1501
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,839
being at the intersection there from a

1502
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,680
cognitive perspective and from a tissue

1503
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,680
perspective

1504
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,880
anything to add

1505
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,160
yeah so

1506
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,240
yeah stephen has raised a great point

1507
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,400
above the geography and i think in

1508
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,720
humans and organisms

1509
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,200
like ants and bees it's more about

1510
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,880
survival and that is why they um

1511
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,359
like attach a different kind of a grid

1512
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,520
sizing for different kinds of terrains

1513
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,839
and yeah your description of driving in

1514
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,280
an open wide road is extremely accurate

1515
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,920
and so is the bees one and i think it

1516
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,079
comes down to minimizing

1517
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,000
error or

1518
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,160
like being more specific um in

1519
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,200
constrained environments um so

1520
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,599
so if their actions um are as

1521
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,359
wide and as

1522
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,640
um

1523
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,920
like

1524
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,680
broad ranging as

1525
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,480
an open environment that might uh

1526
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
like be harmful for their objective

1527
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,040
function which is not only

1528
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,280
like reaching from point a to point b in

1529
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,079
that

1530
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,040
small environment but also like survival

1531
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
like just banging into

1532
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,440
an obstacle if they are not being very

1533
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,200
specific about their grid size so

1534
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,520
so i think yeah it comes down to optical

1535
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,480
optic flow as well as um i think these

1536
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
survival functions which are like hidden

1537
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,880
states um in like the models of all

1538
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,960
these agents

1539
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,400
awesome

1540
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,280
um

1541
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,720
they

1542
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,359
move from the biological

1543
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,119
towards the formal

1544
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,240
by

1545
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,920
writing speculatively

1546
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,079
if hippocampal pattern completion is

1547
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,119
inherently predictive or generative in a

1548
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,480
bayesian framework

1549
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,240
then this could help to scaffold the

1550
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,920
development of more sophisticated

1551
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
predictive abilities for the rest of the

1552
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,079
brain so i think this is a very deep

1553
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,079
area that'll be fun to explore in the

1554
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,400
conversations but it's almost like you

1555
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,799
can bootstrap more complexity off of

1556
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,359
something that is already providing

1557
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,880
a more complex and oscillating signal

1558
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,640
so i think the richness of self and the

1559
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,799
placed basedness

1560
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,119
and learnability there is quite

1561
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,040
interesting to explore

1562
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,960
and they also

1563
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,720
uh note that there's ample evidence that

1564
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,319
spatial awareness is at the core of the

1565
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,839
mammal brain with explicit

1566
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,680
representation for pose heading in

1567
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,720
location

1568
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,640
so what

1569
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,000
i wanted to explore here in the

1570
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,839
discussions was

1571
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,920
location is the core of the mammal brain

1572
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,720
or cognitive functions in general or in

1573
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,400
insects too or something no it's

1574
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,680
olfaction no it's emotion no it's this

1575
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,559
so where do some of these core

1576
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,079
functions fit

1577
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,079
and then they close the section by just

1578
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,599
writing

1579
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,319
uh

1580
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,520
taking it from the introduction with the

1581
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,920
robotics to the biological in section

1582
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,520
two and then they say in the remainder

1583
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,280
of this paper we will further build on

1584
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,119
these insights using a process theory of

1585
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,960
the brain deeply rooted in predictive

1586
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,280
processing active inference so you'll

1587
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,520
note that other than our additional

1588
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,960
context like we haven't gotten into

1589
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,440
active in the paper but that's when they

1590
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,920
cross the rubicon and from here on out

1591
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,440
we're going to be talking about the

1592
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,359
active inference formalization

1593
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,880
anything else to acid

1594
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,559
yeah

1595
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,119
i mean i really like how you framed

1596
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,520
that particular importance that um

1597
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,240
different kinds of organisms and

1598
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,960
like robots have to be assigned

1599
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,599
when when we are dealing with

1600
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,640
like their objective functions which is

1601
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,559
is location um

1602
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,240
like the most important state for them

1603
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,040
or

1604
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,640
um are other senses more important and

1605
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
if we are thinking about like

1606
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,880
self-driving cars and uh like evidently

1607
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,799
like tesla is very particular on not

1608
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,040
using lidar and

1609
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,240
like laser depth sensing technologies it

1610
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,359
it's trying to just use rgb depth

1611
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,839
cameras and trying to navigate

1612
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,680
the world and i think the same is true

1613
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,960
for

1614
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,559
comma which is

1615
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,440
another open source self-driving toolkit

1616
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,319
so these kinds of toolkits that exist

1617
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,720
for navigation in the physical world

1618
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,079
they

1619
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,280
just rely on location and

1620
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,839
like vision as their only source of

1621
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,000
input and not other senses

1622
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,720
so

1623
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,640
so yeah it's interesting how you can

1624
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,200
modify the importance of these different

1625
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,440
attributes to achieve different tasks

1626
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,480
all right

1627
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,319
so into section three

1628
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,559
navigation as hierarchical active

1629
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,359
inference okay so this is where

1630
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,680
active inference gets applied in the

1631
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,760
theory level and then it gets applied in

1632
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,799
another way when it becomes simulated

1633
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,319
and then in another way when it becomes

1634
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,799
enacted etcetera so we cast the slam

1635
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,400
problem in terms of a hierarchical

1636
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,480
bayesian generative model

1637
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,960
the agent reasons on two different

1638
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,559
nested levels

1639
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,079
so there's going to be the use of a

1640
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,000
higher and lower to describe these two

1641
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,359
different ones but one could use

1642
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,960
different spatial metaphors like inner

1643
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,559
or outer or

1644
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,039
however else on a higher level but this

1645
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,079
is going to be consistent with the

1646
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,640
coloring and which one is placed above

1647
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,599
or below

1648
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,440
on a higher level for long-term

1649
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,680
navigation and on a lower level for

1650
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,520
short-term perception

1651
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,440
on the higher level the agent is capable

1652
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,119
of reasoning in terms of sequences of

1653
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,280
location it wants to visit i want to go

1654
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,200
to the post office and then to the

1655
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
university and then back home

1656
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,880
without having to worry about the

1657
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,480
intricacies of how to control its

1658
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,240
actuators to get there like i'm not

1659
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,799
overthinking the footsteps and how to

1660
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,319
cross the street

1661
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,319
on the lower level the agent can reason

1662
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,160
and plan in terms of observation

1663
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
sequences without needing to think too

1664
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,280
far ahead

1665
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,520
short term action selection plans based

1666
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,359
upon ongoing

1667
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,559
input

1668
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,240
we will distinguish between the higher

1669
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,400
level and the lower level actuation by

1670
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,920
calling them moves m and actions a for

1671
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,240
the two higher and lower levels

1672
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,240
and the sensor readings like the visual

1673
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,240
input but other sensors could be added

1674
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,839
to at the lower level are called

1675
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,440
observations and that's modeled with an

1676
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,400
o

1677
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,559
and that reminded me of the relationship

1678
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,240
between strategy and tactics in chess

1679
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,200
whereas

1680
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,520
in strategy there are more heuristics

1681
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,160
like control the center or

1682
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,400
the knight on the rim is grim because it

1683
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,559
has reduced mobility that doesn't

1684
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,079
actually suggest

1685
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,640
how to do it or what kind of a direct or

1686
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,280
oblique strategy would actually be

1687
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,720
realized in which way it's just sort of

1688
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,960
like general ideas and then there's the

1689
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,680
tactical and the rollout and all of that

1690
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,160
in the in the specifics of the situation

1691
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,480
which cannot be really thought too far

1692
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,079
in advance because even just two or

1693
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,039
three in advance the branching is so

1694
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,559
complex

1695
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,440
that

1696
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,079
it's not really useful all the time

1697
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,599
although some brute force approaches

1698
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,839
have used that to great success and it

1699
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,920
may work in certain cases but it's not a

1700
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,760
general strategy just to roll out

1701
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,599
tactics further and further and then

1702
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,520
hope that strategy just falls out of

1703
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,160
rollouts of tactics so

1704
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,839
i'm sure you'll have some thought on

1705
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,440
that but how do you think that frames

1706
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,440
this as a multi-scale statistical

1707
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,880
problem and then it's going to be

1708
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
approached from this bayesian active

1709
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,559
inference way

1710
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,039
yeah i think it perfectly models it so

1711
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,359
you added strategy and tactics i would

1712
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,400
only add objective objectives um like as

1713
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,880
the third element to that so objectives

1714
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,599
strategy and tactics are like these

1715
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
different levels of tasks that people

1716
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,480
want to achieve and this is not only

1717
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,599
true for uh the tasks that uh that you

1718
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,480
refer to like chess or um other

1719
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,520
applications but also like when we go

1720
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,240
about in our own life like our

1721
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,559
higher level task can not just be going

1722
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,240
to the post office but

1723
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,480
achieving some objective as a result of

1724
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,920
that which is

1725
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,240
i i'm going to the post office because i

1726
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
might have received an admission letter

1727
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,440
from uh from a university and that has a

1728
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,000
higher level task on top of it which is

1729
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,720
uh this has broader implications to my

1730
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,520
career or life in general so one

1731
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,680
person's or one robot strategy can be

1732
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,000
another robot's tactics it's and the way

1733
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,440
you define moves and actions is totally

1734
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,799
arbitrary and dependent on like how

1735
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,599
reliable your sensors are so

1736
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,480
i think

1737
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,000
the levels are

1738
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,920
the place where we draw the line between

1739
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,880
lower higher or inner and outer levels

1740
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,079
are

1741
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,000
dependent on the sensors which is the

1742
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,680
ground truth that we can reliably

1743
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,680
measure in that particular movement

1744
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,119
the only thing i'll add there is that

1745
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,359
also just like you said where one robot

1746
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,119
strategies and others tactics this

1747
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,680
nesting of bayesian generative models

1748
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,359
can be

1749
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,680
three layers it can be four layers etc

1750
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,359
so there's arbitrary design of these

1751
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,200
graphs and we've seen like in

1752
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,359
metacognitive papers like active

1753
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,559
livestream number 25 on metacognition as

1754
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,359
mental action it actually is like action

1755
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,039
and perception all the way up all the

1756
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,280
way down so just because a layer isn't

1757
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,520
modeled we have an interface for the

1758
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,760
unknown through

1759
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,720
the blankets that we do specify

1760
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,520
okay

1761
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,200
so let's look at it specifically all

1762
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,839
right on the left is figure one it is

1763
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,319
the prototypical generative model of an

1764
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,720
active inference agent as we discussed a

1765
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,640
little before the nodes in the graphical

1766
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,960
model represent random variables

1767
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
where the gray color is indicating the

1768
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,839
observed variables so the observations

1769
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,200
are observed

1770
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,240
in gray

1771
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,559
and then the actions are also observed

1772
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,039
so one could complicate this assumption

1773
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,400
but we're assuming that like if the

1774
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,960
robot is hitting the gas that it knows

1775
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,520
that it's actually doing that motion

1776
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,359
an observation at the current time step

1777
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,000
o sub t is generated by the hidden state

1778
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,160
s so it has the white node so it is a

1779
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,599
not directly observed but it's like a

1780
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,359
parameter in a model

1781
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,559
the generative model of the robot

1782
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,160
which in turn is generated by the

1783
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,480
previous hidden state and action at time

1784
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,039
steps t minus one so it's like here's s

1785
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,760
in the past and it's marching forward

1786
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,440
and then it's influenced by its prior

1787
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,599
states as well as by how actions

1788
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,920
influence states if at all

1789
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,839
and future states and observations

1790
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,359
depend on future actions which are

1791
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,839
determined or not completely determined

1792
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,359
but that's but have a statistical

1793
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,760
relationship with the policy pi

1794
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,839
and policy pi

1795
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:34,640
is

1796
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,440
sequences of actions if one has a policy

1797
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,760
depth of one then the action at the next

1798
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,440
time step in the policy are the same

1799
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,839
inference but when we have a horizon of

1800
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,480
planning that's deeper than one

1801
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,839
it means that policies are actually

1802
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,280
sequences of action and that's part of

1803
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,240
the complexity of cybernetics and so on

1804
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,280
and on the right i have a little bit cut

1805
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,000
this generative model into a grid so the

1806
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,200
now time step is the action that we took

1807
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,319
in the past

1808
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,400
the hidden state inference at that time

1809
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,440
unobserved and the real time observation

1810
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,559
and then

1811
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,520
the

1812
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,000
left to right is the past

1813
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,160
time step the now time step the next

1814
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,238
time step and then just deep future time

1815
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,479
steps whatever the horizon of planning

1816
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:19,198
is

1817
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,960
and this is a discrete time model

1818
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,359
there's also continuous time active

1819
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,040
active inference models and they can be

1820
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,679
used together but it's not in this paper

1821
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,080
and at the top is policy selection and

1822
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,679
there's a lot of cognitive apparatus

1823
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,198
that might connect to this pie but

1824
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,000
that's also not modeled here

1825
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,719
action selection is these a's

1826
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,560
and those are just your actions through

1827
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,238
time i moved e2 e4 and then nf3

1828
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,479
and then the hidden states are whatever

1829
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,000
the hidden states are that are being

1830
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,479
tracked as being influenced or related

1831
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,600
to policy selections via action and then

1832
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,359
hidden states embed observations and

1833
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,040
that's what makes it a partially

1834
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,319
observed markov process and then because

1835
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,380
it's a

1836
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,560
[Music]

1837
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,960
policy variable that's being modeled

1838
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,359
here it's a partially observed markov

1839
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,679
decision process because it's not just

1840
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,080
the markup process inference it's also

1841
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,238
having action as a parameter that's

1842
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,120
planning as inference

1843
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,839
anything to add on

1844
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,238
one yeah i think adding the grid really

1845
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,359
helps

1846
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,399
simplify the different steps that

1847
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,920
the agent has to

1848
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,560
take and how it's composable with

1849
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,399
different policies that might connect

1850
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,158
from different objectives so

1851
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,238
so yeah the observed and

1852
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,319
unobserved are i think the more

1853
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,520
important key pieces here which is uh

1854
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,319
which again can be

1855
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,759
have like which can have different

1856
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,158
probabilities because um

1857
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,600
as you go

1858
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,198
through deeper layers

1859
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,920
you can consider the previous layers

1860
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,920
observation um previous layers

1861
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,760
unobserved state to be your current

1862
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,000
layer's observed state so it depends on

1863
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,520
how much

1864
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,000
like probability you assign to

1865
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,760
like the strength of that particular

1866
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,159
observation and

1867
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,400
yeah

1868
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,080
one last thing which is the observations

1869
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,480
in the future are unobserved so just to

1870
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,600
note that there's a difference between

1871
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,880
the past and the future and one could

1872
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,080
also imagine that maybe there's a

1873
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
forgetting or something like that but

1874
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,679
that's a very key difference is that the

1875
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,080
same type of variable like actions are

1876
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,920
unobserved in the future we can't say

1877
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,520
well we'll make these three moves it's

1878
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,120
like but what if another chess piece

1879
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,719
blocks that specific move well that

1880
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,080
would be dumb of them to do but would it

1881
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,000
so that's part of the complexity of

1882
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,920
strategy so

1883
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,400
figure two is where they go from this

1884
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,120
single layer model this is kind of the

1885
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,800
kernel of the model

1886
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,400
and they're going to

1887
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,880
introduce a slightly more complicated

1888
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,719
graphical model this is going to

1889
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,960
specifically cast navigation as a

1890
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,360
hierarchical generative model for active

1891
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,320
inference and so the lower level is this

1892
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,440
again more tactical more local visual

1893
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,120
perception on the bottom

1894
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,719
filled in observations that's the

1895
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,400
real-time camera data

1896
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,080
coming in

1897
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,840
is one way to think about it but another

1898
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,120
way to think about it is actually by

1899
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,880
looking at the arrow direction it's

1900
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,960
being generated

1901
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,280
using some underlying states

1902
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,600
and then the actions at that lower level

1903
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,480
are also being observed in the past

1904
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,800
and at the lower level highlight in blue

1905
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,159
the model is entertaining beliefs about

1906
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,600
hidden states s

1907
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,000
that agents and the agents pose p so

1908
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,920
here's the s and the p like each time

1909
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,640
step there's a hidden state

1910
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,480
and the pose

1911
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,159
the hidden states are giving rise to the

1912
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,080
observations o

1913
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,239
and then the hidden state and pose are

1914
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,480
influenced by the previous state

1915
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,880
that's the arrow coming horizontally

1916
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,760
pose

1917
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,600
and action or the higher level model in

1918
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,360
the case of the initial states and so

1919
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,199
here is like at each

1920
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,040
time step so here we're like in this

1921
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,040
blue block with a t

1922
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,320
um

1923
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,920
[Music]

1924
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,480
like at the faster model

1925
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,920
time step

1926
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,520
and then at the slower level there's an

1927
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,400
injection

1928
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,560
from this like slower click that shoots

1929
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,199
something in and then that in influences

1930
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,120
the rest of this blue block

1931
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,400
and then it's carried forward and

1932
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,000
there's another injection like a slower

1933
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,280
time scale at that more strategic

1934
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,719
level

1935
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,719
and at the higher level highlighted red

1936
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,520
the agent reasons about locations

1937
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,280
the next location is determined by

1938
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,080
executing the move on m so here's the

1939
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,320
more slower updating movements like

1940
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,040
where one is in that map and then this

1941
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,560
is the

1942
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,960
more fine-grained action selection

1943
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,480
what what do you see in this figure

1944
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,840
yeah so um

1945
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,080
yeah it uh like it's a continuation of

1946
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,120
the previous uh figure and um like the

1947
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,280
speed differences are what's interesting

1948
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,080
here like uh the higher level being just

1949
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,040
a two-step process whereas the lower

1950
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,840
figure has more involved actions

1951
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,880
involved

1952
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,760
so

1953
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,760
so yeah you see that observations exist

1954
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,560
in both these layers but

1955
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,760
there's more

1956
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,400
depth of unobserved states in that

1957
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,599
particular lower layer

1958
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,320
i hope that now by

1959
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,000
filling in some formalisms related to

1960
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,120
this

1961
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,960
that we can put a little detail because

1962
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,080
there's a lot that could be said about

1963
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,880
this and i hope that we've been at least

1964
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
consistent in our descriptions but we'll

1965
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,000
look forward to

1966
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,800
hearing from the authors on it so

1967
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,060
um

1968
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,719
[Music]

1969
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,400
they write in active inference the agent

1970
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,920
will infer beliefs over these hidden

1971
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,640
states based upon experience

1972
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,960
looking back into the past observations

1973
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,800
those are the observations from the past

1974
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,040
that the computer has access to as well

1975
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,560
as infer future actions through a

1976
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,400
process of minimizing variational free

1977
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,560
energy this is where they're going to

1978
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,280
introduce this free energy minimization

1979
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,840
as kind of like a model metric that

1980
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,880
helps do

1981
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,040
parameter selection parameter

1982
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,400
optimization on this type of graph so we

1983
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,480
have some graphical structure believe it

1984
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,239
or not and it could look different that

1985
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,480
does strategy and tactics it's like the

1986
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,640
skeleton but then the real challenge is

1987
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,360
to have the video data come in and to

1988
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,280
have the movement data actually modeled

1989
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,199
and to make that happen on limited

1990
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,440
hardware and so on

1991
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,239
and so what they do is first describe

1992
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,320
that in terms of equations and then

1993
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,920
they're going to talk a little bit later

1994
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,000
about like how the equations get adapted

1995
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,840
into using neural networks and actual

1996
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
cameras and sensors but this is just

1997
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
going to be still at the equation level

1998
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,159
going from this graphical intuition

1999
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,239
about how to do strategy and tactics and

2000
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,560
how to have them modify each other into

2001
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,280
an analytical um way of framing it

2002
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,159
so

2003
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,120
p

2004
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,520
is the joint model of

2005
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,400
o s a pi that's the observations the

2006
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,960
video camera data that states

2007
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,560
hidden states at this

2008
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,080
layer

2009
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,400
and the actions

2010
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,159
and the policy

2011
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,320
different aspects of the past present

2012
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,560
and future are modeled as sparsely

2013
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,480
connected so one could believe it or not

2014
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,560
that those are sparsely connected so

2015
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,199
called in reality but in this model

2016
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,640
there's actually quite sparse

2017
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,640
connectivity amongst variables even

2018
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,480
though if

2019
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,400
um if it's new to you it might look like

2020
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,880
a circuit board or something but

2021
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,719
relationship to the all versus all that

2022
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,320
it could be connected

2023
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,480
this is a quite sparse connectivity like

2024
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,320
this bottom left one doesn't influence

2025
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,760
this top right one for example so

2026
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,760
factorization is a way that that

2027
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,159
sparsity of the variables can be

2028
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,040
converted into a factorized equation so

2029
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,800
we have this joint distribution which is

2030
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,840
like the ultimate panopticon

2031
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,679
distribution but because their sparsity

2032
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,000
of connectivity different parts of the

2033
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,080
model can be like partitioned out

2034
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,320
differently so it's like this big joint

2035
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,679
model that gets separated into separate

2036
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,679
parts and each of those one can

2037
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,440
interpret as being like the distribution

2038
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,560
of that

2039
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,400
so like there's the distribution of

2040
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,880
policies the district over two policies

2041
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,960
or over continuous policies then there's

2042
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,880
the distribution of action states that

2043
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,679
are taken depending on the policy so

2044
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,679
like given that i intended to move a and

2045
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,040
then b

2046
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,040
did i actually take a

2047
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,480
then there's the state underlying

2048
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,280
distribution in green hidden state so

2049
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,440
that's not directly observed the blue is

2050
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,360
the distribution of observations

2051
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,440
conditioned on hidden states that's like

2052
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,800
a bayesian hidden markov model and then

2053
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,360
there's this relatively more complex and

2054
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,320
combinatoric term that is asking well

2055
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,159
how do states

2056
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,159
depend on past states and actions

2057
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,960
and then how do actions actually depend

2058
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,199
on policy decisions

2059
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,679
and how do the observations in the

2060
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,679
future depend on the hidden states in

2061
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,360
the future

2062
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,280
so it's taking this joint model and

2063
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,719
breaking it down into a few different

2064
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,719
pieces that as we'll see can be

2065
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,239
simplified

2066
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,480
and that makes this problem tractable in

2067
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,239
a way that just the all by all

2068
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,679
non-factorized non-factorizable model is

2069
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,880
much more difficult to fit

2070
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,640
yeah okay absolutely and yeah this this

2071
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,640
goes into like the practical

2072
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,280
um implementation of how such a thing

2073
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,000
can be done and the interesting uh

2074
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,159
factor in this formula for me is like

2075
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,480
the combinatoric term which takes in the

2076
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,360
previous states and um like multiplies

2077
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,640
it with the current state um and

2078
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,719
like this is one of

2079
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,360
the ways active inference can be modeled

2080
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,239
and i think in previous live streams uh

2081
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,679
like there might be different

2082
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,600
implementations of the same framework

2083
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,320
where os a and pi are used in many

2084
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,640
different um like formulae and

2085
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,199
arrangements

2086
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,040
great point yes

2087
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,560
though there are some differences in

2088
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,440
notation across papers

2089
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,640
there is hopefully um more coherence

2090
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
than not so knowing this framework helps

2091
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,199
one understand active inference domain

2092
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,440
different domain models okay

2093
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,719
so

2094
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,840
how is free energy going to be used to

2095
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,760
fit this model

2096
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,760
both on the sort of perception as

2097
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,080
inference side so that's the part of the

2098
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,880
model on the bottom that's more like a

2099
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,960
what is my pose given the visual input

2100
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,480
and what action should i take in the

2101
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,760
short term

2102
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,120
and this deeper more navigational

2103
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,000
layer

2104
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,400
at in the red how are those going to be

2105
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,560
reconciled and parameterized which

2106
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,239
includes action selection and policy

2107
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:45,520
selection how's that going to be

2108
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,520
parameterized using a single criterion

2109
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,520
so they use the variational free energy

2110
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,040
and it's calculated up to the current

2111
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,080
step t so variational free energy

2112
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,239
as contrasted which we'll get to with

2113
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,239
expected free energy variational free

2114
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,840
energy is like the parts that are

2115
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,719
observable are easier to calculate over

2116
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,000
one can imagine so that's the

2117
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,159
variational free energy and the expected

2118
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,840
free energy is going to have continuity

2119
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,760
with the variational free energy but

2120
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,920
it's going to introduce this

2121
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,560
complexity of calculating expected free

2122
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,199
energies about unobserved observations

2123
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,280
and actions but they're similar but it

2124
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,880
goes like from first variational free

2125
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,719
energy is looking back and that's the

2126
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,040
more perceptual component and then

2127
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,360
there's a deeper expected component once

2128
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,199
a time horizon is considered

2129
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,400
so

2130
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,520
we can go into this more with the

2131
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,400
authors but briefly in the first line f

2132
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,719
this variational free energy is being

2133
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,960
defined as the expectation that's the

2134
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,159
fancy e

2135
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,840
of the difference

2136
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,320
between

2137
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,320
the q distribution which is the

2138
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,080
variational distribution that's under

2139
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,560
the control of the experimenter of the

2140
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,400
robot and that's like a simplified

2141
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,640
distribution family so just like fitting

2142
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,880
a linear model can be done even if the

2143
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,320
data are super non-linear and you're

2144
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,719
totally misled fitting a linear model

2145
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,960
can be quite fast or fitting just a

2146
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,000
parabolic model can be quite fast so if

2147
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,920
you constrain what model family you're

2148
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,639
willing to use for q

2149
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:13,679
though there are still some quite

2150
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,159
expressive families that are also

2151
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,400
tractable then you can try to minimize

2152
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,000
the expectation of the difference

2153
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,199
between the distribution that you're

2154
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,760
controlling and this distribution that

2155
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,520
you'd like to know that's going to help

2156
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,760
you go a long way towards doing policy

2157
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,440
selection

2158
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,719
this expectation can be rewritten using

2159
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,000
a kl divergence

2160
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,080
and that can also be rephrased as a

2161
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,679
difference between

2162
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,520
a kl divergence and another expectation

2163
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,440
we can go more into this with authors

2164
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,719
and i think that will be great to hear

2165
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,320
their explanation but for now just want

2166
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,599
to leave it at that level of detail

2167
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,400
yeah i agree and

2168
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,400
i mean the broader point that i

2169
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,880
see from this particular framing is

2170
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,040
like representing it in terms of

2171
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,920
divergence and evidence and this is how

2172
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,440
not only they use it for their

2173
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,920
experimental setting but this is how the

2174
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,600
actual free energy model will be

2175
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,480
implemented in a real life situation as

2176
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:16,000
well in which uh the first term which is

2177
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,040
in their control um may not be um like

2178
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,280
in their control when the robot is in a

2179
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,040
dynamic environment

2180
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,560
like that so

2181
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,400
in this particular paper in a warehouse

2182
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,480
environment this kind of a framing makes

2183
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,639
perfect sense um but

2184
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,040
when the setting might be different the

2185
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,400
framing might also need to reflect that

2186
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,000
nice and and also there's that

2187
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,400
complexity minus accuracy interpretation

2188
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,280
yeah

2189
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,040
okay so

2190
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,560
here's where they move from the

2191
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,880
variational free energy f to the

2192
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,800
expected free energy g so they write

2193
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,560
crucially in active inference the agent

2194
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,159
will not only optimize its generative

2195
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,840
model by minimizing f for past

2196
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,120
observations in addition the agent will

2197
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,719
also select actions that it believes

2198
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,719
will minimize its future surprise

2199
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,400
however future observations are not yet

2200
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,639
available the free energy f cannot be

2201
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,280
computed and the expected free energy g

2202
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,199
is used instead to compare the effect of

2203
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,280
various policies or actions in relation

2204
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,040
to the goal of reaching the preferred

2205
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,440
state so wouldn't it be simple if we

2206
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,520
could just infer how the map looked in

2207
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,280
the past and then make decisions based

2208
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,280
upon how the map looked in the past but

2209
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,679
that opens up to all these

2210
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,000
basically failures of function in

2211
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,560
changing environments

2212
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,280
g in formalism 3

2213
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,719
is a

2214
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,239
sum across over a given time horizon t

2215
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,400
so the expected free energy g of pi and

2216
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,080
t policy and time

2217
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,320
for a given certain policy pi and time

2218
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,600
step t in the future is defined as

2219
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,440
and this is going to be another set of

2220
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,480
formalisms but we can just pull back

2221
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,800
and remind ourselves of that sentence

2222
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
from the introduction active inference

2223
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
is a process theory of the brain

2224
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,960
that casts action as perception as two

2225
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,719
sides of the same coin

2226
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:01,520
so

2227
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,440
variational free energy which is more

2228
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,040
perceptual like

2229
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,880
because it's looking in past observed

2230
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,920
states

2231
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,960
and then g which is going to introduce

2232
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,360
the uncertainty of action in an

2233
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,960
uncertain future

2234
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,600
how an f how are f and g similar or

2235
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,480
different

2236
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,639
how are they being cast as two sides of

2237
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,080
the same coin

2238
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,400
how through the present

2239
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,719
are those two processes being reconciled

2240
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,880
because time step five from now is going

2241
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,719
to be like now

2242
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,679
then

2243
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,440
so how will we have continuity in

2244
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,600
dealing with certain moments like now

2245
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,719
but then there's things that we're

2246
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,639
uncertain about in the past and the

2247
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,480
present and the future and they're all

2248
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,000
very quite different kinds and they have

2249
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,239
different relationships to past actions

2250
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,159
and that's like the blockchain angle you

2251
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,639
can't change the past you can change

2252
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,560
your interpretation of the past but then

2253
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,960
there's a different kind of variability

2254
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,040
or openness in inferences about the

2255
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,880
future so

2256
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,800
these are great questions to learn about

2257
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,280
and think about how are f and g similar

2258
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,520
and different what is variational free

2259
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,159
energy what is expected free energy what

2260
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:08,719
is free energy of the expected future

2261
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,040
which baron millage at all have

2262
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,199
introduced and what other kinds of

2263
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,800
representations

2264
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,199
of this nexus

2265
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,040
are relevant to think about because

2266
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:19,840
these

2267
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,920
cited papers and shown equations do not

2268
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,120
exhaust the richness of that setting

2269
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,920
but

2270
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,520
it's awesome how they pulled back to

2271
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,880
just this

2272
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,040
it's a function g

2273
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,800
of what you do

2274
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,840
pi

2275
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,760
and what horizon you're considering it

2276
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,719
over

2277
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,600
tau

2278
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,199
and then implicitly how you think about

2279
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,520
all of that and how you think about that

2280
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,080
so they both pulled out to a level that

2281
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,000
i think will provide a lot more

2282
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,480
discussion but also we have to get

2283
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,159
specific in order for that robot to be

2284
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,719
in the warehouse

2285
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,159
yeah and

2286
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,440
the only fascinating observation for me

2287
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,480
um

2288
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,480
like obviously there's a there's a lot

2289
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,719
uh in this slide because

2290
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,800
uh this is the entire model this is the

2291
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,360
crux of uh the entire calculation where

2292
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,320
you have

2293
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,400
variational free energy and

2294
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,320
the expected free energy and you see the

2295
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,199
similarity between both um these

2296
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,360
formulae where divergence and log

2297
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,440
evidence is mentioned and then

2298
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,320
complexity and accuracy are terms of

2299
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,159
that formula and eventually it comes

2300
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,480
down to risk and ambiguity in the

2301
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,239
expected free energy

2302
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,000
formula when

2303
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,320
all the probabilities are given a

2304
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,719
certain policy and on a particular time

2305
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:39,520
horizon um so which is represented by

2306
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,000
tao so these terms like divergence

2307
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,600
complexity risk

2308
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,080
are like in one bucket um

2309
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,760
and

2310
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,120
log evidence accuracy and ambiguity are

2311
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,480
like in the

2312
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,159
same similar category in those two

2313
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,600
formulae

2314
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,040
awesome um i think we will as we expect

2315
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,760
the unexpected will start to actually

2316
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,920
accelerate through because the goal of

2317
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,600
the dot zero is really to set a lot of

2318
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,880
that context because that is what brings

2319
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,520
one to the trailhead so to speak for a

2320
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,719
lot of the details that they're going to

2321
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,360
present and of course the accuracy of

2322
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,960
their experiments and the implications

2323
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,320
and everything like that

2324
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,560
so we're just going to sort of

2325
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,760
continue on knowing that that

2326
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,080
getting there is getting quite a far

2327
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,679
away with this paper and then we're

2328
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,560
gonna go slightly faster through many

2329
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,719
other aspects of the paper just like

2330
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,199
give it a first pass

2331
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,960
so um here in formalism five

2332
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,080
they are casting p of pi the

2333
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,880
distribution of policies as a soft max

2334
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,639
sigma

2335
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,000
of the free energy on policy and this

2336
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,719
temperature parameter gamma

2337
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,639
this is casting planning as an inference

2338
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,040
problem which allows one to go from like

2339
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,040
the relative free energies of different

2340
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,239
policies to a decision on those policies

2341
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,920
and when there's high temperature it's

2342
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,159
like the pie chart is made but one is

2343
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:06,960
still

2344
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,880
um just picking from the different

2345
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,600
policies um as if they had relatively

2346
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,440
more equal pies whereas when the

2347
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,000
temperature is low like absolute zero

2348
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,639
then one is selecting the best policy

2349
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,040
like more than it should be expected in

2350
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,080
a way

2351
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,360
um

2352
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,440
and so that gamma reflects the

2353
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,040
confidence that the agent has in current

2354
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,800
beliefs over policies so when there's a

2355
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,679
lot of confidence then the most uh

2356
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,080
the best expected policy selected always

2357
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,679
when there's low confidence then it's

2358
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,840
not taken into account as much and

2359
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,600
that's of course a fun to think about in

2360
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,280
the context of like expecting the

2361
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,639
unexpected i think i can i think i can

2362
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,400
and then it says on the bottom right no

2363
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,080
one had the heart to tell him he was

2364
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,639
going the wrong way so one can think

2365
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,239
they can and be acting consistent with

2366
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,600
their model

2367
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,480
and going the wrong way relative to what

2368
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,719
so there's a lot again there that

2369
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,280
connects like the math to some broader

2370
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,920
questions that we all have

2371
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,639
what do you think

2372
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,040
yeah totally agree and the meme really

2373
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,440
brings the point home

2374
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,560
so

2375
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,440
yeah let's go to the next one and um in

2376
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,800
37

2377
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,880
live stream number 37 people can read

2378
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,960
about this dual interpretation

2379
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,760
of

2380
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,600
preferences and expectations and about

2381
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,320
how they co-realize each other

2382
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,440
so section 3.2 they move to the

2383
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,120
hierarchical generative model for

2384
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,239
navigation

2385
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,239
and here it's the same

2386
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,920
higher and lower model with blue at the

2387
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,600
lower time scale red at the higher level

2388
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,000
and it's going to be basically as we

2389
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,639
spent more time on previously but just

2390
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,199
applied to this multi-scale navigation

2391
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,880
problem where it was being approached a

2392
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,880
little bit more abstractly before so in

2393
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,840
formalism 6 they're going to have their

2394
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,760
big joint model

2395
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,480
be

2396
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,840
all the things that one would want to

2397
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,600
know in this whole nested model

2398
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,120
that's why previously when we saw the

2399
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,560
p distribution there was only four

2400
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,480
variables because it was considered at

2401
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,639
like just a more simple

2402
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,199
kernel layer and this is writing it out

2403
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,679
for the whole

2404
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,600
nested model where there's actions and

2405
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,320
moves so it moves across these two

2406
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,199
layers being jointly considered

2407
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,040
and then it's going to be like this

2408
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,080
multiplication between the lower level

2409
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,360
distribution and the higher level

2410
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,560
distribution

2411
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,480
because it can be factorized across

2412
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,239
these two levels because they're

2413
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,760
sparsely connected

2414
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,760
because of how it was designed

2415
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,400
so that simplification takes like sort

2416
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,639
of an all by all model

2417
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,159
and just

2418
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,159
at this level that corresponds

2419
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,480
graphically to the sparse connectivity

2420
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,880
allows those two to kind of twist

2421
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,480
a little bit independently from each

2422
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,280
other

2423
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,040
yet also

2424
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,159
containing a common basis in this joint

2425
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,800
distribution

2426
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,639
anything to add

2427
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,239
no i think this will be clarified

2428
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,000
further in the next slide which goes

2429
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,960
into global policy selection

2430
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,159
all right so in the higher level uh red

2431
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,239
the global policy is emitted every move

2432
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,199
is treated independent of each other

2433
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,960
this hierarchical arrangement allows the

2434
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,280
system to reason about its environment

2435
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,040
further ahead both temporally and

2436
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,159
spatially

2437
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,440
and so then they take this joint

2438
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,639
distribution

2439
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,840
and it gets broken down into these three

2440
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,000
terms from formalism 7 we can see the

2441
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,239
generative model decomposes into terms

2442
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,800
for both the lower level dynamics blue

2443
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,040
i.e how actions influence the next state

2444
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,080
and pose

2445
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,600
so we we broke the blue out from the red

2446
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,360
and then there's this other term which

2447
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,120
we can talk about from the joint

2448
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,719
distribution

2449
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,520
what do you think

2450
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:57,600
yeah

2451
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,520
yeah i think the

2452
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,639
this is uh where it comes to expressing

2453
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,040
in terms of g which was the expected

2454
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,520
free energy and we see those terms

2455
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,320
repeat here and i think this is i think

2456
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,280
the most important formula of this paper

2457
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,360
in which the global policy selection

2458
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,280
happens

2459
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,920
and at the higher level yeah

2460
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,280
okay so

2461
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,880
as we saw before with the simpler

2462
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,280
version first there was a decomposition

2463
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,199
on p there's a factorization on a p

2464
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,040
distribution we saw this with like with

2465
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,040
a simpler p

2466
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,320
here

2467
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,040
they then got turned into an f and a g

2468
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,639
here we have a more full featured p

2469
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,880
it is also going to be

2470
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,480
turned into an f

2471
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,400
which is the variational free energy and

2472
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,679
then a g

2473
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,320
so this is f of the hierarchical model

2474
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,600
they write now that we've fully

2475
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,760
specified our generative model that was

2476
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,719
p the factorized joint distribution

2477
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,880
we again turn the variational

2478
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,440
f and then later the expected g

2479
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,520
free energy that will be minimized in

2480
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,040
active inference

2481
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,760
so it's a variational uh distribution q

2482
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,360
that they're fitting and they take the

2483
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,440
same approach as they took earlier with

2484
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
the single layer model and they reach

2485
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,000
this hierarchical free energy

2486
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,639
that can be rewritten by the bottom row

2487
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:20,800
as the decomposition of the free energy

2488
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,040
of the lower model and of the higher

2489
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,360
model so i think it'll be great to hear

2490
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,280
the authors like how did they reach this

2491
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,560
and what

2492
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,600
do they think it means and

2493
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,679
so on but i think the awesome question

2494
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,440
to think about here is how do we think

2495
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,840
about free energy minimization in

2496
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,600
multi-agent and multi-scale systems

2497
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,080
how do free energy decompositions work

2498
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,679
and what if

2499
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,639
nine do really well then one doesn't how

2500
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:49,760
does that

2501
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,760
group outcome

2502
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,000
get traded off against well everybody's

2503
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,679
doing a little bit worse but isn't that

2504
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,360
better than one person doing a lot worse

2505
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,280
well it depends by how much you mean by

2506
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,800
a lot and a little in the situation and

2507
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,280
so on so how does all of that going to

2508
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,760
be amenable to these kinds of seemingly

2509
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,040
cut and dry

2510
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,840
decompositions

2511
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,639
yeah that is an excellent question and

2512
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,480
another question that i would add to

2513
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,000
this is

2514
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,920
how many terms can you decompose this

2515
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,080
into as you think about more and more

2516
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,920
models so here here we have a lower

2517
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,400
level and a higher level but

2518
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,480
can there be multiple levels for

2519
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,600
different kinds of scenarios

2520
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,719
awesome

2521
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:31,600
okay

2522
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,480
so

2523
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,719
they are now going to pick up on that

2524
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,719
bottom line there's a low and high

2525
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,560
decomposition of the hierarchical

2526
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,800
variational free energy and they write

2527
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,480
this falls apart into a term for the

2528
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,760
lower level and the higher level of the

2529
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,679
hierarchy which we can further unpack

2530
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,679
for the higher level we get

2531
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,400
and then they provide a expansion of

2532
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,120
that f high and f low

2533
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,679
and these have the same complexity and

2534
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,679
accuracy interpretation as we saw with

2535
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,199
the previous f

2536
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:00,800
except that this complexity minus

2537
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,120
accuracy can be understood as being

2538
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,600
about only the higher level and this

2539
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,920
complexity minus accuracy

2540
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,159
on lower level can be interpreted as

2541
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,400
being about only the lower level so it's

2542
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,120
like been a separation of consideration

2543
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,040
between these levels but again they're

2544
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,679
coming from a common joint distribution

2545
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,159
so that is just like a example of taking

2546
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,920
the analogous logic

2547
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,520
and path that was followed on the single

2548
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,719
level model

2549
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:27,520
then

2550
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,760
using this composable framework making

2551
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,840
the nest degenerative model and then

2552
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,679
being able to apply the same kinds of

2553
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,679
techniques to reach the same kinds of

2554
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,760
conclusions but now in this different

2555
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,159
context

2556
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,960
anything yeah totally agree yeah

2557
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,880
splitting it into like these very

2558
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,800
specific terms and differentiating the

2559
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,199
forest from the trees where high is the

2560
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,360
forest and the lower level are the trees

2561
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,159
is

2562
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,520
very very

2563
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,600
helpful and it also shows how they are

2564
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,360
related and not related

2565
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,480
awesome um so now they're going to make

2566
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,920
that f to g move when considering future

2567
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,679
time steps tau the variational free

2568
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,000
energy becomes an expected free energy

2569
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,320
which again unfolds to a term for each

2570
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,320
level in the hierarchy so they're going

2571
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,560
to do that f high and f low

2572
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,239
type decomposition but it's going to be

2573
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,199
about g the expected free energy and so

2574
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,880
here's the low on the right and the high

2575
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,000
on the left

2576
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,719
and so here there's that same risk plus

2577
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:28,239
ambiguity

2578
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,639
but now it's being applied to the

2579
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,880
decomposition between the high and the

2580
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,760
low

2581
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,239
and so similarly to equation four this

2582
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,159
unpacks in a risk term to reach a prior

2583
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,440
goal location

2584
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,679
and an ambiguity term intuitively this

2585
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,760
means the agent selects a route to its

2586
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,560
goal location with the lowest ambiguity

2587
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,159
hence if the agent operates in a

2588
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,840
completely static environment without

2589
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,000
uncertainty this basically becomes

2590
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,239
equivalent to shortest path planning so

2591
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,400
that was really interesting to you know

2592
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,400
hear about again in the context of what

2593
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,480
you described like well-mapped

2594
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,440
well-connected real-time updating

2595
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,159
highly controlled settings the future is

2596
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,719
more like f than it is like g

2597
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,159
because it's like you can just trust in

2598
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,760
the future that you'll get a snapshot

2599
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,440
update and you'll be able to make the

2600
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,719
perfect move

2601
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,159
because you'll be able to do shortest

2602
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,760
path planning and traditional

2603
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,719
optimization techniques because you'll

2604
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,400
have no ambiguity um about

2605
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,119
the

2606
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,440
future basically in the short term and

2607
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,320
then that gets more complex when there

2608
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,600
actually is

2609
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,880
different kinds and different patterns

2610
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,159
of ambiguity in the future so it's just

2611
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,760
like such a cool way to hear about it

2612
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,280
now

2613
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,000
yeah good enough said it better

2614
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,400
similar thoughts on this particular

2615
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,840
framing

2616
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,080
okay so that was section three

2617
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,080
in section four

2618
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,560
there now we still haven't seen

2619
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,760
active

2620
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,520
applied yet we haven't seen any action

2621
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,119
perception loops it's been like very

2622
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,880
analytical to this point

2623
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,760
so now in section four they're going to

2624
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,159
actually bring that

2625
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,159
generative model

2626
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,320
into active inference so they write now

2627
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,159
we've established our generative model

2628
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,760
in the variational free energy

2629
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,000
optimization objectives we present how

2630
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,840
to instantiate such a model in silica

2631
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,320
for navigation on a real robot with

2632
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,480
camera input so it's kind of interesting

2633
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,080
because in silico often means like we

2634
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,800
only simulated it but here it means we

2635
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,920
implemented it on a silicon processor

2636
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,000
yeah in a uh

2637
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,679
in a real embedded situation and so

2638
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,400
um

2639
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,639
the observations are the raw pixels from

2640
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:35,920
the camera sensor and the actions

2641
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,159
consist of the commands specifying the

2642
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,119
linear and angular velocity so that is

2643
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,800
just taking that generative model

2644
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,320
structure that we described kind of

2645
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,560
abstractly like the we just talked about

2646
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,159
the observed observations but is that a

2647
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:51,280
one pixel camera is it a 4k video is it

2648
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,440
lidar like this is where they are going

2649
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,920
to connect it to the specifics of what

2650
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,360
they actually do in the robot

2651
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,360
yeah yeah the only thing will add is

2652
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,600
again this picture because

2653
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,920
it's such a helpful picture in framing

2654
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,880
the

2655
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,199
pixels and the sensors that that are

2656
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,320
being captured in their case as well so

2657
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,320
they are taking just this camera inputs

2658
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,639
which is rg and b values

2659
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,119
for this particular paper as well as

2660
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,119
like the imu units and the odometry

2661
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:24,320
units which is velocity

2662
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,520
awesome

2663
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,520
so in section four one

2664
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,880
they

2665
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,840
highlight the visual perceptive aspects

2666
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,520
of their model we're not going to

2667
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,800
describe it here we'll hear about it

2668
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,360
soon but for one focuses on that visual

2669
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,960
perceptive aspect

2670
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,239
for two

2671
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,000
which we're also not going to focus on

2672
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,880
here

2673
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,800
takes it a little bit

2674
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,199
out from the visual perception you know

2675
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,520
how is the tree recognized given the

2676
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,360
retina and this is like the path

2677
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,560
integration

2678
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,159
around those trees

2679
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,480
so this is a path integration

2680
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,679
approach

2681
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:00,239
and then they also

2682
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,440
bring up some points about how this has

2683
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,480
some similarities on the biological side

2684
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,560
and also they introduced this

2685
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,360
topological map component of the higher

2686
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,360
generative higher level generative model

2687
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,600
the red model um do anything to add

2688
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,760
especially maybe about that topological

2689
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,280
basis of the higher model

2690
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,400
yeah so

2691
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,800
i mean this is where it's uh attaching

2692
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,119
it to like the physical world uh this is

2693
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,440
where the lower levels and higher levels

2694
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,719
get connected

2695
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,080
through these particular formulations so

2696
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,600
yeah this is a question i will have for

2697
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,639
the authors as well like how is this uh

2698
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:44,000
can cn network represented and why did

2699
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
they choose this particular

2700
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,600
framing of

2701
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,520
connecting the two levels yeah they

2702
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,280
write the posterior distribution that's

2703
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,280
the one that we control is represented

2704
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,840
by a continuous attractor network a can

2705
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,239
a 3d cube that wraps around the edges

2706
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,719
with these different dimensions

2707
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,639
so that might enforce some type of

2708
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:03,920
closure

2709
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,760
on the network which we also saw

2710
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,360
happening with the rat slam but that'll

2711
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,280
be a good thing to ask

2712
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,159
okay

2713
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,239
so then in section 4-3 they highlight

2714
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:13,119
the

2715
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:16,080
the localization and mapping

2716
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,600
these are being simultaneously inferred

2717
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,880
so it's a slam

2718
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,980
and this is um

2719
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,199
[Music]

2720
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:22,719
the localization and mapping features

2721
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,360
which are another level kind of above or

2722
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,080
different than just path integration

2723
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,920
and they relate that to the higher level

2724
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,880
model

2725
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,239
so they provide some other formalisms

2726
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,360
and uh

2727
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,360
maybe this gets at what we were

2728
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,480
discussing

2729
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,639
due to odometry integration drift so

2730
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,119
inaccuracy about how many footsteps you

2731
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,239
took like that's the kind of the reason

2732
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,000
why people apparently walk in a circle

2733
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,920
when they're lost in a list landscape

2734
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,199
because they have like a little bit of a

2735
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,960
different step length and so they have

2736
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,280
drift in their heading

2737
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,960
matching experiences will not have

2738
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,360
exactly the same associated pose

2739
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,639
these displacement errors are

2740
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,239
distributed throughout the graph by use

2741
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,480
of graph relaxation shifting the stored

2742
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,080
pose according to

2743
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,840
equation 16.

2744
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,199
this enforces the map to be

2745
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,679
topologically consistent even after loop

2746
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:13,920
closures which is often challenging in

2747
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,239
metric slam systems so that definitely

2748
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,480
gets at stephen's information geography

2749
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,480
or information geometry versus

2750
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,520
information topology because if we

2751
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,719
enforce a rigid geometry then tiny

2752
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:29,440
differences might drive us wild but if

2753
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,560
we enforce topological closure then

2754
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,239
even if a road like became thirty

2755
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,080
percent longer we'd still be able to

2756
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,600
navigate from

2757
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,760
city one to city two and it wouldn't be

2758
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,719
so bothersome

2759
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,080
yeah

2760
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,840
yeah and

2761
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,159
including drift is like one of the

2762
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:49,920
fundamental things all robotics

2763
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,800
experiments have to do because um

2764
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,600
everything that we formulate via math

2765
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,800
never seems to work out well in actual

2766
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,560
physical sensors and actuators there's

2767
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,719
always that drift term that needs to be

2768
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,119
added and i like how they have handled

2769
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,679
uh like the drift here

2770
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,320
awesome in section four four

2771
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,600
they

2772
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,320
discuss and highlight the navigation

2773
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,880
features and here we'll talk more i just

2774
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,800
want to raise these questions because

2775
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,320
they make up like three of the

2776
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,480
perspectives that are really getting

2777
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,880
integrated and recombined here and you

2778
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,800
spoke to it right there how do

2779
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,199
mathematical entities navigate

2780
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:30,960
like bayesian graph models and

2781
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,280
generative models how do biological

2782
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,440
entities navigate and how do robotic

2783
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,080
entities navigate and

2784
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,600
what are their similarities and

2785
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,679
differences and different opportunities

2786
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,239
and challenges and how will we

2787
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,080
generalize and make the right kinds of

2788
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,560
connections across different systems

2789
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,119
within these domains and across and

2790
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,520
among these domains so that's an awesome

2791
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,119
complexity question i hope a lot of

2792
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:58,080
people can enter into these questions

2793
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,400
and like provide their thought and be

2794
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,119
involved in this

2795
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,800
yeah i mean this could be a whole

2796
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,360
section on navigating navigation which

2797
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,080
is um like an interesting topic for

2798
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,400
complexity

2799
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,679
awesome

2800
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,760
okay section five and this will be i

2801
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,840
think just fascinating to hear their

2802
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,080
hands-on experience about these

2803
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,320
experiments which we're not going to go

2804
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,639
into too much detail in but in section 5

2805
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:26,159
they describe their setup and

2806
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:28,159
implementation so

2807
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,400
this is a tele operation of a mobile

2808
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,000
robot in a lab with a warehouse style

2809
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,600
and they describe some details about

2810
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,280
like what kind of robot they use what

2811
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,520
kind of camera was used and how many

2812
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,560
data points existed and then they talk a

2813
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,199
little bit about their implementation of

2814
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:47,119
how that generative model

2815
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:48,400
became

2816
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,480
basically implemented using machine

2817
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:55,199
learning as a lstm network

2818
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,560
yeah this is where this is this is the

2819
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,560
most fun part of the paper for many

2820
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,080
robotics

2821
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,560
like researchers because this is like

2822
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,800
the standard robotic toolkit that's used

2823
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,280
in almost all robotics labs around the

2824
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,600
world turtlebot has become like this

2825
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,639
raspberry pi of robots in which every

2826
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,360
lab has one and anyone can replicate

2827
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,000
this kind of an experiment easily and

2828
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,679
it's interesting that they have access

2829
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:23,760
to like all these sensors that they talk

2830
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,880
about such as lidar and millimeter wave

2831
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,280
radar but they only use uh like the

2832
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,199
minimal set of sensors they need which

2833
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:34,880
is the rgb data and

2834
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,520
that is what they use to collect data

2835
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,760
points and they are sampling it at like

2836
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,480
an interval which is very close to human

2837
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,040
perception like 100 milliseconds it gets

2838
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,800
close to

2839
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,679
like biological level perception um like

2840
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,000
the frame rate that we have for our

2841
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,400
sensory organs so

2842
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,440
that is

2843
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,040
very interesting and the implementation

2844
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,000
is even

2845
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,239
um more interesting where they

2846
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:02,400
which we have to definitely ask um the

2847
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:07,040
authors about how they use this setup

2848
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,639
thank you great

2849
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,239
uh in figure three

2850
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:13,440
they show on the right side uh a picture

2851
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,880
of the bot turtle bot so there it is

2852
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,360
and then on the left side we see some

2853
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,000
still images of the lab

2854
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,840
warehouse seen at different points so

2855
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,239
like here point one on the map is

2856
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,639
corresponding to what was seen as like

2857
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,080
approaching this wall and kind of doing

2858
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,600
a u-turn and um so this is the path that

2859
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,159
was taken as it was kind of uh

2860
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,119
circulating these warehouse house um

2861
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:42,239
shelves basically um yeah well and also

2862
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:43,440
i really appreciate how you like you

2863
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,880
described um the the commonality of

2864
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,920
these techniques um because those i i

2865
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,280
just didn't know that this was such a

2866
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,239
common

2867
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,719
hardware and it'd be awesome to see like

2868
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,000
what it will look like when people start

2869
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,560
to deploy it in different settings

2870
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,880
yeah um and it's important because they

2871
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,280
use ross first of all turtlebot uses the

2872
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,239
robot operating system and um like if

2873
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:07,440
this is the first time people are

2874
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,360
looking at a turtlebot and by just

2875
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,880
looking at the image you can tell that

2876
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,040
it's a roomba with like a shelf on top

2877
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:16,080
of it with many different sensors so

2878
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,159
honestly that's all there is so the

2879
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,679
movement

2880
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:22,000
movement is done by like the vacuum

2881
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,480
cleaner on the bottom

2882
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,480
the cleaning robot module on the bottom

2883
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,480
of the robot and then the rest of the

2884
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,360
rack the rack is full of sensors where

2885
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,840
you see the cameras attached so earlier

2886
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,280
there used to be connect cameras

2887
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,600
attached and you can attach any sorts of

2888
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,719
additional

2889
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,560
units on top of it and then there's a

2890
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,280
processing unit there which

2891
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,280
like takes in all those inputs and does

2892
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,400
all the calculations on board so so yeah

2893
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,560
reproducibility in robotics research is

2894
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,960
extremely rare and using a technique

2895
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,760
like this uh definitely helps for other

2896
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,840
labs to reproduce these kinds of results

2897
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,760
yeah thanks for that and i'd be really

2898
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,199
curious to learn more also about like

2899
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,960
the edge computing

2900
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,360
implications like is that a mini pc what

2901
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,280
exactly is needed here what if the model

2902
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,000
were 100 times simpler what if it were a

2903
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,679
hundred times more complex

2904
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,840
so in figure five

2905
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,159
section five three they discussed their

2906
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:21,360
results and they asked three research

2907
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,480
questions

2908
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,560
and those are addressed in the following

2909
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,639
sections so they ask does that lower

2910
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,639
level model learn accurate

2911
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,000
representations for inference and

2912
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,800
prediction by minimizing free energy so

2913
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,440
does the lower level work

2914
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,600
two can these representations be used in

2915
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,159
the hierarchical model

2916
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,159
for generating topological maps of the

2917
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:45,119
environment because although we kind of

2918
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,639
didn't discuss it in detail that is that

2919
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,280
topological closure that's impressed

2920
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,880
upon at the higher level but not at the

2921
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,400
lower level so can the lower level work

2922
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,480
and then can it be used as a useful

2923
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,440
interface with this totally different in

2924
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,400
type

2925
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,360
topologically closed higher level model

2926
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,239
and then the holistic question is

2927
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,639
does the system infer sensible moves and

2928
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,560
actions by minimizing expected free

2929
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,360
energy to engage in navigation like okay

2930
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,960
given that the two components are

2931
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,800
interfacing does the whole thing do

2932
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,280
free energy minimization in a way that

2933
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,320
ends up doing so-called sensible moves

2934
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,560
that is maybe what um

2935
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,400
a person would do if they said just

2936
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,880
patrol that warehouse just walk around

2937
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,800
without any too specific of a goal but

2938
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,320
just make sure that you walk everywhere

2939
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,440
pretty much

2940
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:36,960
that's pretty sensible they didn't spend

2941
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,480
any time over here

2942
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,480
they didn't just go up and down one

2943
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,800
shelf so that's sensible even though

2944
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,320
there's not quite a heuristic for that

2945
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,080
but i think that's really a fascinating

2946
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,760
question what is sensible behavior

2947
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,960
yeah

2948
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,920
and i think they go into how they

2949
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,560
quantify sensible behavior by comparing

2950
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,560
it with other approaches in the results

2951
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,239
so it will be interesting to ask the

2952
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,239
authors about that

2953
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:03,040
yeah

2954
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,440
okay table one just goes into some

2955
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,119
details about their neural network

2956
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,280
parameterization we'll hear about it

2957
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,199
from the authors so how did neural

2958
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:12,639
networks come into play what was the

2959
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,880
process of fitting that

2960
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,840
okay

2961
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,119
figure four

2962
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,639
all right figure four

2963
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,239
is the

2964
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,000
sequences of the ground truth

2965
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,800
observations first row so that's the

2966
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,040
video data coming in on the top that's

2967
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,920
like just looks like regular video data

2968
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,639
reconstructed observations second row

2969
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,119
that's the generative model of visual

2970
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:36,880
input and that's kind of like thinking

2971
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,159
about this in terms like a course

2972
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:40,080
grading but this brings the visual input

2973
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,400
into the robot's terms

2974
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,599
corresponding to latent space samples

2975
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:46,800
third row

2976
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,599
so this is like potentially um an

2977
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,920
internal representation like a layer of

2978
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,280
a neural network

2979
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,960
and so um

2980
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,119
it's just showing that these perhaps

2981
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:59,360
very similar or different scenes can be

2982
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,960
differentiated

2983
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,920
via

2984
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,840
their position in like a higher

2985
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,400
dimensional latent space or it's lower

2986
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,320
dimensional in the video but it's higher

2987
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,920
dimensional than just like the x and the

2988
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,159
y

2989
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:13,920
the robot is turning towards the left in

2990
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,400
the sequence as can be seen from both

2991
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,320
the sequence of observation as well as

2992
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,320
the shift towards higher theta values in

2993
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,639
the pose cube and that's the pose cube

2994
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:25,199
activation on the bottom row

2995
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,960
so this is what it looks like at that

2996
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,480
lower model to go from video data

2997
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,560
to hidden state estimation the kind of

2998
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,119
core screening generative model of the

2999
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:36,400
video

3000
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,080
to this latent state internal

3001
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,360
representation

3002
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,840
to the pose estimation that's going to

3003
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,840
come into play at the higher level of

3004
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,760
the model they're kind of overlaying

3005
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,080
time steps as columns during this

3006
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,760
execution of a turn

3007
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,520
and showing how different layers of that

3008
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,440
lower model are updating

3009
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,320
yeah um and i think this is a time

3010
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,800
series like you described left to right

3011
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,360
indicates um like

3012
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,920
10 seconds for example 10 seconds of a

3013
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,239
turn of a robot and

3014
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,639
that was an interesting comment on the

3015
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,480
higher level dimension for a robot is

3016
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,880
lower level fidelity for us with those

3017
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,800
pixels so

3018
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,960
so yeah the way we represent things and

3019
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,080
the way it's represented in a robot um

3020
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,840
can have very different terminologies

3021
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,560
yeah and higher lower inner outer more

3022
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,760
less

3023
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,080
it's always in relationship and so those

3024
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,080
can sometimes get swept under the rug

3025
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,679
it's a high dimensional representation

3026
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,920
that we did of this

3027
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,080
you know what's what do you have to ask

3028
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:45,679
in 42.0 how high

3029
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,159
it's just a few pixels

3030
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,520
in figure five um they show

3031
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,560
uh the generated experience map left and

3032
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,159
a comparison map extracted from

3033
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:01,040
localization with our tab map so i show

3034
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,599
citation here but i would love to hear

3035
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:06,239
your interpretation of what do they mean

3036
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,960
by the experience map is topological

3037
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,239
while the r tab map is metric what are

3038
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:16,560
being shown differently here here

3039
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,080
yeah so um so yeah they are comparing

3040
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,239
the figure that they obtained on the

3041
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:25,760
left with uh the data obtained from a

3042
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,520
similar technique so the way these

3043
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,840
robotics experiments work is they use

3044
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
different localization techniques and

3045
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,520
they are using our tab

3046
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,280
map which is another technique on the

3047
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,840
right and yeah the second point is very

3048
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,599
interesting and i think that is

3049
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,480
stephen's question as well which is

3050
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,480
how is the information

3051
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,880
geography represented so

3052
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,080
the experience map which is uh on the

3053
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,440
left it briefly describes how

3054
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,440
like the environment is

3055
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:58,440
topologically

3056
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,040
yeah closed and

3057
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,000
the rtap map is accurate to like

3058
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,679
physical world metric

3059
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:08,880
uh units which is measurements so

3060
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,040
so topology just means like how

3061
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,440
everything is oriented it doesn't need

3062
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,159
to be physically precise um as a real

3063
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,199
world it's

3064
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,040
like wisdom versus

3065
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,520
knowledge so topology is more

3066
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,960
uh more of an idea that uh that if you

3067
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,880
follow this kind of a map you will find

3068
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,880
your way and you won't get lost whereas

3069
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,520
metric is um like precise

3070
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,679
mapping of the physical environment and

3071
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,960
mapping it to scale like one is to 20 or

3072
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,880
one is 200 whatever that scale may be

3073
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,280
i really like that knowledge and wisdom

3074
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,760
and then here's um why there's always

3075
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,080
the minimum of two and why we respect

3076
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,599
both because the topological maps may be

3077
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,760
totally non-comparable

3078
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,239
in their geometry for two different

3079
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:58,800
entities mapping the same space

3080
01:53:58,800 --> 01:53:59,840
and so

3081
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,760
if we are both trying to get the

3082
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,080
geometry of the geography that's where

3083
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,159
it's possible to have the most objective

3084
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:07,440
agreement

3085
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,280
on the knowledge

3086
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,320
side

3087
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,760
allegorically

3088
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,719
here

3089
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,880
and then the topological side can be so

3090
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,480
much simpler

3091
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,560
and so much more personalized and local

3092
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,239
and can actually help in those way

3093
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:23,119
finding the changing situations

3094
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,119
and maybe there's analogy or there's

3095
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,040
resonance or there's small

3096
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,840
isomorphisms with different wisdoms

3097
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,520
but

3098
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,480
one has gone down that path and has

3099
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,040
basically given up making the image on

3100
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,960
the right that other people will just

3101
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,719
see and recognize as oh yeah that

3102
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,800
totally lines up with what i see

3103
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,159
so that's quite a nice point

3104
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:47,760
yeah

3105
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,080
okay figure six uh is some more outputs

3106
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,360
of the model

3107
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,599
so they uh

3108
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:58,000
right imaginary policies

3109
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,880
uh oh imaginary policies oh so there's

3110
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,480
several images of different things

3111
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,360
happening

3112
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,360
there's the current state

3113
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,679
which is the video input at that time

3114
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:08,639
step

3115
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:10,639
and then there's imagined short-term

3116
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:12,960
goals i want it to look like this i want

3117
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,639
the frame differencing

3118
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:17,679
at that time step to be super small i

3119
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:19,679
want to be really unsurprised about

3120
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,760
looking like this at that short time

3121
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:24,400
step in this turn you can kind of see

3122
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,920
that

3123
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,840
piece on the left that's getting brought

3124
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,320
more into view as i turn my head left i

3125
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,840
don't want to be surprised i want it to

3126
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,040
feel normal

3127
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,440
and then in the long term goal there's a

3128
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,840
lot more like blurriness

3129
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,760
because it's not super important whether

3130
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,320
the handle is here or here

3131
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:46,080
because it's just an uncertain future

3132
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,440
and so these are imagined policies that

3133
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,080
can be considered at past present and

3134
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,239
future time steps and that's kind of

3135
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,400
what the partial observability of the

3136
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,280
hidden markov model structure or motif

3137
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,440
brings into this picture this is why

3138
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,599
it's good to have a generative model

3139
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:04,880
rather than just

3140
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,280
a recognition or an input a signal

3141
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,040
processing model that's like where the

3142
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,800
whole generative bayesian concept and

3143
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,320
predictive processing from the

3144
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:15,119
biological side come into play

3145
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,880
and also in the future it trails off

3146
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,800
these are the same time series and

3147
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,639
further and further in the future it

3148
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,159
gets blurrier and blurrier until it's

3149
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:24,159
like i just want to be in a horizontal

3150
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:25,119
plane

3151
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:26,840
in the future

3152
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,719
basically standing yeah

3153
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,679
yeah yeah figure d is like um very

3154
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,840
interesting in this particular picture

3155
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,840
where they have three different policies

3156
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:40,560
and you see very different results

3157
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,480
as a result of those policies

3158
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,880
so this is uh like robotics 101 behavior

3159
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,719
where you program the robot to always go

3160
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:50,960
left always go right or always go

3161
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,960
straight and you

3162
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,880
start with these particular policies and

3163
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,000
then um understand that these simple

3164
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,040
changes in behavior have like such

3165
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,760
vast differences in the results

3166
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,840
so yeah the sentence you just

3167
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,480
highlighted is yeah so so here the three

3168
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,800
policies are basically

3169
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,159
um

3170
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:13,360
the two different turns are going

3171
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,560
straight and so they say when

3172
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,880
calculating g low and evaluating the

3173
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:19,119
distribution on policies this results in

3174
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:20,719
a probability close to one to take the

3175
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:22,639
policy go left like look at how on the

3176
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,599
bottom row that's the go left policy

3177
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:28,080
it stays sharp in the future

3178
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,360
but then

3179
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,760
this the policies that diverge

3180
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,760
increasingly from the goals at different

3181
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,040
time scales

3182
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,360
with respect to those goals it becomes

3183
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,520
really unclear so it's like i want a

3184
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,360
hundred dollars so i'm saving one dollar

3185
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:44,400
per day then at day 71 i expect 71

3186
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,400
dollars wow it's exactly 71 dollars

3187
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,000
that's like this bottom time one and

3188
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
this is like i'm losing money every day

3189
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,239
i'm getting less and less clear on how

3190
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:54,080
it's going to end up at 100 at this

3191
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,239
future time step so

3192
01:57:56,239 --> 01:57:58,800
maybe that's not a good policy not

3193
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,800
because my expected value is dropping

3194
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,320
but because it's just it's unclear how

3195
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,000
i'm going to get to 100. and that's

3196
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
something that can be neutrally said

3197
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,440
without even taking a judgment on the

3198
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:10,879
amount at any given time step

3199
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,920
yeah

3200
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,040
yeah i think that analogy really drives

3201
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,840
the point home that you need to choose

3202
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,239
your policies according to the goals and

3203
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:21,840
i think all those goals were part of

3204
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,880
their uh formulation of the expected

3205
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,800
free energy so

3206
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,960
i think it's important to ask this to

3207
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,040
the authors like how were these goals as

3208
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,040
well as policies chosen

3209
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,440
and can this be generalized for

3210
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,920
different kinds of environments

3211
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,159
awesome so figure seven they write um

3212
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:43,920
different goals for the long term path

3213
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,560
of figure five so just here's the figure

3214
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,480
five again with the

3215
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,920
topological closure of the higher model

3216
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:54,080
the lower level dynamics model will take

3217
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,000
the corresponding states

3218
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,960
as preferred state goals sequentially

3219
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,360
so this is where we see that the

3220
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,360
connections between the models becoming

3221
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,119
enacted so let's just say that um one is

3222
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,520
coming around this edge and there's two

3223
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,520
options they can continue straight or

3224
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,360
they can go right or they can go in

3225
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,880
reverse but we're considering forward

3226
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,800
motion only so there's two alternate

3227
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,520
policy it's not the infinite space

3228
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,040
decision making that humans are

3229
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,880
sometimes confronted with but here it's

3230
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,280
a robotics motion decision about

3231
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,360
continuing straight ostensibly to

3232
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,040
explore this final right most uh

3233
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,760
shelf sequence or taking the right turn

3234
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:36,239
now so go straight or turn right

3235
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,639
now what would sensible behavior be if

3236
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,960
one had recently or repeatedly visited

3237
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,960
the closer shelf then to be more

3238
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,800
exploratory it would make sense to like

3239
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,639
go straight so that this last shelf

3240
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,040
could be explored so that's the kind of

3241
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,040
decision that we would want that robot

3242
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,760
to be able to incorporate when it's able

3243
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,560
to

3244
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,159
be making that decision

3245
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,840
and so that could be thought of as

3246
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,840
having a long-term goal

3247
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,880
to be

3248
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:04,000
expecting oneself to be on the far right

3249
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,480
shelf here the bottom one

3250
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,880
and then in the moment

3251
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,520
which one of these actions turn right or

3252
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,880
go straight

3253
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:15,440
is going to be preferred

3254
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,520
with respect to how one acts now and so

3255
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:18,639
then that's what it means to say the

3256
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:20,239
lower level dynamics model will take the

3257
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,400
corresponding states from the higher

3258
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,960
long-term path as the preferred state

3259
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,199
goals so then one could be like well i

3260
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:29,760
prefer to see myself just right here

3261
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,480
already one has chosen a branch

3262
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,480
but that is helping you reduce your

3263
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:37,440
uncertainty about being found here later

3264
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,599
so that although i really look forward

3265
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:40,800
to also hearing everyone else's like

3266
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,320
unpacking of like what is the robot

3267
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:45,679
doing or thinking in that pivot moment

3268
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,679
um that's like kind of how i read the

3269
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:50,080
way that the long term planning goals

3270
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,800
become imposed upon the lower level

3271
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:55,840
action selections

3272
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,320
yep i agree okay

3273
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,520
um

3274
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,080
what did you see or want to talk about

3275
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,520
with the contrast with other slam

3276
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,520
approaches

3277
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,760
let me see

3278
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:12,960
so yeah this

3279
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,239
paragraph um like describes different

3280
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:20,560
slam approaches and um you see the same

3281
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,320
like group of authors mentioned from

3282
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,320
probabilistic robotics where sebastian

3283
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,960
thrun and the co-authors are mentioned

3284
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,960
and those were engineered approaches

3285
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,199
which uh also used different kinds of

3286
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,639
bayesian

3287
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:34,800
like

3288
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,440
like statistics and then there were more

3289
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,440
bio-inspired approaches such as the rat

3290
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:43,360
slam group which is the 2013

3291
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,960
paper and then

3292
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,560
um yeah they rely on post can and this

3293
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:51,199
experience map which they compare it

3294
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,119
with and

3295
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:54,960
recently like deep learning has

3296
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,000
obviously been used on visual slam like

3297
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,040
you see in this uh like the bottom

3298
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:05,119
um like bottom of this paragraph and

3299
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:07,199
yeah

3300
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:08,960
the underlined

3301
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,400
section is important do you want to

3302
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,639
cover that the active inference

3303
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:15,599
allow for a holistic treatment

3304
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:17,599
i think that's where they bring it home

3305
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:19,440
which is they say well yeah yes people

3306
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,599
have used this recognition variational

3307
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,840
autoencoder model and yes there's been

3308
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,400
this topological approach to rat slam

3309
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,320
navigation closer and

3310
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,159
etc but then

3311
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,880
those are often again composed in in an

3312
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,560
ad hoc way

3313
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,480
uh and so

3314
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,719
active inference is providing a possible

3315
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:41,599
way to uh approach it in a more

3316
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:43,760
principled and more integrative first

3317
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:47,480
principles way

3318
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:48,719
okay

3319
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:50,080
um

3320
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,080
conclusion let's uh hear it from the

3321
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,080
authors people can draw their own

3322
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,520
conclusions but i'll just highlight the

3323
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,239
last

3324
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,320
sentence that we think this research

3325
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,400
direction might offer new insights both

3326
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,080
on how navigation works in the mammal

3327
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,520
brain

3328
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,199
as well as how to scale active inference

3329
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:07,360
to real world applications so it's like

3330
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:09,040
those were the three vectors we brought

3331
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,840
in with the biological mathematical and

3332
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,560
the robotics and then from that nexus

3333
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,159
it's kind of like it feeds back out

3334
02:03:16,159 --> 02:03:18,480
because now from the brain they might be

3335
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,400
learning about the math and the robots

3336
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,400
and then the others

3337
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,719
in a similar fashion

3338
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:25,520
yeah

3339
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,719
yeah and

3340
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:28,639
as the authors conclude the paper they

3341
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,400
also bring up some

3342
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,719
open questions such as can these

3343
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:34,560
techniques be used for lifelong learning

3344
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,480
which is a relatively new field of

3345
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:39,040
machine learning in which states change

3346
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,960
all the time and you do not need to

3347
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,119
retrain your model but you you do not

3348
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:46,480
you just need to um like retrain

3349
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,560
specific parts of your model to

3350
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,079
continuously learn throughout the

3351
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:52,960
lifetime of that application so um so

3352
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,760
they

3353
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,159
suggest something like a sleep cycle but

3354
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:58,480
that means that whenever the

3355
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,400
robot is charging that is when it can

3356
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:02,400
update its model of the entire

3357
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:05,360
environment and share that and

3358
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,480
do that

3359
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,719
active inference approach to achieve

3360
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,360
lifelong learning so i'll be

3361
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,760
very interested in knowing this from the

3362
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,840
authors like what are the weaknesses in

3363
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,560
this approach and how can this be solved

3364
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,599
to scale for real world applications

3365
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:23,360
awesome and how about just describe what

3366
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,719
this last video is showing

3367
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:29,199
yeah so this video is just for people

3368
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:30,960
who are coming from the active inference

3369
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,560
lab but want to see like a robot

3370
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,480
actually move we have been talking about

3371
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,560
robots moving so if we play the video

3372
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,440
it's just an introduction to turtlebot

3373
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:42,000
and how people use it in an experimental

3374
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,520
setting so

3375
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,719
so yeah

3376
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:46,400
the first

3377
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,560
few seconds of the video will describe

3378
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,880
all there is

3379
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,320
awesome um well

3380
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,679
we leave a blank slide for the

3381
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:56,719
discussion

3382
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,000
sections this was um an awesome and

3383
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
memorable discussion and it's just the

3384
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,159
opening of the 42 when we'll continue on

3385
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:11,280
in a participatory group setting in the

3386
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:14,320
coming two weeks and hopefully have

3387
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,239
any of the authors join anyone else who

3388
02:05:16,239 --> 02:05:18,480
would like to join in

3389
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:21,520
uh i'll let you give a penultimate

3390
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,520
thought but just really appreciate the

3391
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,960
the care that you brought to these

3392
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,079
slides into this stream

3393
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,679
yeah and thanks to stephen and everyone

3394
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:34,800
else who asked questions

3395
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,040
yeah okay so if you have anything else

3396
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:41,040
you want to add otherwise we can just uh

3397
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:43,599
thank the listeners and head out

3398
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:46,159
yeah i mean this was my first active

3399
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,159
inference

3400
02:05:48,159 --> 02:05:49,280
appearance

3401
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,440
in

3402
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,159
in the sequence of hopefully a lot of

3403
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:55,679
appearances in the future and this

3404
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:57,679
clarified a lot of concepts for me as

3405
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,599
well and connected it to one of the

3406
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,639
fields that i was very intimately

3407
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,119
connected with uh almost a decade back

3408
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:05,920
so

3409
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:08,800
so yeah happy to see connections being

3410
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,520
reforged and

3411
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,760
yeah looking forward to meet with the

3412
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,440
authors

3413
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:16,880
okay

3414
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,880
thanks a lot sid thanks everybody and

3415
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,280
see you next week bye

3416
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:24,519
thank you

3417
