"Unknown","00;00;27;27","00;00;58;10","Right. Hello and welcome everyone. It's April 27th, 20, 22 and we're in Acton five Livestream number 42.2. Welcome to the Acton Flat. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll follow good video etiquette for live streams."
"Unknown","00;00;59;14","00;01;41;10","Check our active inference dot org to learn more about what's happening in the lab. All right. Well, here we are in 42.2. We're in our third discussion around the paper robot navigation as hierarchical active inference by the authors listed here. And this is a discussion where we're going to pick up on a few different threads that were arising in the DART one and have a lot of time to explore some of the Formalisms and the robotics aspects of the project and take any questions that people are bringing up and just randomly posting in the live chat."
"Unknown","00;01;42;08","00;02;10;24","So we'll just start with introductions and saying hello and then we'll jump to where we were leaving for last time or leaving for this time from last time, and then just see where we go. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and I'll pass to Blue I'm Blue, I'm a researcher in New Mexico, and I will pass it to Tim I'm 31 recent recruiting goals Belgium reporters for the paper."
"Unknown","00;02;10;24","00;02;45;20","So feel free to ask me anything wow 33 researchers walk into a dot to do you have that kind of joke over there Jim like OK we'll go with you OK we had a few different notes down so anyone who wants to pick one of these threads up or we can return to some of the formalisms and questions about the robotics, but we're just going to pick up a thread and start with whoever wants to go first."
"Unknown","00;02;46;02","00;03;30;04","So we mentioned difference, different detail and implementation and just like fun stories or things that happened in the implementation, the idea of different types of maps. And where does emergence fit into this you will be one thing like I could elaborate on this basically from the last scream. I think Blue brought up the idea of when you enter a hotel room, everything kind of looks familiar."
"Unknown","00;03;30;04","00;04;01;16","Rather, you might have never entered that particular facility. Right? And the question was, how could this arise from from the standard model? Because here it's still kind of very tightly coupled to whatever you're observing in this particular environment. And it doesn't really seem to scale to some something else, which is which is sort as support for this kind of understanding."
"Unknown","00;04;01;16","00;04;39;29","I think you you'll need to build a system that goes even higher in hierarchy and higher in abstraction levels. And I've been thinking about this kind of emergence slash kind of models that could give this kind of behavior. And I think at some point you'll need to have a model that is complete with reasoning and abstract concepts rather than observations that that you can observe in your sensory streams."
"Unknown","00;04;41;08","00;05;42;26","So I could imagine that you that you're building a layer on top of this model. So here you basically go from camera inputs to graph based representation of your environments. I could imagine that you would need this for many different kinds of environments, which results, which yields you a number of graphs that map through that particular environment and that at that point you start kind of looking for patterns in this repertoire or graphs that you that you visited in the past and you start figuring out structure in these groups like bedrooms all have like the beds and maybe a closet, various kitchens."
"Unknown","00;05;42;26","00;06;12;22","You also have a fridge and the sink and you kind of see these kind of repeating things in certain graphs. And at this level, you kind of make a model that classifies kind of each type of environment into such a category which will then inform you or kind of give you a primer on what kind of growth you expect in the hotel room."
"Unknown","00;06;12;22","00;06;55;12","For example, I realize that I'm talking in very vague and abstract ideas here and because you don't have it, but I think that's kind of the way how to how it could be done. And I do pretty much for to to directly head into this research direction as well in particular. So if we would think about how would I implement this, then I would start with first applying the current system of the bunch of environments that have like like two different categories."
"Unknown","00;06;55;12","00;07;56;27","For example, so and then kind of learn the mobile on these structures and in particular these this current evolutions in growth neural nets might, might be an interesting to dig to see that you learn representations of growth or part of the growth and like build the latent codes that that generates similar style growth basically. And then you can kind of navigates through real environments then learn a model that the builds similar across and then use that model to kind of imagine potentially similar looking environments but still this will be so if if we implement it purely on this level, I imagine it will still be very much tied to observation level."
"Unknown","00;07;56;27","00;08;55;03","Like you could generate potential frames that's going to look like it's, it's like creating a generic model on this un that data set so you can kind of generate novel kind of bedrooms, but it's still very much like two pixel level versus I think to go to our marks state and human level reasoning like we do that at some point you have to start to have more understanding carving up the observation space and through different kind of objects and the these kind of representations which are totally not in the current model and yeah, you'll, you'll need to have some understanding of this level before, before you can have reasoning like okay, I go through a"
"Unknown","00;08;55;03","00;09;02;04","hotel room and I expect to find a TV and a remote control for this video."
"Unknown","00;09;06;05","00;09;47;07","Yes, blue thanks. That's super interesting and kind of a good maybe tie end to like I was also thinking about different kinds of maps more than just over some kind of spatial scenario. And, and the the one obvious idea that comes to mind is like a semantic map over language in natural language processing and using this kind of hotel room scenario as a topic like in the topic of politics, you expect to find right wing, left wing conservative, liberal like you expect to find all of these words in the topic of politics."
"Unknown","00;09;47;07","00;10;10;16","If you're trying to model the topic. And I just wonder what other if either of you guys have ever thought about other kinds of spaces that can be mapped over like this like physical space, semantic space, where else can we build maps where we can kind of implement this type of navigation? Yeah, I mean, that's that's a very interesting question."
"Unknown","00;10;10;16","00;11;06;03","And actually, I think one of the core hypotheses that Adam and I are investigating is basically that anything that is related to through our cognition is it basically stems from building the kind of map and then navigating it and how this could be more concrete space for different kinds of maps. Of course, this is a huge, huge effort and you need to have like experts on a certain domain in order to kind of think about is this possible and how could it be and for some topics, it's pretty obvious like like navigation, for instance, and the semantic modeling that you mentioned."
"Unknown","00;11;06;03","00;11;41;15","But I think it's also intuitive. It relates to how you can build a map from this and related. There's also the the word from from James Whittington on the Borman Eichenbaum machine that's that goes in a similar direction where he basically builds a system that's also true navigating a structure, tries to infer certain relationships. And he also applies the same model on different kinds of tasks."
"Unknown","00;11;41;20","00;12;06;14","So, for example, one task is also navigation, but like navigation. And in the world like you could you go north, east, west south and then you expect to be in the same location again. But you can also be also applied like on some of the trees like John is the father of Daniel and Daniel is brother of blue."
"Unknown","00;12;06;23","00;12;46;14","Then you could infer who is a sister or Daniel, for example. And you also maps this in like navigating the space and learning how how relationships which which are done, like taking actions in the map. It's like all in the brother area. It's like it's taken an action in in the physical map, let's say. And then you basically have to traverse through the family tree only once, but then you know, all the relationships, then you can start navigating and make this kind of inference."
"Unknown","00;12;46;22","00;13;24;08","This is actually pretty cool work and there was another I think there was a little task we also played on. So there are some tasks or it's really obvious how to do it there are plenty of others where it's not so obvious, but yeah, some somewhere. Adam and I basically think, yeah, this is kind of anything should be mapped through the system and this could then be like a universal way of, of how how did humans come to thinking in these kind of abstract levels?"
"Unknown","00;13;24;19","00;13;50;11","Well, basically because they evolved from the very good mapping and navigation system. That's kind of the, the main idea. So if you so how to build a map and then navigate its first on the navigation level and then on the more abstract level, then we might be on the way to, to do like kind of a general system for, for, for a reason."
"Unknown","00;13;50;13","00;14;20;05","It's yes. Hello. Thank you. Thanks. That was super helpful. So I really yeah, that opened up a lot of doors. So in relationships to another project that Daniel and I are working on, it seems like from the family tree, then it would be easy to map over like a genetic space, a genomic space, or even like a file of genetic space from one species to the next, or even like mapping over recipes like when you're cooking or even like different types of art."
"Unknown","00;14;20;25","00;14;28;23","So just kind of anywhere where there's the adjacent possible, it seems like that that's where you can construct these kinds of maps. That's really neat."
"Unknown","00;14;31;19","00;15;09;11","Yeah. I think the Oh, good yeah. I think the, the main thing is how, how do you transfer the action concepts through through the space that you're looking at? Like in a family tree, action is like moving from one person to the other and the action site basically defines the relationship between two persons. I think that's kind of the, the difficult part or always like which is the action space that you need to traverse the roles."
"Unknown","00;15;09;23","00;15;39;07","And then the second thing is like what are the, what are the locations in the world? And once you can map this through, then I think you're pretty pretty much done it's like it's finding a way of moving from one location through another, these actions. And if you have the actions or relations between these you can basically draw an inference on what is now the relation between A and B, given this structure awesome."
"Unknown","00;15;40;05","00;16;20;05","A few points. So Tim, thanks for beginning with this nice description. About how we could add in this conceptual or cultural layer and about generalizing across different environments. And that reminded me of the work on pattern languages. And it's kind of a bottom up discovery. And then it was a great point. Like, yes, there's the algorithms that generate a house scene, but there might be something that at a pixel level makes sense, like putting a toothbrush under a cabinet, but then semantically or culturally a person will look at that."
"Unknown","00;16;20;05","00;16;43;14","It's like, but that doesn't make sense. And so then that would be like, let's just say it explored a bunch of different warehouses and the commonality was like it was always rectilinear shelving. There's a genre of warehouse that's like always that way. And then whether it was like three shelves by ten shelves or the other way around, there would be like another space that those graphs would not too."
"Unknown","00;16;43;14","00;17;11;27","So that was a very nice piece. And then Chris Fields and Michael Levin just a few days ago wrote this paper, Competency in Navigating Arbitrary Space Intelligence as an invariant for analyzing cognition in diverse embodiments. So perhaps something relevant for us to explore going forward. What do you think, blue? I think these guys write papers like faster than I can read papers, which is amazing."
"Unknown","00;17;12;14","00;17;42;28","I know it was yeah. April 24th. So three days ago. I have not fully read it, but, but a lot of the figures looked very interesting and so and then but I want to continue on this last point about the actions in maps because that kind of mapping and multi scale mapping and transmitting and translating across different types of maps is kind of the what the multi-level slam is."
"Unknown","00;17;42;28","00;18;05;19","It's what a single level slam is. But then the compose ability of this discussion is what enables like there to be a slam where it goes from a geometric space to a top logical space and then from that into like a cultural or narrative space or something. So how does action relate to maps? And I thought about that family tree."
"Unknown","00;18;05;19","00;18;38;21","You mentioned how there was one representation where the actions were like just like, well, you know, if you were in a room shaped like a bifurcating tree, then the actions would be you walking around that room. So that's one action. Then there's the cognitive action as that entity is building its knowledge representation of the tree and that that is related to its planning and its preferences or all of this that isn't it inferring the tree, but it's like figuring out how it's going to infer the tree."
"Unknown","00;18;39;07","00;19;14;08","And then there's like there's other actions though. There's the action though we won't talk about it, of how families arise. There's all kinds of actions and the tree is just a representation of some other process. So how do we think about all these ways that action relates to maps and what kind of maps are actionable what about ones that are about action but not actionable or all this other possibilities yeah."
"Unknown","00;19;15;00","00;20;17;15","I'm not sure whether I'm all the way with you with your with your last explanation. So I think that's the second bullet. Like the action of dating model. I would not necessarily consider that an action. I think that the dating of the model just arises from from experience and trying to minimize the free energy. Anyhow, the the action from from the, the other actions I think is like what is the action concept on different levels for example, in be more concrete in the in the model, we had the low level action, which is basically the velocity commands for the robot's like move or, or, or turn around to this kind of little step."
"Unknown","00;20;18;06","00;20;43;04","But then the higher level action goals, that would be the goal that the move which is like traversing the space from one location to another, which is kind of in this case a course grading of the lower level action. But I think for every level in your abstraction hierarchy, there will be an action concept that moves from one thing to another."
"Unknown","00;20;45;03","00;21;15;06","And what that concept has to be will be staged to whatever level of direction you're modeling of at that stage, I guess. But I don't see any other actions besides that or seeing thank you live. So I think about like at different levels of actions. If, if you, for example, think about foraging and so you can have like camps of human foragers and the task of each individual forager is to go out and find food."
"Unknown","00;21;15;13","00;21;41;27","So you go out, you find food and you come back and you go out and you find food and you come back. And then like if it takes too long to find the food, then collectively as a unit, the camp decides to move, right? So so you pick up and you make camp somewhere else. So that's like an example of like every day the individual unit does something, some task, and then the collective makes a decision based on the, on the input of the individual foragers or like the time it takes them to find food."
"Unknown","00;21;42;07","00;22;10;24","So that's kind of a way that I can think about the nesting of, of action yeah. And so, so, so, so I think we're on the same page on vertical because you will have at some point the very high level model that the Golden State like do we have enough foods? If not we collect, if we don't find foods we go to in our state."
"Unknown","00;22;10;24","00;22;47;01","So it could be like a very high level abstract map with a few states and nodes and you could drop a imagine you can draw out like the graph but nodes for every node is specific states and then doing an action brings you from one note to the other. It could be a note like nodding off foods, foods move to another location and then you go from another foods to foraging, which brings you either to which either brings you in the same state or brings to the state they have enough food, which is fine."
"Unknown","00;22;47;11","00;23;29;25","And if you keep on residing in the not in a food state, then you decide to move and you might so so so you could go to imagine an abstract map where you have this kind of dynamics and the actions make sense. And then at some point you will have the the task or the action in this level that this search for food, which at some level down the road will will be driving actions for start walking or navigating or search for places that the does that are promising for finding lots of levels of, of, of conceptual hierarchy."
"Unknown","00;23;29;25","00;23;53;04","You will have different actions that bring you from one to the other where the nodes might be like a general state of the community, which is like the very top level that you just described. And then you also have like nodes that are like physical locations in your environment. And then you also have like very low level nodes that might describe like your current both in the world basically."
"Unknown","00;23;53;04","00;24;16;19","And the lowest level action will just be the the thoughts that you do or the missile, the missile movement that you do a lot with your legs and your hands. It would be the very low level. So I think you can you can draw the skills of all the way up and down with the many layers of the hierarchy and each layer going from one state to another."
"Unknown","00;24;17;07","00;24;42;03","This is basically the edit layer, but the meaning will be different depending on which level you are and the more the difficult path I think is how how could you how can you have these concepts emerge from from from bottom up? And I'm not sure whether it's possible, but we are trying to get as high up as we can."
"Unknown","00;24;42;23","00;25;15;19","This very interesting guest. Thank you. Blue so it's super interesting and definitely it's why I link next to semantic space because when you're trying to communicate with someone like the purpose of communicating can be, you know, have many faces. But, but in, in communication it's like reaching a shared understanding and then like OK, we have enough understanding of that topic."
"Unknown","00;25;15;19","00;25;40;17","Like let's move on to another topic in a, in a conversation. And so that's why that's like very easily it's very easy for me to see like how the semantic mapping and the spatial mapping can can link together. But I can't think of like why I mean, like what? Why would people like well, maybe in genetic or genomic maps that also make sense right?"
"Unknown","00;25;40;17","00;26;13;15","Like to like like what would be the action like to evolve I guess is the action in kind of a genomic map space. But like I guess maybe novelty and that's kind of where active inference comes in. Like why would you traverse a map of recipes or a map of different types of art? And I guess like the idea is in an exploration like in it and trying like, well, what happens if I combine these ingredients in this other way or this other ingredients or like where is the adjacent possible?"
"Unknown","00;26;13;15","00;27;00;23","Like, that's where I kind of think that the exploration, the room for exploration comes in. And so when you when you traverse a map, sometimes the action is just to to see what's next or just to to explore or reduce uncertainty about about your possibilities or affordances yeah. So I think once you once you've nailed down the different this thing of states and what are the different actions you can take that bring you from one state to another on a certain level then basically the the what you will do can emerge just from, from minimizing the energy right and that this would be the, the, the, the bar for the key reasons or the powerful"
"Unknown","00;27;02;04","00;27;27;11","tool that active interest gives you is that once you, you I would see building a map and or like more that kind of graph structure where you connect nodes and the transition between nodes or then the actions, that's kind of the way to build a model that is a bit more complex than well X is not that more complex."
"Unknown","00;27;27;11","00;27;38;06","But then then the traditional A and B matrices and then that really you can apply the same principles, right?"
"Unknown","00;27;45;00","00;28;23;08","Let me write this one very important point down term because you said and maybe you could just unpack this in active inference, being able to provide a structure of the model provides us a way to optimize it using variational Bayesian methods message passing software toolkits like for any lab active lock for Inspire, MDP MATLAB, SPM, and I think that's something that's subtle but interesting and different from a lot of other models where the mere data structure doesn't lend itself to like an implementable algorithm."
"Unknown","00;28;24;01","00;28;25;03","What do you think about that?"
"Unknown","00;28;28;03","00;29;04;10","Yeah, I think that's very true. And I think one of the one of the important things also in the, in the whole slam system view is that we basically move from more or less high dimensional continuous observation and action space. I mean, you could you could do any continuous you can command any, any number of philosophy that a sensible thing to robot and the the amount of pixels information that you can get is also very big."
"Unknown","00;29;04;16","00;29;55;13","It's not close to infinite. So we basically move from this high dimensional continuous basis to something that is more like a discrete set of nodes that you can traverse, which is much more like than an in a matrix like, like we are used to. And so just by enforcing the model to learn from this more discrete state space that we can manage is already a big step that's that would allow for an extra or active inference to do to be applied basically because one of the biggest issue is always like, OK, you could use active inference for planning, but if your state space is so large, then you just you cannot just iterate over all"
"Unknown","00;29;55;19","00;30;25;13","potential policies and go to the next tree energy and pick the best one because your space just blows up. But if you are able to at some level this precise, it's through a limited set of states that are applicable to your current context, then maybe you can start iterating through all the potential relevant behaviors. It's like going back through the to the foraging example."
"Unknown","00;30;25;13","00;31;00;23","If you just have to choose between moving versus foraging, the problem becomes much more easy then when you have to decide for any possible missile movement that you can do the next few hours. Right. So I think moving to a more discreet set of states is is crucial to to scale these methods to to the realistic settings awesome."
"Unknown","00;31;01;18","00;31;28;23","So returning to this Maps of actions question, and that's a little bit in contrast with like the maps of meaning and I think it points again to active inference as always having inference in action as like two approaches to minimize free energy, two ways to think about the same process I want to return to this question about like what the actions and the moves are."
"Unknown","00;31;29;09","00;32;04;16","So I'm imagining a blue on the foraging trip. And there's what was the the semantics of the slam presented in this paper was it was a location based approach, whether in a geometric space or in a, you know, topological in a relational space. But am I in the right position like is a question about location satisfies thing. And then it can also be thought of as like that entity is existing at a location in cognitive parameter space."
"Unknown","00;32;04;16","00;32;33;22","Because this question about estimate about space is a cognitive parameter. It's one about the territory. It's a map of the territory. But these are cognitive parameters that can include like am I paying it? Am I where I want to be with respect to how I'm paying attention about things? And so to actually explore that, I wanted to juxtapose two different generative models that we've seen."
"Unknown","00;32;34;08","00;33;03;07","And keeping in mind also that that capacity of active inference where being able to form these generative models it also is helping us get towards applying them. So on the right is the structure of the model from your paper on the left is a three level model, but there's also a two level one that I can pull up and it's from the Sanford Smith at all paper on computational phenomenology and mental action."
"Unknown","00;33;04;06","00;33;33;14","And so the actions in this case are happening at the level of what am I perceiving, what what is the action of this sort of like motor level? And whereas in your multi-level slam, this level was about space still again from the geometric, smaller scale tactical scale of space to the top logical, bigger scale strategic level of space, but it's still about the territory."
"Unknown","00;33;34;04","00;34;24;19","And in here a somewhat analogous multi scale nesting of the partially observable Markov decision process is used to represent not a spatial layer or a core screening, but actually in attentional layer. So what do you think this what does this make you think of or what does nesting plumps mean and what could it mean well, in essence, what it what it basically does, it puts the higher level with like a fire on your lower level right on the of the next."
"Unknown","00;34;24;19","00;34;59;26","So in my figure, like the one if you have if you have a belief over your states in the red box, then basically this gives you a primer on what you expect to observe in in a single blue box and in this case, in my case, it's very tied to the spatial domain, but in essence, it doesn't give you a prior on, on, on, on any aspects of, of the level below."
"Unknown","00;34;59;26","00;35;33;02","Right. And I think that's what they do on the of those in the left model that also if you have like an inference of if you have a belief on the Orange States in the left middle, it basically gives you a primer on what what states you expect to observe or to believe in in the blue over here's going to be I think this is figure 12 instead of figure five."
"Unknown","00;35;34;09","00;36;09;00","So this is the generalized deep model of action and here the emissions of the hidden state at the higher internal mental level cognitive domain the emission mediated by the a matrix just like it would be in a retina but the emission of a is the hidden state at the lower level S one but also the uncertainty parameters like the variance estimates on every other core kernel parameter."
"Unknown","00;36;09;00","00;36;47;12","So yeah so in the slide of what other which are these other generalized connections do you think have relevance for the robotic slam context I think I think it makes a lot of sense to also have like something modulating your, your, your precision parameters. It's, it's like it's like having a certain trust on your observations for certain environments."
"Unknown","00;36;47;12","00;37;20;28","For example, you could you could you could, for example, if you go, if you go through your cellar, you might know that the lighting conditions will not be optimal and you'll have different precision than when you're in your kitchen, for example, just thinking out loud. So I think it makes sense to, to have this hierarchical structure on any phone or anything that that you have beliefs over or anything that's can have importance on on your own."
"Unknown","00;37;21;05","00;38;23;03","Making better predictions basically. So you can have this, you can you can have better predictions if you have a good idea on how precise you would expect your observations to be. So that's why it makes sense to have a model evolve that's that's fixed isn't through a council. I guess it just is very interesting. Like if the nesting can represent staying within the same domain and of course screening of like OK, you know district states continent like a sort of within the same genre but different core screenings or it can seemingly at least in the case of mental action and hyper prior optimization modeling in general like investigation and research in general those cases, this"
"Unknown","00;38;23;03","00;39;02;04","is not a core screening. It's something totally different. So if the interface can mean two totally different things, couldn't it could there be a third implication to or do these exhaust the implications of nesting can nesting only refer to like a like kind nesting, for example, nested time scales, nested spatial scales or the cognitive action of basically removing something from the sensory territorial domain and then like entering it once into the cognitive domain."
"Unknown","00;39;02;22","00;39;41;11","But then once it's been entered into so-called hidden internal states, which are not even being proposed to actually exist in space or time, then you're kind of in in like the matrix slash simulation slash structure learning on cognitive models and then it's not like that's going to be nested. I don't know but I think it's just the, in the end it's, it's just finding the finding the most simpler model that explains it's not simpler."
"Unknown","00;39;41;11","00;40;20;14","Right. And you could imagine a model that that operates on the lowest level always and that it needs just has the case of a robot has pixel inputs and has to work or it's the output and builds a model that can predict for hours in the future accurately. But then you also realize that this should be a very very very complex model it must all it's almost the environment."
"Unknown","00;40;20;14","00;41;01;28","Right. And this is intelligible. I mean, the only way to kind of do it then is to just start adding structure to the model and starts secularizing all different variables. And in essence, this thing is nothing else but secularizing a certain variable. So so I think in the end it's just a matter of finding the model that's most accurately predict what's going to happen within this complexity and building in a hierarchical nested model is one way to to to make this happen."
"Unknown","00;41;07;00","00;41;32;02","The way the blue spoke about the genetic nesting in the sort of Aristotelian sense giving rise to in the genetic sense and in the sort of cellular and then how you framed it as the simplest model but not any simpler, which is often, at least in the Bayesian area, framed as being like the AIC or by C Preto optimal model, or some kind of a tradeoff of accuracy and complexity, so on."
"Unknown","00;41;32;21","00;42;05;18","And it's like there's a process of structure learning because we want to know, OK, categorically, should we be setting a one level two level model what kind of structure within the three level nesting, which one of these edges are going to be making? The machine learning model in real life run 100 times slower and not even converge. Which one of these edges are we going to be just totally in the dark without basing model selection on structures including cognitive structures and those structures."
"Unknown","00;42;05;18","00;42;36;29","We're not picking the final best. This structure learning is not picking the final best parameter zation and this is kind of like how Carl is always speaking about developmental robots and how out of the factory or whatever it's going to be in a learning mode. So the structure learning is on learning structures and the learning structures are about perception including the actions that one is observing themself to be doing."
"Unknown","00;42;37;10","00;43;08;12","Because if we couldn't observe the consequences, or at least even our own action states in some way, there'd be like a total disconnect and our we could never get our action policies. It would just be like the motor babbling and the sort of uncoordinated movement. And I'm sure a lot of robotics and evolutionary simulators like that's why they have that wobbly leg face because I think a lot of those models, they don't know they're wobbling, they're just implementing like in this super high dimensional space of motor policies."
"Unknown","00;43;08;12","00;43;39;28","They're just they're not getting the feedback so this is it is like a nesting cool, very interesting direction here. And I think there's a lot more to explore about what kinds of testings because maybe it's actually that attentional layer that you described in your opening thoughts about the higher level of abstraction that was taking in a graphical graph."
"Unknown","00;43;40;24","00;44;32;20","I mean, you know, maybe that is the layer that just comes on top right here. And the current the can gets input into some other thing let's look at some of the formalisms and figures or if blue or if anyone in the lab has any questions they can totally ask I have a question on this or if there's another equation or formalism that it's clear to address this question and this P on the left side, you can describe it in your own words, but it's a joint distribution of multiple variables."
"Unknown","00;44;33;11","00;44;58;24","How does one go from knowing what variables they want to include in the joint distribution, like what arguments they want that function to take and then a specific partitioning factorization, like, is this the only factorization? Or How do we make this factorization and based upon what we kind of know what we want to model, maybe even very early."
"Unknown","00;45;00;26","00;45;39;22","Yeah. So so basically going from the left hand side to the right hand side, you can basically one on one derived from the figure basically. So if you look at the figure, you see that the left by has no incoming arrows. So there will be no conditioning on on both. And then if you look at the action notes, then you see that these all get that input arrow from BI."
"Unknown","00;45;39;22","00;46;07;19","So then you know that by actually influencing the action that you do, so this will be a probability of action given by. And so that's basically how you could you can write down the immigration just by looking at the figure we see. So typically how we if we if we start off with a new with a new type of model, we start off indeed with just listing all the variables that build the model."
"Unknown","00;46;08;10","00;46;44;01","And then we start with drawing the potential diagram like we have on the right and try to make sense of that. And once we have that, the equation just pulls out basically. And it's always a matter of thinking like which variable has influence on which other ones, for instance, you can also make make your own assumptions there. Like one of the assumptions that we often make is like the hidden states should be kind of could be Markov over here."
"Unknown","00;46;44;11","00;47;21;07","So once we know the state that we don't need any information on the boss anymore to generate the current observations, for example. So, so these kind of assumptions go also in and they will then decide on, on which things you need to condition because we would also if in general you have the joint distribution, you can also just restrict yourselves to the basically base rule to come up with the factorization."
"Unknown","00;47;21;07","00;47;57;17","So this could be done five times of a given by time as given and by times you've both given us a five. So you can just use base rule. You could also come up with the fact that will be perfectly valid, but that might not be easy to implement. So you basically search a bit for what is possible and you add some assumptions in order to make it work intuitively as well as practically if that makes sense."
"Unknown","00;47;59;19","00;48;24;14","Thanks a lot. So you mentioned the first two terms here. It would just be great to hear for the green, blue and the purple term. Just how do you describe the way that you look at the graph and then translated it here? And then I'll have another question. But first up. Yeah, so green, blue, purple, yeah. So for the green one, you look at the initial notes of the blue bar."
"Unknown","00;48;24;18","00;48;59;11","So this it's like your initial your initial state at the start of sequence and you can and this one is this one has now. Oh, yes or no. This will be the yes. So this will be the ultimate original state that you were. I don't think that I don't think that's the the equation on the left corresponds to the do the figure because there is no locations and moves in there right."
"Unknown","00;48;59;12","00;49;07;28","OK, yes. This is a lower level model that we're looking at. Yeah. Yes. OK, the initial condition is conditionally independent of other edges. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;49;09;28","00;49;31;28","Yeah. And that so so the green and the blue is basically your initial start state. So you, you you have to bootstrap somewhere. So you have some prior on your starting state. And then from then on, the next state still all on the actions you take. So then it's in the, in the first the first term is basically saying OK, my next stage will depend on my previous state and the action I took."
"Unknown","00;49;32;15","00;50;04;05","And then the, the second one in the purple is the action that I take will depend on my policy and the last terms and just says, OK, by current observation, it only depends on maker and state because I assume that all information of the time is basically is represented in the, in the state of the thing this is really powerful."
"Unknown","00;50;04;05","00;50;43;28","And I think that the fact that all future states are part of a combinatorics relationship with action, it really shows how deeply action is embedded within active inference. Like there simply is not a consideration of future observations or latent states except for conditioning action on policy and conditioning states on action. So policy is above actions that are selected that are actually taken and enacted, but all inference is conditioned on action selection, which is conditioned on policy."
"Unknown","00;50;44;18","00;51;16;00","And there are two separate models like an expectation module and then like an action selection state value mapping, state policy mapping policy statement, all those kinds of constructs that are meant to bridge the gap between inference and action being two sides of the same coin to minimize free energy, literally. Also for those machine learning models, it's just really interesting how that is all concisely simplified and integrated in active inference."
"Unknown","00;51;16;13","00;51;44;26","And so I want to ask a question on this purple term, which is, is anything known about the computational complexity of changing H with respect to how you actually ran the models like sort of in principle or how you actually ran it? Like is it like if you go like one, two, three, four or five times steps, does it go like times up squared or is it like time steps, triple squared or what is it?"
"Unknown","00;51;46;02","00;52;21;16","Yeah. So I think you have to distinguish through the difference differences sphere so when when just modeling that system, the age doesn't really matter. It's just it's good to go through the minutes with it without, without lots of generalizations. It's like your, your agent gets bored and then it operates like this until the end of its life and it could be so from, from just modeling the system, it doesn't really matter and just say, OK, this is the, the, the time horizon."
"Unknown","00;52;21;16","00;53;02;01","They consider the system and this is then how I assume it's, it's, it's basically it's a different story. If we look at the actual implementation where you suddenly have to get to an age yeah. If I implement this model, how long do I means how long do I want this thing to be able to predict? Because of course if you if you build a model that is predicting and then you have to check whether your prediction was correct and you use the kind of models that we use it basically want to back propagate all the way back through."
"Unknown","00;53;03;15","00;53;36;27","You have a gradient of data. Then of course the edge becomes determined by practical considerations like how much memory does my machine have to keep all these intermediate states of memory and I can still back propagate through through this model. So, so, so that is basically an implementation. Implementation driven the choice on how far in the future do you want to model this thing or can you model this thing?"
"Unknown","00;53;36;27","00;54;01;29","Because it might also be that if you try to predict too far ahead that there's so much noise that it doesn't even make sense to try to predict the future. So it can be it can be driven either by what makes sense for these environments versus how much how much compute and memory do I have to make this happen?"
"Unknown","00;54;02;00","00;54;09;05","This awesome balloons. You want to. Yes, go for it."
"Unknown","00;54;11;07","00;54;38;21","So I have a question over this figure and then also over the its formalism six. I don't know if you have that anywhere. In the slides, Daniel, if you want to grab it. Yep. OK, so in formalism six like the same observations are there at both levels at the lower level and the higher level. And this makes a lot of sense for something like foraging, right?"
"Unknown","00;54;38;21","00;55;01;10","Like the, the lower level, the group is at the individual is going to go out, move, forage, and then at the higher level it's going to the group is going to move. Right? So in a hierarchical sense, that makes sense. And then in figure two, in the end, the legend of the figure, it says that the higher level operates on a coarser time scale."
"Unknown","00;55;01;23","00;55;25;29","So where like the, the lower level decisions are made at, you know, 15 minute time scales or one hour time scales, the higher level is like a day or something of some similar relationship. And that also would make sense for something like like foraging. This is kind of relates back to the question of emergence. And I just wonder if you can allow for so like not all systems operate this way."
"Unknown","00;55;25;29","00;55;47;12","And, you know, here's that the big, big question, right? Like, like every like organ in my body does something different, right? Like so and then like, you know, all of my cells are getting dehydrated and then suddenly, like I say, I'm thirsty and I drink, right? It's not like my cells cannot like move to go like take a drink of water."
"Unknown","00;55;47;28","00;56;09;27","So like in a hierarchical sense where the higher level is doing a different action than the lower level. Have you thought at all about how to try to navigate something like this, like where at the higher level that the action is totally different? Well, the timescale might be coarser, but but here the variables change. And this is something I think about a lot."
"Unknown","00;56;09;27","00;56;41;15","And so I'm always collecting input. And I just wonder what you think. Tim, Yeah. So so basically the the I guess the core question is how if you take a decision at the higher level, which is like the move in this case, how does it triple down to the lower level action that might even be related to the the move you want to make it at the higher level or something like that?"
"Unknown","00;56;41;15","00;56;41;23","Right."
"Unknown","00;56;43;27","00;57;21;17","So basically what how this happens is that if you if you look at a single level, so like a vanilla active inference formulation, then at some point you design the preferences from from a prior it's like these are my preferences. So that's what I want to obtain in in this one level and in the hierarchical model, how we do it is a basically the, the, the action on the higher level."
"Unknown","00;57;21;17","00;57;26;05","So in this case, making a move to another location, it basically sets."
"Unknown","00;57;28;07","00;58;11;22","So so if we if we do you have a bigger version of the of the of the image, maybe the so suppose that we go from so we are now at oh big deal and we want to make the move to our big plus one. So this basically so at some point this is the decision we took we want to go through the to the other one then basically we can use then the the eight matrix or the the liquid model that then says OK, if I add how deep this one, then this is the kind of state and both that I expect."
"Unknown","00;58;12;14","00;58;36;26","So this is then being fed back downwards this like this is now the reference for the lower level model to obtain this kind of state. And then at the low at the lower level, you again have your expected free energy to work out the low level, both your actions that actually bring you closer to that kind of preference."
"Unknown","00;58;38;03","00;59;03;05","But at the same time, so at each actual fine, great step, you get lower level observations that then give you new beliefs over the state of the force. You would which might give you more, which might give you more information of the location that you're in and then either at some point you will reach the preferred location and then, OK, great success."
"Unknown","00;59;03;22","00;59;32;07","Or it might be that something went terribly wrong and you end up in a different location. But then it basically also goes up again and at a higher level you then say, OK, I'm now not at the location that you ought to be, but apparently some different ones that I was. So then you start planning again at that level to do correct and search for a new step to take that will then ripple down this like a preference for the lower level."
"Unknown","00;59;32;07","01;00;06;19","And that's how everything kind of continues ongoing. So the you have your your that you use the likelihood model that maps the states from the higher level model to a belief on lower level states. And this model becomes kind of your preference for the lower level which then as your inference process there to do in projection. And that's how you can kind of decouple them from semantic meaning as well this is awesome."
"Unknown","01;00;06;19","01;00;29;06","It reminds me of the kind of question that people often ask, where do you want to travel where would you like to travel? Where would you prefer to travel? It's often interpreted in a very life scale of analysis like I would really like to go to this other area. So then that's like, let's think about that as the biggest level."
"Unknown","01;00;29;06","01;00;51;20","So where would you like to travel? I'd like to go to California. How will you get there? I'll take a plane. Where will you go to take a plane? I'll drive to the airport how will you drive to the airport? I'll get in my car. How will you get in your car? I'll leave my room. How will you leave your room?"
"Unknown","01;00;52;00","01;01;18;25","I'll get out of my chair. Like, that's very much the nesting between the top level, having more of like this topological where I want to be, which then is imposed and propagated as and sets the constraints and opportunity for this lower level like how I will get there because it's a totally where would you like to go? Somebody could think in their head, I want to go to California in my life."
"Unknown","01;01;19;09","01;01;50;26","And then the answer to the Where do you want to travel? Would be like to the next room would be like that wasn't really the scale of the context of the question, but this really shows how the multi scale nesting of location lends itself to heretics and algorithms. That help us like chunk complex navigation tasks like navigating to somewhere in California in the next few years."
"Unknown","01;01;51;25","01;02;15;02","But you can't do the rollout for all of the actions taken at the chair level for that because it's going to be too many explosions of commentary. Tim. Yeah, and just to add into the storyline line, so at some level in the hierarchy, you you are like, okay, I want to go to my car. But then you could say, OK, but I need my car."
"Unknown","01;02;15;02","01;02;44;29","Can you say I don't know where they are or where my car can? So then suddenly from having this really goal directed this thing, at some point you say, OK, I need some more information at this level to actually reach my goal. And so at that level, it might switch to more epistemic foraging, which will then ripple down to the level below like okay, let's let's take a look in my kitchen or at the kitchen table, maybe go there."
"Unknown","01;02;45;04","01;03;11;08","And so that's how at every level of the hierarchy you have this expert Asian exploration trade off and the outcome of the inference process will then ripple down to the level below. Like this is the preference for this level of thing. And this is how everything then starts flowing this awesome blue. So I'm going to now, now ask another really hard question."
"Unknown","01;03;11;08","01;03;37;03","So, so this is really awesome. And it reminds me of like how the higher level constrains the actions at the individual level. It reminds me of and I know like you were intending to take this out of semantic space, but it puts it back into semantic space for me. I was having a conversation over the weekend in which the Complexity Weekend and one of the participants brought up a kind of political and controversial talk about the topic."
"Unknown","01;03;37;03","01;04;01;17","And I was, you know, they said so, so what do you think? And I said, I think I shouldn't talk about that. And then they said, OK, well, so what do you want to talk about? Which is like kind of like a like an odd question to have in a conversation, but it constrains like when you when you assign the topic or like here, I mean, we're obviously assigning the topic."
"Unknown","01;04;01;17","01;04;26;09","Also, we're here to talk about this paper and related things that might come up, but in like a spontaneous conversation, when you assign the topic, it very much constrains the conversation to it limits the topic or at least starts a seed and I wonder, like, why do we have to talk about anything? Like, can't we just sit or like, can't we just like, you know, talk about the first thing that comes to mind?"
"Unknown","01;04;26;09","01;04;53;24","Or can we just, like, be and be quiet? But for a lot of people, that that space is kind of awkward. And where then does emergence fit into the model this is a hard question, or can it fit into the model? Like when you know what one component of the lower level says well, maybe a little move to the right and then everybody says, okay, and they start to pull to the right and then, OK, well, maybe we'll pull to the left like so."
"Unknown","01;04;53;24","01;05;07;01","So does it. Is there room for emergent or it's always constrained by the assignment of the top level? Yeah, you spoke about the top level propagating and repelling down. So what's the other direction there?"
"Unknown","01;05;11;18","01;05;48;14","I think, but unfortunately, you need you need some preferences at the highest or any of the levels. Right? And if there is no such reference, then indeed we end up in this situation like, yeah, or what happens now? And there is no really constraint, then anything can happen. But I think typically in life we're in the at some level we will always have the preference and that's that defines our, our behavior."
"Unknown","01;05;49;07","01;06;19;15","I guess I was, I was actually talking to come on similar things like as a human, we always have like we make plans or there's always something on our mind to do. And we were like, yeah, but if you look at the monkey, the zoo, you just because just sit there and do nothing. So what goes, what goes on in, in the animal's mind is like all my preferences or Mets, I'm not hungry."
"Unknown","01;06;19;23","01;06;36;20","I have a safe place. So I just do nothing. So yeah, it's an interesting question. Like what what happens if we don't have if we don't have any urgent preferences that need to be met? I don't know."
"Unknown","01;06;39;03","01;07;07;26","Well, in the zoo example, that behavior of, for example, low levels of activity might also be associated with like learned helplessness or trauma or like a freeze reaction or the the affordances are not presenting themselves in a certain way. So then that speaks like the ambiguity of cognition with respect to behavior. And like the robot could be bumping into the wall for a lot of cognitive reasons."
"Unknown","01;07;07;26","01;07;30;15","It could prefer to bump into the wall, it could prefer to do something else. And so there's like there's a many to one mapping with cognitive systems and behavior, like something to be thinking you have different reasons or preferences for why they emit a given sentence. So that's part of the complexity but also like the opportunity of the cognitive."
"Unknown","01;07;30;26","01;08;01;05","And then also the classic Lewis Carroll quote probably also misquoted slash alt quoted many other places. But it's like a great, you know, folk act in question. If you don't know where you want to go, then it doesn't matter which way you go. If you don't have high precision ish on your preferences at location, then it's a wash."
"Unknown","01;08;01;05","01;08;20;16","It doesn't matter which policy selection you're taking, because why would it the only way that you could justify is, well, I like this way, OK? Because you have a preference for simplicity where you want to head off in this direction. Those are all valid. It's not to say that if you do know where you want to go, you're right or you're doing the right thing or it's going to be easy or possible."
"Unknown","01;08;20;25","01;08;51;23","It's just like if you don't have preference, then it's not possible to make any kind of decision worth evaluating. And that also speaks to the the integration of preference in active inference as a means of guiding epistemic and pragmatic value rather than reward learning reinforcement learning, which only centers on pragmatic value. And the implicit preference is more reward would be better."
"Unknown","01;08;53;07","01;09;20;25","And then there has to be all these ad hoc ways of introducing epistemic and balancing the paperclip, maximizing into these models blue attention. So great example, Daniel and I think back to the monkey in the zoo and if the preferences are of the monkey might just be constrained by the zookeeper, like the monkey just does whatever the zookeeper wants it to do."
"Unknown","01;09;20;25","01;09;40;25","And then that made me really think about parents and children in the United States. So is there always some kind of downward causation? Right. So, so like if you have a child and in many families and not only that in the United States, but it's different culturally. Right. And so even the school system in Europe is very different than that in the United States."
"Unknown","01;09;40;25","01;09;55;19","So the kids just kind of go to some generic school. The parents may or may not have some preference for what they want the child to be. I want you to be a doctor. I want you to be a lawyer. I want you to take over the family business or whatever. And the child grows in these constraints with this predetermined idea."
"Unknown","01;09;55;19","01;10;17;29","So there's some kind of top down causation happening from parents to children, but in many Americans and like we're just floundering over here. So, so what drives then the preferences of the of the child when the when there's no downward causation? And this is kind of where exploration comes into play, right? Like so you might try this major, you might try that major, or you might do that."
"Unknown","01;10;17;29","01;10;35;11","So you might do that. And, you know, you have this this incredible amount of freedom. And so you really kind of don't go anywhere or like maybe you take one path in 25 different directions and then just end up right where you start. It's so like you just start a whole bunch of things and then don't really get down, make any progress on any one path."
"Unknown","01;10;35;20","01;10;55;08","In contrast to Europe, where I think you have to choose an eighth grade like STEM or not STEM or something like this. So, so it's interesting. So, so I think this lack of downward causation, so the emergence may this is what I'm picking up from our conversations. The emergence may come from just an exploratory and exploit way structure."
"Unknown","01;10;55;15","01;11;40;15","And like in this exploration, you just kind of find some direction through exploration then you look maybe, maybe through notes. So so one thing is if if if we don't have references, then we still have our information getting through. All right. So this might drive you to the least some some form of exploration or some drive through kind of at one point infer is as good as you can where you are or on your or on the other hand, maybe some actions will give you more and more new information to update your models, like your information getting on your mobile."
"Unknown","01;11;41;00","01;12;32;27","So this might still drive some exploratory behavior. And then how how preferences come to be shaped, I guess one relevant piece of related work is done by by no decision on on her system where it's actually all about can you learn preferences from from behavior where the idea is kind of like the things you usually do and you're happy with basically grow to be your preferences as well, and you're kind of attracted to revisit these things and this also ties in like things like just seeing your parents or having your parents taking you through some states just make it happen that these become your preferred states."
"Unknown","01;12;32;27","01;12;56;24","Also virtually the things that you just get to do because that's what people around you and you do does become your preferences because you, you're being done and you're doing it all the time. So by doing it, it's it becomes kind of your, your, your prior of things that happen and that you have to do or that you are expected to do."
"Unknown","01;12;56;24","01;13;43;08","And I just think it's, it's kind of related as well to do the work of more like how maybe the things that, that you're just also be doing and that somebody takes you to do become becomes kind of your your preferences great points. So when you said that even without preferences there's still info gain so that does hide a little preference which is a preference to resolve uncertainty but if you remove that like preference or assumption that it's kind of like, OK, there's a million ways to make your Gaussian distribution worse, you can just inflate the variance and your error will get infinitely high."
"Unknown","01;13;43;14","01;14;12;20","So putting those types of inferences away, then there's the info gain approach and then the things that reminded me of was the idea of novelty search. And so this is within the field of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation where there's often this very exacting fitness test, the top 5% fastest runners are going to survive or they're going to be evaluated on the task every single time."
"Unknown","01;14;13;07","01;14;45;08","And then people realized and thought about how, well, maybe it's not like super harsh selection. Maybe there's sort of oscillating selection pressures on the task, or maybe multiple tasks are being selected and then sort of like the ad absurdum but not say ineffective version of this argument is forget the task and the performance and the fitness on that task and either entirely or partially use novelty search and simply set select for novelty of different kinds."
"Unknown","01;14;46;01","01;15;49;02","And so it does need to make its way back to task performance like homeostasis maintenance. But this is like an interesting thread that was sort of balancing out the overly pragmatic value view. And the second thing that it reminded me of is the figure in the active inference on discrete states basis synthesis by de Costa at all 20, 20 and so here in the case of no priors on the left Bayesian surprise optimal Bayesian design, intrinsic motivation curiosity and the info max principle and so it's like interesting to see how under different special cases that are shown here no priors which might be no prior preference but let's think about that no ambiguity like no"
"Unknown","01;15;49;08","01;16;25;05","no space between the observation and the hidden state. Total observability that's the model where we were speaking about the robotics last time, like where you can just you have perfect resolution of your spatial location. Then there's no ambiguity or risk a deterministic action environments where you know exactly how well each stock is going to perform. Then you can make expected value decisions purely based around utility and then no ambiguity or priors on the right side here with maximum entropy principle and Jane's and Max."
"Unknown","01;16;25;05","01;17;15;07","And so it's like this action perception loop has so many degrees of freedom that it's just wild. And the special cases help us zoom in on like the information gathering aspect of a given level epistemic in the utility oriented components of a given level. That's the pragmatic policy and the utilitarian component. And then there's this balancing of the pragmatic and the epistemic and the ability to flex and to adapt between those, which is why some are excited about active inference as speaking to this explore exploit dialectic in a way that hasn't been approached by like we'll learn a parameter that switches between them."
"Unknown","01;17;15;16","01;17;25;17","This is like a very different way to integrate all those things by finding an action perceptual loop. That's a generalization of some of these cases."
"Unknown","01;17;31;19","01;18;10;03","And it's really interesting that this is a discrete state step space synthesis. So all but implying that there hasn't been a synthesis on continuous and hybrid state spaces so how do discrete and continuous variables come into play in just like this paper or robotics? More generally like how does that feels? Think about discrete and continuous actions yeah. So so in this paper, it's rather all it's all discrete, right?"
"Unknown","01;18;10;03","01;18;44;24","So we use this three steps we and personally we then do a lot of research on actually the continuous theme from formalism I know that, for example, the museum has done a lot of work, and my theories though were to actually do the more continuous time for control, lower level control, robotic arms and so on, and therefore it's an entirely different formalism."
"Unknown","01;18;44;24","01;19;34;08","And I'm personally not too I'm not an expert on that kind of systems, but I guess that similar ideas are there as well. On the information gained versus reference, resolving kind of planning. But the I cannot really see a lot about what is it like in this warehouse, like do people work in there or is it just a test area or what is it on the shelves yeah, it's just that this area."
"Unknown","01;19;34;14","01;20;03;14","So so basically when we when we enter that particular building, this room was allocated as we have a data center in in the building. So it's the ground floor of our building. And this room is actually allocated as as the as a part of the data center. But at the moment, we don't have we don't have enough recs to fill this, but it was like to be futureproof."
"Unknown","01;20;04;01","01;20;27;14","And so it it's just an empty space. And then people started using it this storage space for all of the things that are just lying around and nobody really has like a place for them to be. So they, they they have some recs over there with all kind of random stuff that needs to be stored somewhere like that."
"Unknown","01;20;27;29","01;21;05;16","You also have like a lot of old server cases from, from older machines over there that are just sitting there in case we, we need a spare fourth or something so it's like generic storage space and then we figured, yeah, if we have enough space anyway anyway we can start doing experiments on this. And so we have an area now where we have some robot manipulators and then at the same time we have this more kind of warehouse setup that's kind of reflects how in actual industrial warehouses they might, things might be."
"Unknown","01;21;05;29","01;21;33;14","And so we share the space with, with, with researchers working on wireless localization that then puts some beacons on and see how the wireless single propagates with all this metal shows around and these kind of things. So it's just now a generic space that you can use for experimentation on navigation, but also localization and your propagation through different kinds of materials."
"Unknown","01;21;33;15","01;22;02;20","These kind of experiments all happen, happened there. Now or the part you mentioned about the the electromagnetic radiation and how it propagates it like makes me think about how you have this current bought using only the visual light. Like we kind of talked about that previously. It could have all kinds of different sensors, but it only has the visual light and it doesn't use any kind of wi fi updating."
"Unknown","01;22;02;29","01;22;54;14","Like what if every minute, you know, it gets an update of its actual location. So that could be in the model and then different kinds of situations could be enacted, simulated and then enacted, like what happens when the lights go off? What if the wi fi goes down and then that is where the generative model being on board is really going to reveal like the robustness of the approach, because if it does have this internal spatial sense the lights going off may or going very dim, which changes the pixel values of every pixel and the ratio of the colors and like everything but maybe just the very light, you know, the exit sign, that light"
"Unknown","01;22;54;14","01;23;23;25","alone is enough for the camera to still do to relearn and just have enough input from the observation layer. So that's like very cool that you can control the space like you have policy over this space. Whereas in an operating environment that you don't control, it's like you are subject to the generative process emitting actions to you which might have regularity or favourability, but like you don't control them."
"Unknown","01;23;23;25","01;23;47;26","And that's what the lab is, is like a space where there are nest mates or robots or learners. But then the lab can also set policy with feedback from the bottom up. But also it is a place where the policy can be controlled and that can help the robot like learn and develop. So that's kind of cool. And again, it speaks to what Karl is saying about like the learning robots."
"Unknown","01;23;47;26","01;24;18;04","Like there is a time scale at which the community or the collaborators are in feedback with this niche. Like without this paper or without. Yeah, without this paper there would be the discussion. But then without this being enacted, there wouldn't be the paper. So there's a lot of interesting dynamics there yeah. Maybe to of to add on the scenario that you were describing, I'm turning over the lights and so on and using other stuff, some of those things."
"Unknown","01;24;18;13","01;24;53;27","So we actually do have experiments with this. For example, also modeling the so on this on this robot in particular at the front, you see a leaner, lighter scanner. So it just scans for the library, it measures the distances and then the resting on there is actually a radar. So that's one chirps and at 679 gigahertz chirps and then it listens for the reflecting signal."
"Unknown","01;24;54;05","01;25;32;14","And that's also a way to kind of estimate throw obstacles around through distance or day. And which are they approaching or going further from you? We actually also create models on this kind of model of these, and we could actually show that it could imagine these lighter scans inside the EHL or how our radar would evolve if the robot moving and some other things that we did, which was these things are especially awesome though the first order of this paper as well."
"Unknown","01;25;32;21","01;26;06;21","There's a lot of work on this. So so one of the things we did was if we now like a table girder in one of these scales, then when the robots would drive over it, you would see a whole different type of dynamics because it would bump up and go down and if you monitor the patient, surprise. So basically the relations between your between your dynamics model and then your posterior, you could see like a spike in kind of surprise signal on, on this kind of dynamics."
"Unknown","01;26;06;21","01;26;28;05","Like this is something weird that's happening and you could kind of use this through to see is everything going normal or is this something weird going on? Suddenly in my space, we also did this where we had the robot driving around, but also people passing by, just walking by and if that was in the distance, that's in a train on that model, it's ridiculous."
"Unknown","01;26;28;05","01;26;52;24","Not be surprised if it's if it is people passing by. And if you do that, it's like imagine how would it be if if you drive forward and sometimes you could see, of course, it's very blurry because it's like a reconstruction where you could see kind of signatures passing by as if a people was as if a person was walking past the robot like, yeah, this is a scenario."
"Unknown","01;26;52;24","01;27;04;25","This can happen it just learned it was just briefly. So that maybe discovers difference like the that is a fun fact."
"Unknown","01;27;07;02","01;27;39;27","Yeah. This is the total do do robots dream of electric sheep? Like that whole question. It's like if their generative model is generative. Sure depends on what you mean by dream. If it's only a recognition model, probably not that's very funny. Let's take just one last look. Since we talked a lot about the factorization of the one level, which was, I think, a great discussion."
"Unknown","01;27;39;28","01;28;09;16","Let's just look at the factorization of this multi scale setting and just any other things that people want to ask or any other thoughts you have. But what is happening with the factorization here? And similar to how you kind of like gave a natural language representation of the the factorization that we looked at here this is the single level just within the blue level."
"Unknown","01;28;09;16","01;28;38;11","And so what is happening with multi scale factorization? Yeah. So if you look at the, at the bottom, you basically the again the same kind of factorization as you had before, right? So it's like, OK, my good state depends on my queries, state of action and my action depends on the policy and my observation depends on my current state."
"Unknown","01;28;38;28","01;29;18;10","And the only thing that instead of here is this, this the third piece which are the poses. So it's the second term on this one and this is post. Yeah, exactly. So what we basically what we did here is like since we we are working on this navigation thing and we already had some inspiration from existing system approaches, we decided like, yeah, it actually makes a lot of sense to treat both this as kind of a first class citizen in the model."
"Unknown","01;29;18;20","01;29;42;29","And we, we really would like to have like because you kind of know how forces evolve given the action, right? Because it's pretty simple. You can have a pretty simple and transition model that says, okay, if you move forward, then your force will increase in the direction that you were heading, basically. So that's a very basic way of, of, of reading your post."
"Unknown","01;29;43;07","01;30;15;12","And your post is of course also very relevant for knowing where you are. So that's why we decided to kind of split off the, the six states and have that additional both states that was delegated for, for modeling when you are in the states like in this in this force continues the curriculum effort. And then if we go to the level above, then there you have the similar structure."
"Unknown","01;30;15;18","01;30;44;14","But now the action is the move as well. We have a prior of moves and then you move from one location to the next given the move that you're doing. And then you have like the connection between the upper level and the lower level, which is what's now the probability of having a certain lower level state. Given that I am in this location, a what would be my boss in over the robot if I'm in this location basically."
"Unknown","01;30;45;00","01;31;34;28","And that then sums it up, I guess what is the purple term and why is there the big pie at the end of it? Yeah, so the, the purple term basically is your initial your initial state or a higher level. So it's I think it's like the if you look at the blue box, it's the the gray nodes are a bit like you observe the initial observation from The New York Times that OK, cool."
"Unknown","01;31;35;11","01;32;07;25","And then and then the big BI is then from then on, you basically go for a number of like lower level steps, which is basically the the counts that you make within the blue box. So we have like this this big D and small D, which basically the or like the just the nodes step in within the, the fine grained level all the time step within the, the orange level."
"Unknown","01;32;08;05","01;32;57;17","But in an actual timing like the big D going from the big D plus one is just like the number of times steps on the actual real the score dice statuses. So suppose that we say that our sensor operates at standards like every 10 seconds you get a new observation that's like the, the lowest granularity the same thing. And then the big D just is like, you know, I'm going down step and now it could be one second later it could be 2 seconds later, could be 5 seconds later is just like going from big city to big three plus one just sits there."
"Unknown","01;32;58;04","01;33;31;13","Some time has elapsed from going through this, this, this thing that I call location through this next thing that I call location. But exactly how many actual seconds have passed? Yeah, that's the model. This because you have this system that that looks at how much surprise or how much information did did I gain from from moving. And this basically determines when you shift from one location to another."
"Unknown","01;33;31;13","01;34;01;15","So the the concept of location is based on this threshold. Then when we add a new node to the map. So we added this big the location just to introduce kind of the fine step on the higher level. But this is still the abstracted from the actual timing which you do have for the lower level. So the lower level there, the small multi is actually the rate at which your observations go basically."
"Unknown","01;34;01;15","01;34;23;03","So this is this could be fixed through like second everything that you shift. But one of the big shifts, it all depends on when you infer to be in a new location. This if that makes sense and you mentioned that there was a parameter you kind of just empirically determined when it made sense to add the new node."
"Unknown","01;34;23;22","01;35;04;22","Yeah. But then the the frequency of the discrete time steps at the bottom is 100 hertz like so 100 or ten hertz, 100 milliseconds. And that was just the sampling rate of all of these features. The that wow, there's so much happening with nesting. There's the movement from the geometric to the topological, there's the movement from something that is at a smaller finer scale to something that is enclosing it, really enclosing it, or conceptually enclosing it in this kind of way that we were talking about the cognitive domain earlier."
"Unknown","01;35;05;01","01;35;43;13","There's this movement from the Kronos to the Kairos, from the actual sensor defined speed that things are happening in the world to like the timeliness of when it's time to think that you're in a different location. And then in the biological case, it was woven so clearly to this multi scale navigational capacity of the of the E system because like if you said I'm in a different place in my room, that might be a foot, but if to be in a different place in the train might be the next train spot."
"Unknown","01;35;43;13","01;36;13;28","And so the way that language is vague yet does allow us to really drill into what model, what was valuable about that for you? What were you curious about in that moment like these kinds of ways that we interrogate ourself and that we can also engage in conversation so you have blue, why don't we sit silently maybe for, you know, performance art stream number one, it could happen."
"Unknown","01;36;14;07","01;36;47;27","But also there's uncertainty to resolve and message passing to be done. Otherwise, it's implausible that we're going to coordinate in our like actions or in our thoughts if you have any other like ideas or thoughts or questions or places you want to jump to, we can totally do so. Otherwise, this is a great thought to what are the next steps?"
"Unknown","01;36;47;27","01;37;26;19","You've mentioned several things, but just what would be like a next outcome or deliverable or thing that you're hoping to see in the near future and maybe even enact yourself yeah. Some of the things that I was discussing today with one of our students just today actually is to to basically work on them you because one of the biggest limitations now is that in order to navigate, you're basically limited to what it has seen before, right?"
"Unknown","01;37;26;19","01;38;03;05","So we still needs the we still need to have control the robots through the lab, build the map. And then only when it has the whole space, it can start it can even just then start navigating it basically so one direction is going to be kind of have the robot self navigate. And what I do there is through again, thinking through our story about preferences of different hierarchical levels, maybe we could have like a preference on the lower level that just says the day."
"Unknown","01;38;03;06","01;38;23;24","I don't want to bump into things. And, and if you don't have a map, the only thing you want is on the one hand, be curious and try to update your model as good as you can, but also not bump into things. And then you have like this robot that just started driving around at the same time building the map."
"Unknown","01;38;24;06","01;38;49;07","And then at least you can you can just put it anywhere. It will start mapping. And at some point you say, OK, to the robot now no go to no search for this particular object and then you give it the goal and it starts exploring. Maybe it can imagine, oh, this is maybe the location where I lost, saw something very similar."
"Unknown","01;38;49;07","01;39;27;29","So this is probably the location I want to go to. And then you can have it like more goal directed data. So this is something we were thinking about. And then another limitation is also that like the edges between the nodes are also only the edges that you actually traverse the ones. So for example, one, one stupid thing is that if it does not know that if, if it went from one location to the other, it can actually turn around for 60 degrees and go back to the same location because in this visual space that might be a totally different thing."
"Unknown","01;39;28;06","01;40;01;13","And if, if you never thought it or actually controlled it to turn around for 60 degrees, it will never make the link. OK, I can actually do this. So one of the things that we were exploring is like, can we use our low level judgment model to gain the imagine potential links between notes and then kind of add these links through the map as if you kind of visited those before or maybe add some weight to this link."
"Unknown","01;40;01;13","01;40;22;27","So, you know, yeah, this, this might be a link and this is the likelihood of this link but at least you can dig down this links into account planning is okay. I'm feeling adventurous, so maybe it's time to explore this link or for this particular goal, if this link exists, they never tried it, but if it's, if it exists to build that, it will be a huge shortcut to reach this goal."
"Unknown","01;40;22;27","01;40;55;02","So I really do take this gamble in this situation, observe like this kind of behaviors by, by just kind of imagining which kind of locations that I visit that maybe I never tried this before, but given the things I've learned from this environment, this might be the case, so I will just try it. So maybe this kind of these two points are basically the next things on all of this too, to explore nice."
"Unknown","01;40;55;09","01;41;45;14","It is like knowing other streets you could take. What if the road I always take is blocked and then there are so it's just cool. And what arises after your after you're implementing it? And in the chat, Stephen has been making some comments about the door and we discussed like being in the hallway. And then there's the pixel contrast to then like if there were a higher level concept of door probability of a door at that location so that that pixel change abruptly could be associated with a door and then, then there's this location of door, not just the pixel level mapping, but then there's like what does the door bridge to and what if"
"Unknown","01;41;45;14","01;42;04;26","it explores a closed room and now the door opens and then it can say, well, now I'm curious about what's out there for like what is that node a bottleneck? And that's like the door as Mark called Blanket. You know, what's what happens when you train it up on the warehouse, including with Curiosity and then you open the door what's going to happen?"
"Unknown","01;42;06;00","01;42;21;19","But these are awesome directions. So thank you for sharing it. Please. Do you have any final comments or questions? Just thinks this is super interesting to think about and explore and try to map on to my map of my cognition in my mind."
"Unknown","01;42;24;09","01;42;53;29","Yeah. Agreed. It was really cool to see the the analytical formal and the biological and the robotic coming together. And so much appreciated, Tim, for joining us and to Adam for joining previously and all the other authors. So hope to see you around. This is also for my side of the discussion opens up a lot of new perspectives also for me anyway new so thank you for that."
"Unknown","01;42;55;14","01;42;58;16","Thank you Tim. See you later. Thank you. Bye bye."
