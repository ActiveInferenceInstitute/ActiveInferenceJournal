"00;00;00;02","00;00;01;06","Some questions that we had"
"00;00;01;06","00;00;02;12","from the zero."
"00;00;02;12","00;00;04;28","But also new questions arising."
"00;00;04;28","00;00;06;21","So we'll just start with an introduction"
"00;00;06;21","00;00;07;16","and saying hello"
"00;00;07;16","00;00;08;27","and then it will be awesome"
"00;00;08;27","00;00;10;04","to hear the authors"
"00;00;10;04","00;00;12;07","initial contextualization."
"00;00;12;07","00;00;13;12","So I'm Daniel."
"00;00;13;12","00;00;15;05","I'm a researcher in California."
"00;00;15;05","00;00;16;15","And as explored"
"00;00;16;15","00;00;19;02","a little bit in the dot zero with Sid,"
"00;00;19;16","00;00;20;20","there's a few places"
"00;00;20;20","00;00;22;25","that we were super curious about,"
"00;00;22;26","00;00;23;24","ranging from"
"00;00;23;24","00;00;26;23","how does one go from a phenomena"
"00;00;26;23","00;00;27;29","that they want to model,"
"00;00;27;29","00;00;29;08","like navigation"
"00;00;29;08","00;00;32;04","to the analytical equations,"
"00;00;32;04","00;00;32;29","and how is that"
"00;00;32;29","00;00;34;03","related to active inference"
"00;00;34;03","00;00;35;08","and the free energy principle?"
"00;00;35;08","00;00;35;15","And then"
"00;00;35;15","00;00;36;00","how do we go"
"00;00;36;00","00;00;38;21","from that analytical formulation?"
"00;00;39;12","00;00;42;05","To the actual gigabyte of video data"
"00;00;42;05","00;00;43;28","and the real time sensing in action."
"00;00;43;28","00;00;46;03","So a lot of exciting topics"
"00;00;46;03","00;00;47;12","and all paths to blue"
"00;00;49;12","00;00;50;02","I am blue."
"00;00;50;02","00;00;52;03","I'm a researcher in New Mexico,"
"00;00;52;03","00;00;53;22","and this paper was"
"00;00;53;22","00;00;55;19","kind of way over my head"
"00;00;55;19","00;00;56;16","for a lot of reasons."
"00;00;56;16","00;00;57;10","It's just so far"
"00;00;57;10","00;00;59;09","out of what I normally do"
"00;00;59;09","00;01;01;19","but I have some questions related"
"00;01;01;19","00;01;03;27","to the hierarchical modeling"
"00;01;03;27","00;01;06;10","and how that is kind of used and"
"00;01;07;08","00;01;09;09","how that can be related"
"00;01;09;09","00;01;10;17","or cannot be related"
"00;01;10;17","00;01;12;17","to maybe biological systems"
"00;01;13;02","00;01;14;23","that model in a hierarchical way."
"00;01;14;23","00;01;17;25","Similarly, and I'll pass it off to Adam"
"00;01;17;25","00;01;19;11","I guess if you want to start"
"00;01;19;11","00;01;21;02","or introduce yourself then"
"00;01;21;02","00;01;23;06","and you guys can take it away"
"00;01;24;12","00;01;25;28","Hi, I'm Adam."
"00;01;25;28","00;01;28;18","I'm a systems neuroscientist who's"
"00;01;29;18","00;01;32;29","currently a research fellow at the Johns"
"00;01;32;29","00;01;33;23","Hopkins Center"
"00;01;33;23","00;01;34;29","for Psychedelics"
"00;01;34;29","00;01;37;15","and Consciousness Research"
"00;01;37;27","00;01;39;06","I've been collaborating with Tim and"
"00;01;39;06","00;01;41;28","Ozone and others on trying to"
"00;01;43;14","00;01;44;18","understand the nature"
"00;01;44;18","00;01;46;19","of navigation and"
"00;01;48;09","00;01;49;05","nature and the ways"
"00;01;49;05","00;01;49;15","in which"
"00;01;49;15","00;01;50;25","the hippocampal"
"00;01;50;25","00;01;52;01","and end to renal system"
"00;01;52;01","00;01;53;14","might be relevant"
"00;01;53;14","00;01;54;21","and the ways in which"
"00;01;54;21","00;01;55;15","this could be used"
"00;01;55;15","00;01;58;15","as a means of understanding"
"00;01;58;15","00;02;00;11","thought more generally."
"00;02;00;11","00;02;03;02","And it's been"
"00;02;03;14","00;02;05;16","awesome and slightly intimidating,"
"00;02;05;16","00;02;07;04","except Tim is awesome."
"00;02;07;04","00;02;09;27","So that's made it less intimidating."
"00;02;13;08","00;02;14;16","The lab brings it to me."
"00;02;14;16","00;02;15;22","Scientists"
"00;02;15;28","00;02;17;15","and their computer scientists"
"00;02;17;15","00;02;19;24","roboticists have gone to university"
"00;02;20;09","00;02;21;20","and we haven't subscribed"
"00;02;21;20","00;02;23;27","to the active inference formalism to"
"00;02;24;13","00;02;25;24","try to make"
"00;02;25;27","00;02;28;18","the selection more intelligent."
"00;02;28;29","00;02;30;18","But this paper."
"00;02;30;18","00;02;33;26","Well, I think one of our"
"00;02;33;26","00;02;36;16","major accomplishments last year"
"00;02;37;08","00;02;39;06","recently deliberation with the Edinburgh"
"00;02;39;06","00;02;42;03","based, we look at the problem from"
"00;02;43;04","00;02;45;17","navigation, from from different angles"
"00;02;45;17","00;02;48;29","ranging from active inference modeling"
"00;02;49;22","00;02;51;23","to an actual implementation"
"00;02;52;07","00;02;53;05","on a real robot."
"00;02;54;07","00;02;56;14","And at the same time looking at"
"00;02;56;28","00;03;00;29","how could this work in an actual brain"
"00;03;00;29","00;03;04;05","or model relations"
"00;03;04;05","00;03;05;10","and the synergies there."
"00;03;05;10","00;03;08;10","So it's really exciting"
"00;03;08;10","00;03;10;18","to get this paper out."
"00;03;10;18","00;03;13;29","But also this was just getting started."
"00;03;14;01","00;03;16;06","I'd say that it was basically our first"
"00;03;18;10","00;03;20;14","artifact that we published."
"00;03;20;22","00;03;20;29","We had"
"00;03;20;29","00;03;22;01","another run"
"00;03;22;01","00;03;24;03","together with Adam in the works"
"00;03;25;05","00;03;27;15","and yeah, I'm pretty sure"
"00;03;27;17","00;03;29;05","that we will continue this endeavor"
"00;03;29;05","00;03;31;14","for quite some time longer."
"00;03;31;17","00;03;33;15","So we're all just"
"00;03;33;15","00;03;34;20","only just getting started."
"00;03;34;20","00;03;36;22","So that being said,"
"00;03;38;01","00;03;39;13","probably a lot of the questions"
"00;03;39;13","00;03;42;16","are also still questions for us there"
"00;03;42;16","00;03;45;07","to see what extent we can give"
"00;03;45;07","00;03;46;03","an answer."
"00;03;46;03","00;03;48;04","As of today, already"
"00;03;49;01","00;03;49;20","awesome."
"00;03;49;20","00;03;50;08","Well,"
"00;03;50;08","00;03;53;21","we can start with this sort of triad"
"00;03;53;21","00;03;55;27","that is highlighted in the paper"
"00;03;57;03","00;03;58;04","and Adam, you said"
"00;03;58;04","00;03;58;10","it as"
"00;03;58;10","00;04;00;20","understanding the basis of navigation."
"00;04;00;20","00;04;02;04","And we have these three"
"00;04;02;04","00;04;04;19","legs to the stool, kind of three threads"
"00;04;04;19","00;04;06;10","that intertwine in the paper"
"00;04;06;10","00;04;07;04","with it"
"00;04;07;04","00;04;09;23","analytical formulation of navigation,"
"00;04;10;03","00;04;11;08","which is what Blue mentioned"
"00;04;11;08","00;04;13;08","with a hierarchical generative model"
"00;04;13;26","00;04;16;28","and the implementation in robotic"
"00;04;16;28","00;04;19;00","and in biological systems."
"00;04;19;07","00;04;21;13","So maybe a first question is"
"00;04;21;13","00;04;24;00","how has this intersection"
"00;04;24;13","00;04;26;26","of modeling navigation"
"00;04;26;26","00;04;28;15","with robotics and biology"
"00;04;28;15","00;04;30;02","been conceptualized?"
"00;04;30;02","00;04;31;09","And what brought you"
"00;04;31;09","00;04;33;16","to apply active inference in this way?"
"00;04;33;16","00;04;35;10","And what does it add"
"00;04;45;03","00;04;46;25","you should go first"
"00;04;49;13","00;04;49;27","though."
"00;04;51;11","00;04;53;07","So maybe my perspective here"
"00;04;53;07","00;04;53;27","is that"
"00;04;56;16","00;04;58;24","we basically got started from"
"00;05;00;02","00;05;01;20","from a robotics perspective,"
"00;05;01;20","00;05;04;23","like looking at the navigation problem"
"00;05;05;05","00;05;06;15","and looking at the"
"00;05;06;15","00;05;08;24","the ways that it's being solved"
"00;05;08;24","00;05;09;13","right now"
"00;05;10;18","00;05;13;01","and implemented right now."
"00;05;13;01","00;05;14;00","And at the same time,"
"00;05;14;00","00;05;16;28","we already have quite some experience"
"00;05;17;03","00;05;19;03","with active inference, but more like,"
"00;05;20;08","00;05;22;12","oh, yeah, simpler"
"00;05;22;12","00;05;25;14","problems, let's say, or first"
"00;05;25;14","00;05;27;22","or first experiments or more on"
"00;05;27;22","00;05;28;19","these kind of"
"00;05;28;23","00;05;30;11","mountain core"
"00;05;30;11","00;05;32;22","environments or smooth core research."
"00;05;33;05","00;05;35;09","But it will always our goal to kind of"
"00;05;35;09","00;05;37;29","drive skills up through"
"00;05;37;29","00;05;39;25","the real world robots."
"00;05;39;25","00;05;41;01","And so"
"00;05;42;27","00;05;44;15","we got started by"
"00;05;44;15","00;05;46;20","drawing and seeing parallels between"
"00;05;47;18","00;05;50;01","current civilizations out there."
"00;05;50;01","00;05;52;16","And that seemed to match with"
"00;05;53;10","00;05;55;10","how we would look at it"
"00;05;55;10","00;05;57;21","from an active inference perspective"
"00;05;57;21","00;06;01;00","and kind of work our way from both ways."
"00;06;01;00","00;06;01;28","So on the one hand,"
"00;06;01;28","00;06;04;08","try to get some implementation running"
"00;06;04;08","00;06;05;23","and on the other hand,"
"00;06;05;23","00;06;07;11","seeing how we could"
"00;06;07;11","00;06;08;12","formalize it"
"00;06;08;12","00;06;10;17","and actually made the math work."
"00;06;10;28","00;06;12;07","In the case of inference framework."
"00;06;13;10","00;06;14;05","And"
"00;06;15;02","00;06;15;27","what we found out"
"00;06;15;27","00;06;18;05","was that actually the best matching"
"00;06;19;22","00;06;21;23","implementation from a robotics"
"00;06;21;23","00;06;23;07","perspective was actually one"
"00;06;23;07","00;06;25;19","that was quite bio inspired."
"00;06;25;19","00;06;27;24","So it was basically the lab model"
"00;06;27;24","00;06;30;13","from Seattle where they had these"
"00;06;31;06","00;06;32;17","heavy inspiration from grid"
"00;06;32;17","00;06;34;25","cells, these cells and these things."
"00;06;35;13","00;06;37;18","And of course,"
"00;06;37;18","00;06;39;08","it was not really a surprise"
"00;06;39;08","00;06;40;18","given the fact"
"00;06;40;18","00;06;41;20","how active inference"
"00;06;41;20","00;06;44;00","is also grounded in neuroscience."
"00;06;44;15","00;06;44;29","And so that's"
"00;06;44;29","00;06;47;09","where we reached out to to them"
"00;06;48;21","00;06;51;01","to basically show off like a big"
"00;06;51;01","00;06;53;03","this is our trajectory,"
"00;06;53;22","00;06;55;05","this is our plan,"
"00;06;55;05","00;06;56;28","this is our current implementation."
"00;06;56;28","00;06;58;07","Then how do you think"
"00;06;58;07","00;07;00;28","the math could work"
"00;07;02;08","00;07;04;10","and then, Adam,"
"00;07;04;10","00;07;06;22","with this infinite knowledge"
"00;07;06;22","00;07;09;13","of how the"
"00;07;10;11","00;07;11;28","this could work in the range of"
"00;07;11;28","00;07;13;18","like all kind of forms was like, okay,"
"00;07;13;18","00;07;14;15","but this is interesting"
"00;07;14;15","00;07;16;16","because what you implemented here"
"00;07;16;16","00;07;17;19","is actually"
"00;07;17;27","00;07;18;18","a lot for local"
"00;07;18;18","00;07;19;25","like this kind of system."
"00;07;19;25","00;07;20;29","And what you're doing here"
"00;07;20;29","00;07;21;28","is actually"
"00;07;21;28","00;07;23;21","very much like these kind of things."
"00;07;23;21","00;07;25;01","And then we just set up"
"00;07;25;01","00;07;26;11","let's begin"
"00;07;26;11","00;07;29;02","this further and we basically"
"00;07;29;26","00;07;31;20","stole this on curving out"
"00;07;33;25","00;07;35;27","becoming like, OK, if this is"
"00;07;36;04","00;07;37;05","how it's done in the brain,"
"00;07;37;05","00;07;38;09","then maybe we can make something"
"00;07;38;09","00;07;40;13","more similar in the models"
"00;07;40;13","00;07;41;18","or in the implementation"
"00;07;41;18","00;07;44;20","and vice versa and"
"00;07;44;20","00;07;46;18","the was basically"
"00;07;46;18","00;07;50;07","the first step where we had like"
"00;07;50;07","00;07;52;13","the three bits kind of in place."
"00;07;52;13","00;07;55;00","But we know where the open issues are,"
"00;07;56;12","00;07;59;08","but it actually had something working"
"00;07;59;24","00;08;03;06","and sensible on all three levels,"
"00;08;03;07","00;08;04;06","I'd say."
"00;08;04;12","00;08;07;19","And that's, that's the very me we are at"
"00;08;08;03","00;08;09;13","at this moment."
"00;08;11;26","00;08;12;13","Awesome."
"00;08;12;13","00;08;13;05","Thank you, Adam."
"00;08;13;05","00;08;16;28","Anything you add to that"
"00;08;17;04","00;08;17;17","well,"
"00;08;18;27","00;08;20;27","I guess what I would add is"
"00;08;20;27","00;08;23;02","an increasingly"
"00;08;25;00","00;08;27;29","compelled by the idea that"
"00;08;27;29","00;08;31;06","robotics as a touchstone and basis"
"00;08;31;06","00;08;32;16","for understanding"
"00;08;32;16","00;08;33;09","different aspects of"
"00;08;33;09","00;08;35;02","mind is like"
"00;08;35;02","00;08;37;11","it might be the most powerful kind of"
"00;08;39;18","00;08;42;01","grounded empiricism we can do."
"00;08;42;01","00;08;45;00","And I think it's both because it's like"
"00;08;46;05","00;08;47;08","a lot of times, like that Feynman"
"00;08;47;08","00;08;48;03","quote of like,"
"00;08;48;03","00;08;48;27","what I can cannot build"
"00;08;48;27","00;08;51;00","I cannot understand is like mentioned,"
"00;08;51;00","00;08;52;08","but this is actually building"
"00;08;52;08","00;08;53;22","systems that"
"00;08;54;09","00;08;54;29","this is"
"00;08;56;03","00;08;58;08","that have to work and"
"00;08;58;08","00;09;00;21","and that these problems"
"00;09;01;00","00;09;02;06","like in going through them"
"00;09;02;06","00;09;04;06","and looking at the different solutions"
"00;09;04;06","00;09;05;19","like the kind of understanding"
"00;09;05;19","00;09;08;01","you get I think is really unique"
"00;09;08;28","00;09;11;18","but also I think it's particularly apps"
"00;09;11;18","00;09;14;01","because of what our minds"
"00;09;14;01","00;09;15;00","other than control"
"00;09;15;00","00;09;16;18","cybernetic control systems"
"00;09;16;18","00;09;17;26","for bodies"
"00;09;17;26","00;09;19;25","that have to move through the world."
"00;09;19;25","00;09;21;09","And so this idea"
"00;09;21;09","00;09;21;29","that like the way"
"00;09;21;29","00;09;24;24","roboticists are approaching it like it's"
"00;09;26;09","00;09;29;26","and that is the exact problem"
"00;09;29;26","00;09;31;04","that nature had to solve"
"00;09;31;04","00;09;32;18","but natural selection has a self"
"00;09;32;18","00;09;34;11","and now the question is was it the same"
"00;09;34;11","00;09;36;08","it might be in some cases"
"00;09;36;08","00;09;39;20","as you'd expect within the bounds"
"00;09;40;03","00;09;43;05","of nature to be a fairly clever"
"00;09;43;11","00;09;44;08","blind designer"
"00;09;46;04","00;09;47;26","in terms of what you might discover"
"00;09;47;26","00;09;48;29","and so"
"00;09;49;06","00;09;50;10","just this going back"
"00;09;50;10","00;09;51;15","and forth between the"
"00;09;51;15","00;09;53;16","the robotics perspective"
"00;09;53;16","00;09;56;03","and how it might work in biology"
"00;09;56;03","00;09;57;23","and then this abstract ways"
"00;09;57;23","00;09;59;10","that there are the,"
"00;09;59;10","00;10;00;01","the abstract"
"00;10;00;01","00;10;01;23","algorithmic implementations of them"
"00;10;01;23","00;10;03;09","for the robots"
"00;10;03;09","00;10;03;26","and seeing"
"00;10;03;26","00;10;04;16","how those can mutually"
"00;10;04;16","00;10;05;07","inform each other."
"00;10;05;07","00;10;08;01","It's that for me, it's a"
"00;10;10;04","00;10;11;11","this is how I basically want"
"00;10;11;11","00;10;12;25","all my thinking about the mind"
"00;10;12;25","00;10;13;29","to be formalized."
"00;10;13;29","00;10;15;00","Like, I feel like this is just like"
"00;10;15;00","00;10;16;08","this is how it is"
"00;10;16;08","00;10;17;23","that this is the most powerful way of"
"00;10;17;23","00;10;18;29","thinking on it."
"00;10;19;03","00;10;20;27","That back and forth"
"00;10;26;00","00;10;26;23","let's entering"
"00;10;26;23","00;10;28;00","the biological door"
"00;10;28;00","00;10;29;28","or blue, do you have a question?"
"00;10;29;28","00;10;33;02","OK, so Adam, what"
"00;10;34;09","00;10;36;10","even though of course it's a deep area"
"00;10;36;10","00;10;37;20","and there's writing in the paper"
"00;10;37;20","00;10;38;09","and citations"
"00;10;38;09","00;10;39;12","and so on,"
"00;10;39;12","00;10;41;04","what is so interesting"
"00;10;41;04","00;10;42;09","about the structuring"
"00;10;42;09","00;10;44;28","of the grid cells through space and time"
"00;10;45;10","00;10;47;16","and what can we learn from that about"
"00;10;47;28","00;10;49;16","effective ways of navigating"
"00;11;07;04","00;11;07;27","so"
"00;11;11;00","00;11;14;25","in in latent slam"
"00;11;14;25","00;11;15;29","we have these pose cells"
"00;11;15;29","00;11;17;09","and actually I think"
"00;11;18;06","00;11;19;01","probably better for him"
"00;11;19;01","00;11;19;25","to talk about that,"
"00;11;19;25","00;11;21;00","like the exact ways"
"00;11;21;00","00;11;22;15","in which these cells function"
"00;11;22;15","00;11;24;09","within the robotic system."
"00;11;24;09","00;11;26;00","I think that actually brings"
"00;11;26;00","00;11;27;11","more clarity"
"00;11;27;11","00;11;30;28","than the more mysterious like so"
"00;11;31;10","00;11;32;07","there's lots of ideas"
"00;11;32;07","00;11;32;28","been going around"
"00;11;32;28","00;11;34;09","like computational neuroscience stuff"
"00;11;34;09","00;11;36;09","like what the brain cells might do."
"00;11;36;09","00;11;37;08","But I actually think"
"00;11;37;08","00;11;38;24","the greatest clarity comes from like,"
"00;11;38;24","00;11;39;05","well,"
"00;11;39;05","00;11;40;11","how would the analogs work"
"00;11;40;11","00;11;41;05","in the robotic system?"
"00;11;41;05","00;11;43;10","So kick that's a term"
"00;11;43;10","00;11;44;23","what do you think to"
"00;11;46;28","00;11;47;12","yeah."
"00;11;47;12","00;11;50;02","So I think that's in"
"00;11;51;24","00;11;53;11","implementation."
"00;11;53;11","00;11;55;22","The the parallel with grid."
"00;11;55;22","00;11;57;27","So that's kind of"
"00;11;57;27","00;12;00;20","on hardwired in the patient."
"00;12;00;22","00;12;02;22","So this by design,"
"00;12;03;01","00;12;05;14","you have something that looks"
"00;12;05;14","00;12;08;05","if you squint your eyes a lot,"
"00;12;08;05","00;12;09;11","it looks a bit like grooves."
"00;12;09;11","00;12;11;13","So I wouldn't say that we actually have"
"00;12;12;15","00;12;14;14","grid cells in here"
"00;12;15;03","00;12;15;18","because to me"
"00;12;15;18","00;12;17;15","the group sort of basically"
"00;12;17;15","00;12;19;28","it should be an abstract, it should be"
"00;12;21;21","00;12;23;28","giving you a way"
"00;12;24;11","00;12;26;26","of modeling movement"
"00;12;26;26","00;12;29;02","in an abstract space basically."
"00;12;29;02","00;12;31;09","And in the case of navigation,"
"00;12;31;24","00;12;33;00","the space"
"00;12;33;00","00;12;35;05","by accident maps to the real world"
"00;12;35;25","00;12;38;21","and the grid cell activation is just the"
"00;12;39;04","00;12;41;06","the grid, an array of"
"00;12;42;07","00;12;45;09","encoding where you are in space"
"00;12;46;03","00;12;47;07","without"
"00;12;48;26","00;12;50;22","without just giving you the x"
"00;12;50;22","00;12;51;20","y coordinates."
"00;12;51;20","00;12;53;21","Basically, there's a more kind of"
"00;12;56;11","00;12;58;02","higher dimensional,"
"00;12;58;02","00;13;01;08","more robust representation of"
"00;13;01;08","00;13;01;29","where are you"
"00;13;01;29","00;13;03;10","on this on the grid"
"00;13;03;10","00;13;05;26","and how do you define our move"
"00;13;05;26","00;13;08;16","how those how does your"
"00;13;08;16","00;13;11;15","location in in this reference frame"
"00;13;11;15","00;13;13;28","or does this change"
"00;13;13;28","00;13;15;02","as we know"
"00;13;15;02","00;13;16;00","in our representation,"
"00;13;16;00","00;13;17;16","we basically just said"
"00;13;17;16","00;13;20;19","we know that we are in the roughly flat"
"00;13;21;16","00;13;23;03","surface world."
"00;13;23;03","00;13;25;15","So the main coordinates that"
"00;13;25;18","00;13;26;14","we need to correct"
"00;13;26;14","00;13;28;26","and integrate over are the x,"
"00;13;28;26","00;13;30;16","x, y position and"
"00;13;31;29","00;13;32;27","the head direction."
"00;13;32;27","00;13;35;24","These are basically the main things."
"00;13;36;12","00;13;38;16","And we use this thing"
"00;13;38;16","00;13;39;13","called the continuous"
"00;13;39;13","00;13;42;14","director network to kind of represent"
"00;13;44;04","00;13;45;23","this street coordinates."
"00;13;45;23","00;13;46;19","And"
"00;13;47;13","00;13;49;10","we basically"
"00;13;50;22","00;13;51;26","inject knowledge"
"00;13;51;26","00;13;55;10","that if you move forward, then"
"00;13;55;10","00;13;56;28","you will also move forward."
"00;13;56;28","00;13;58;02","In this,"
"00;13;59;07","00;14;01;05","the director network"
"00;14;01;05","00;14;03;25","location and"
"00;14;04;27","00;14;06;16","roughly this, this corresponds"
"00;14;06;16","00;14;08;18","to doing kind of false integration."
"00;14;08;18","00;14;10;28","And I'm pretty sure the grid cells are"
"00;14;12;20","00;14;16;02","giving you similar functionality"
"00;14;16;06","00;14;16;23","in the brain"
"00;14;16;23","00;14;18;09","that I would not say that"
"00;14;18;09","00;14;19;16","our current implementation"
"00;14;19;16","00;14;20;24","actually has good rules."
"00;14;20;24","00;14;21;23","I think the parallel"
"00;14;21;23","00;14;24;03","is more with these cells"
"00;14;25;07","00;14;27;13","because there we do have kind of"
"00;14;27;13","00;14;30;11","we do learn representations from"
"00;14;30;27","00;14;33;24","visual sensory inputs that kind of"
"00;14;34;09","00;14;36;17","give you an and this is the middle,"
"00;14;37;13","00;14;39;14","this is a particular location."
"00;14;39;14","00;14;41;18","And if you see a similar or better"
"00;14;42;06","00;14;44;07","than it is likely"
"00;14;44;07","00;14;45;04","that you are visiting"
"00;14;45;04","00;14;46;27","the same location again."
"00;14;46;27","00;14;49;03","And if at the same time"
"00;14;49;15","00;14;53;04","you happen to have a very similar X, y"
"00;14;53;27","00;14;55;29","and head direction as in your"
"00;14;56;13","00;14;58;26","as in your previous time, you, you"
"00;14;59;17","00;15;00;29","saw something similar,"
"00;15;01;27","00;15;02;18","then you're"
"00;15;02;18","00;15;03;02","pretty good"
"00;15;03;02","00;15;04;08","evidence that you are actually"
"00;15;04;08","00;15;06;00","in the same spot."
"00;15;06;00","00;15;07;01","And then"
"00;15;07;06","00;15;08;04","this is what you then go"
"00;15;08;04","00;15;08;29","loop closure"
"00;15;08;29","00;15;12;01","and then you kind of reorient yourself"
"00;15;12;21","00;15;15;01","as if you were at the same location."
"00;15;15;01","00;15;17;25","So that's kind of how I would"
"00;15;19;16","00;15;20;23","think of"
"00;15;21;02","00;15;23;11","cells and body cells in North Korea."
"00;15;23;11","00;15;23;27","Current"
"00;15;28;04","00;15;28;18","thank you."
"00;15;28;18","00;15;30;15","Blue, do you have any questions?"
"00;15;30;15","00;15;32;09","Yes, please go for it."
"00;15;32;15","00;15;35;20","So I'm curious as to"
"00;15;36;26","00;15;37;17","the role,"
"00;15;37;17","00;15;40;03","if any, or how the system may change"
"00;15;41;06","00;15;43;16","if you included propria reception,"
"00;15;43;16","00;15;44;24","which is like"
"00;15;44;24","00;15;45;11","the sense"
"00;15;45;11","00;15;48;02","of where your body is in space."
"00;15;48;02","00;15;48;23","And so"
"00;15;48;23","00;15;49;10","like this is"
"00;15;49;10","00;15;50;08","partially modeled"
"00;15;50;08","00;15;52;08","through the visual system"
"00;15;52;08","00;15;53;23","at play cells, grid cells, et cetera."
"00;15;53;23","00;15;55;28","But it's it's not always right."
"00;15;55;28","00;15;58;02","So it includes other senses like balance"
"00;15;58;02","00;15;59;16","and where's my hand"
"00;15;59;16","00;16;01;06","and these kinds of things."
"00;16;01;06","00;16;02;02","And I'm just curious"
"00;16;02;02","00;16;04;07","if your model"
"00;16;04;07","00;16;08;11","includes that in any way or only or not"
"00;16;08;11","00;16;11;17","or how it may change if it did give it"
"00;16;11;18","00;16;13;01","give it kind of like a more embodied"
"00;16;14;22","00;16;14;29","yeah."
"00;16;14;29","00;16;16;16","So so basically"
"00;16;16;16","00;16;20;06","in our case, the reception is limited to"
"00;16;21;22","00;16;23;14","basically the"
"00;16;23;14","00;16;25;07","the velocity commands that you"
"00;16;25;07","00;16;27;14","that you issued to the to the robot."
"00;16;27;14","00;16;29;20","It also observes these again,"
"00;16;29;20","00;16;31;19","so it assumes that it knows"
"00;16;31;19","00;16;32;29","which command sending"
"00;16;32;29","00;16;35;09","and then these are also going to"
"00;16;35;09","00;16;36;04","be fed back"
"00;16;36;04","00;16;38;18","through the model as kind of a sensor."
"00;16;38;26","00;16;41;27","So if you say drive forward or turn left"
"00;16;41;27","00;16;42;19","or turn right"
"00;16;42;19","00;16;44;20","with this kind of anger of all this,"
"00;16;44;20","00;16;47;12","this information is also sent"
"00;16;47;12","00;16;48;20","into the model"
"00;16;48;20","00;16;49;11","and this is"
"00;16;49;11","00;16;50;24","then what we call the action."
"00;16;50;24","00;16;52;13","So I remember in the"
"00;16;52;13","00;16;54;10","especially in the low level mobile"
"00;16;54;10","00;16;57;09","injection for this is basically you can"
"00;16;57;09","00;16;59;25","you can see this as kind of a pro-U.S."
"00;17;00;28","00;17;01;18","thing."
"00;17;01;22","00;17;03;26","And so everything"
"00;17;03;26","00;17;07;10","kind of predicts what will happen given"
"00;17;08;18","00;17;09;24","given what I,"
"00;17;09;24","00;17;12;04","I sense that I was doing basically"
"00;17;13;22","00;17;14;25","and we do it"
"00;17;14;25","00;17;16;28","both for the for the visual sensor,"
"00;17;16;28","00;17;17;18","like what's what"
"00;17;17;18","00;17;18;12","I see if I"
"00;17;18;12","00;17;19;09","if I'm turning left"
"00;17;19;09","00;17;22;05","or right to go forward, but also for"
"00;17;23;22","00;17;25;08","tracking the force"
"00;17;25;08","00;17;26;21","and doing the integration."
"00;17;26;21","00;17;28;09","Like if I move forward"
"00;17;28;09","00;17;30;23","and my heading was zero angle,"
"00;17;30;29","00;17;32;26","then I will probably just move forward"
"00;17;32;26","00;17;34;27","to the X direction of the, of the,"
"00;17;36;22","00;17;40;12","of the became"
"00;17;42;06","00;17;43;14","and that introduction"
"00;17;43;14","00;17;46;17","of counterfactuals and anticipation."
"00;17;46;18","00;17;48;00","What would happen"
"00;17;48;00","00;17;51;23","if I did this is very interesting area."
"00;17;51;23","00;17;55;04","And also it speaks"
"00;17;55;04","00;17;56;12","to the Campos ability"
"00;17;56;12","00;17;57;09","and the flexibility"
"00;17;57;09","00;17;58;29","of the active inference model."
"00;17;58;29","00;18;00;02","Like I said, highlighted"
"00;18;00;02","00;18;01;22","that only the visual data"
"00;18;01;22","00;18;03;07","were being used here"
"00;18;03;07","00;18;05;19","with RG B values of video."
"00;18;05;19","00;18;07;27","But there are other kinds of sensors"
"00;18;08;08","00;18;09;25","that could be used"
"00;18;09;25","00;18;10;24","as another sense state"
"00;18;10;24","00;18;11;23","and that would kind of increase"
"00;18;11;23","00;18;13;13","the dimensionality of the model."
"00;18;13;13","00;18;15;04","Maybe it is a value add,"
"00;18;15;04","00;18;17;27","maybe it's not, but it doesn't require"
"00;18;18;14","00;18;19;12","RI writing."
"00;18;19;12","00;18;20;25","It's like more like plugging"
"00;18;20;25","00;18;22;07","in a different hard drive"
"00;18;22;07","00;18;23;06","than it is like having"
"00;18;23;06","00;18;24;11","a different computer."
"00;18;25;21","00;18;27;09","So you mentioned a"
"00;18;27;09","00;18;27;21","higher"
"00;18;27;21","00;18;29;09","dimensional robust"
"00;18;29;09","00;18;31;11","representation of location,"
"00;18;31;27","00;18;34;11","and that's definitely one of the"
"00;18;34;11","00;18;37;05","advantages and and aspects of the model"
"00;18;37;05","00;18;38;10","that'll be important"
"00;18;38;10","00;18;42;00","to explore more like in the dot zero,"
"00;18;42;00","00;18;43;26","we explored this paper,"
"00;18;43;26","00;18;46;03","are we ready for service robots"
"00;18;46;03","00;18;46;18","that showed"
"00;18;46;18","00;18;48;15","how sometimes even trivial changes"
"00;18;48;15","00;18;49;25","to environments"
"00;18;49;25","00;18;52;05","can result in the robot getting lost"
"00;18;52;05","00;18;53;14","because it has reference"
"00;18;53;14","00;18;55;01","to something like a chair"
"00;18;55;01","00;18;57;09","that's no longer at the same location."
"00;18;57;25","00;19;01;14","So how does this model"
"00;19;02;29","00;19;04;27","provide a higher dimensional, robust"
"00;19;04;27","00;19;07;02","representation of location"
"00;19;07;02","00;19;09;17","and how did you go from"
"00;19;09;17","00;19;10;18","thinking about that"
"00;19;10;18","00;19;11;28","to the actual way"
"00;19;11;28","00;19;14;18","that the generative model is framed?"
"00;19;15;20","00;19;16;22","That's the first question."
"00;19;16;22","00;19;17;18","And then"
"00;19;17;18","00;19;18;22","the second part is going to be about"
"00;19;18;22","00;19;20;09","how do you go from the framing"
"00;19;20;09","00;19;20;17","to the"
"00;19;20;17","00;19;22;20","actual computational implementation,"
"00;19;22;20","00;19;23;27","but just the first stage"
"00;19;23;27","00;19;24;26","of this pipeline,"
"00;19;24;26","00;19;28;05","how do we go from wishing upon a star"
"00;19;28;11","00;19;30;12","that we could have biologically inspired"
"00;19;30;21","00;19;32;11","resilient navigation"
"00;19;32;11","00;19;33;18","to writing down the"
"00;19;33;18","00;19;35;02","formalisms as you had them"
"00;19;38;07","00;19;39;07","and so"
"00;19;40;29","00;19;43;02","to get back at your your first"
"00;19;43;17","00;19;45;08","the problems that you"
"00;19;45;08","00;19;47;02","that you mentioned on the on"
"00;19;47;02","00;19;48;18","the service robot like."
"00;19;48;18","00;19;49;22","So basically"
"00;19;49;22","00;19;52;27","the major problem in robotics slam"
"00;19;53;21","00;19;55;03","is that indeed"
"00;19;55;03","00;19;57;02","if your environment changes"
"00;19;57;02","00;19;59;08","like your bits, then then"
"00;20;00;09","00;20;01;09","the same location"
"00;20;01;09","00;20;03;03","doesn't look the same anymore"
"00;20;03;03","00;20;05;00","in whatever sensor modality"
"00;20;05;00","00;20;06;07","you're using."
"00;20;06;07","00;20;08;19","And that can be problematic,"
"00;20;08;28","00;20;11;11","especially if you if you want to model"
"00;20;11;21","00;20;13;22","the environment"
"00;20;13;22","00;20;16;01","as like the metric system"
"00;20;16;01","00;20;18;25","where you basically"
"00;20;18;28","00;20;20;17","define this is my origin."
"00;20;20;17","00;20;22;04","So this is see where zero"
"00;20;22;04","00;20;23;19","in the grid system."
"00;20;23;19","00;20;25;26","And now I will"
"00;20;25;26","00;20;27;11","for every obstacle"
"00;20;27;11","00;20;30;18","or thing that I approach I really lost"
"00;20;30;19","00;20;32;29","my estimation of the x y coordinates."
"00;20;33;26","00;20;36;00","And then suddenly when your chair moves,"
"00;20;36;00","00;20;37;05","of course"
"00;20;37;24","00;20;39;07","everything breaks"
"00;20;40;07","00;20;41;01","here."
"00;20;41;01","00;20;43;11","And in this system"
"00;20;43;11","00;20;46;02","we actually get rid of"
"00;20;46;02","00;20;48;20","being grounded in the metric space"
"00;20;49;03","00;20;51;19","the only thing that matters is that"
"00;20;53;09","00;20;55;11","this location looks very similar"
"00;20;55;14","00;20;56;26","to something"
"00;20;56;26","00;20;58;16","I visited before"
"00;20;58;16","00;21;01;15","and it also seems likely, given the"
"00;21;01;19","00;21;04;16","the integrated"
"00;21;05;04","00;21;07;16","trajectory I assumed I was following."
"00;21;07;25","00;21;10;11","So this might be the same spot."
"00;21;10;11","00;21;11;20","And if you think"
"00;21;11;20","00;21;13;28","that or if the chair moves"
"00;21;15;18","00;21;17;09","in the place"
"00;21;17;09","00;21;19;11","that that's fine, then you just say, OK,"
"00;21;19;11","00;21;20;20","maybe it's a different spot."
"00;21;20;20","00;21;22;21","It doesn't really matter"
"00;21;24;22","00;21;26;04","at some points"
"00;21;26;04","00;21;28;17","you will have kind of a cue"
"00;21;28;25","00;21;30;21","that is stable, right?"
"00;21;30;21","00;21;32;24","So and that's actually what we also do"
"00;21;32;24","00;21;34;23","as humans, if you want to navigate,"
"00;21;34;23","00;21;36;06","you just look for"
"00;21;36;06","00;21;38;04","the cues that you are"
"00;21;38;04","00;21;39;18","that you know, that are pretty stable."
"00;21;39;18","00;21;41;24","If you visit a new town,"
"00;21;41;24","00;21;43;16","you will look for church tower"
"00;21;43;16","00;21;45;01","because you know it will not move."
"00;21;45;01","00;21;45;28","You will not"
"00;21;46;04","00;21;47;04","orient yourself"
"00;21;47;04","00;21;48;29","based on the color of the cars"
"00;21;48;29","00;21;51;23","that are forth somewhere. So"
"00;21;52;24","00;21;53;17","I think"
"00;21;54;03","00;21;56;22","by by using the active inference"
"00;21;57;15","00;22;01;14","principle as a starting point,"
"00;22;02;20","00;22;03;10","you can"
"00;22;03;10","00;22;05;20","you can get rid of all a lot of these"
"00;22;05;21","00;22;06;17","these problems"
"00;22;06;17","00;22;08;19","because your agents will automatically"
"00;22;09;29","00;22;12;04","look for disabled cues"
"00;22;12;04","00;22;14;19","and if suddenly the environment changes."
"00;22;14;19","00;22;17;02","But just accept this and just model"
"00;22;17;03","00;22;18;00","it as like,"
"00;22;18;00","00;22;22;03","OK, I, I think I'm revisiting"
"00;22;22;13","00;22;24;15","this same trajectory,"
"00;22;24;22","00;22;26;06","but now it looks different."
"00;22;26;06","00;22;28;07","So maybe I just have to model"
"00;22;28;14","00;22;30;27","such as this is kind of the trajectory."
"00;22;30;27","00;22;32;13","This can change often"
"00;22;32;13","00;22;34;22","and maybe this implies that"
"00;22;35;06","00;22;37;11","if you plan the next time"
"00;22;37;23","00;22;38;06","you do,"
"00;22;38;06","00;22;38;13","I would"
"00;22;38;13","00;22;40;05","prefer a different trajectory"
"00;22;40;05","00;22;42;16","where you know that everything is stable"
"00;22;42;16","00;22;44;05","so this is the,"
"00;22;44;05","00;22;47;13","the same as reducing your ambiguity."
"00;22;47;27","00;22;50;04","So I think that getting rid of"
"00;22;51;05","00;22;52;04","everything from"
"00;22;52;04","00;22;55;15","this structure in this X Y location,"
"00;22;56;02","00;22;58;03","in the metric space and else"
"00;22;58;03","00;22;59;20","I don't know what's going on"
"00;22;59;20","00;23;01;04","just by getting rid of that"
"00;23;01;04","00;23;04;19","and and just assume anything can happen,"
"00;23;04;19","00;23;05;17","anything can change."
"00;23;05;17","00;23;07;27","And if it does not change, I prefer"
"00;23;08;05","00;23;10;05","I like it better."
"00;23;10;05","00;23;11;29","This helps a lot"
"00;23;12;04","00;23;12;27","to circumvent"
"00;23;12;27","00;23;16;11","a lot of the traditional problems of the"
"00;23;18;24","00;23;19;13","Foo."
"00;23;19;17","00;23;23;14","Adam, anything to add on that"
"00;23;24;00","00;23;26;03","I mean, so one of the things"
"00;23;26;13","00;23;29;19","that we've been working on is so"
"00;23;29;19","00;23;30;12","like in this paper,"
"00;23;30;12","00;23;32;00","it's like trying to say, OK, OK,"
"00;23;32;00","00;23;34;03","so to what degree"
"00;23;35;04","00;23;37;06","are the principles of what we understand"
"00;23;37;26","00;23;38;29","about like the natures"
"00;23;38;29","00;23;40;08","of like hippocampal"
"00;23;40;08","00;23;42;04","enteritis system being reflected"
"00;23;42;04","00;23;43;12","in this simultaneous"
"00;23;43;12","00;23;44;02","localization"
"00;23;44;02","00;23;47;11","and mapping problem and latency"
"00;23;47;24","00;23;49;19","and some of the other work"
"00;23;49;19","00;23;51;02","that we're doing is also going"
"00;23;51;02","00;23;53;03","the reverse direction of"
"00;23;55;09","00;23;56;05","what, you know,"
"00;23;56;05","00;23;58;13","what can these principles"
"00;23;59;03","00;24;00;09","of these"
"00;24;00;09","00;24;01;13","same principles use"
"00;24;01;13","00;24;03;13","for autonomous navigation."
"00;24;03;13","00;24;05;01","What can you tell us about"
"00;24;05;01","00;24;05;26","the brain functioning"
"00;24;05;26","00;24;07;01","as a cybernetic system?"
"00;24;07;01","00;24;10;14","And so one idea in general"
"00;24;10;14","00;24;11;09","is that"
"00;24;11;26","00;24;13;27","each of these operations, in addition"
"00;24;13;27","00;24;15;17","to having this"
"00;24;15;22","00;24;18;17","fundamental significance of the"
"00;24;18;21","00;24;20;02","of the basics of being able"
"00;24;20;02","00;24;23;04","to move through the world is, you know,"
"00;24;24;05","00;24;24;19","tasks"
"00;24;24;19","00;24;27;13","and any active inferential system that's"
"00;24;28;25","00;24;30;29","going to survive and repeat and"
"00;24;31;15","00;24;33;12","do what it needs to do has to handle."
"00;24;33;12","00;24;33;26","But"
"00;24;35;16","00;24;37;06","to what extent"
"00;24;37;13","00;24;39;28","were these same principles repurposed"
"00;24;39;28","00;24;42;05","for sophisticated inference"
"00;24;42;05","00;24;43;14","more generally?"
"00;24;43;14","00;24;44;12","And there are actual"
"00;24;44;12","00;24;47;06","and to what degree is sophisticated"
"00;24;47;06","00;24;49;02","inference structured"
"00;24;49;02","00;24;51;11","according to some principles."
"00;24;52;04","00;24;53;08","And so,"
"00;24;54;14","00;24;56;15","so if you talk about things like loop"
"00;24;56;15","00;24;57;10","closure or events"
"00;24;57;10","00;24;57;25","like this one"
"00;24;57;25","00;25;00;26","in this highly familiar state"
"00;25;01;07","00;25;02;13","and where you think"
"00;25;02;13","00;25;03;17","you know where you are by this"
"00;25;04;19","00;25;05;18","convergence of like"
"00;25;05;18","00;25;06;26","your trajectory information"
"00;25;06;26","00;25;08;11","and your pose,"
"00;25;08;20","00;25;10;21","this question would be like,"
"00;25;10;21","00;25;13;04","is this a model potentially for"
"00;25;13;04","00;25;16;17","the feeling of insight or discovering"
"00;25;16;17","00;25;19;04","of like causal accounts?"
"00;25;20;11","00;25;21;05","Is this"
"00;25;22;21","00;25;24;15","and is this actually a inter"
"00;25;24;15","00;25;25;27","an intra individual"
"00;25;25;27","00;25;27;01","source of internal"
"00;25;27;01","00;25;28;22","individual differences,"
"00;25;28;22","00;25;30;14","which would be fairly fundamental,"
"00;25;30;14","00;25;31;13","like how familiar"
"00;25;31;13","00;25;35;06","do you think things are or not?"
"00;25;36;04","00;25;37;26","How much do you update"
"00;25;37;26","00;25;38;27","on a county"
"00;25;38;27","00;25;39;29","or any country"
"00;25;39;29","00;25;42;01","in these highly familiar situations?"
"00;25;42;01","00;25;42;29","And so like"
"00;25;43;06","00;25;44;15","so for me personally,"
"00;25;44;15","00;25;46;01","what I've been wondering is, OK,"
"00;25;46;01","00;25;46;27","so to what extent"
"00;25;46;27","00;25;49;05","like of all the details,"
"00;25;49;05","00;25;50;24","so to what degree"
"00;25;50;24","00;25;51;07","so re"
"00;25;51;07","00;25;53;10","representing the biological details"
"00;25;53;17","00;25;54;14","in terms"
"00;25;54;14","00;25;55;24","of the kinds of descriptions"
"00;25;55;24","00;25;58;24","that Tim is giving here and also"
"00;25;58;24","00;26;01;11","the thinking of cognition"
"00;26;01;11","00;26;03;03","more generally as navigation"
"00;26;03;03","00;26;04;04","and so thinking of like"
"00;26;04;04","00;26;04;26","each of these things,"
"00;26;04;26","00;26;06;19","what are the analogs"
"00;26;06;19","00;26;07;22","at the level of thought"
"00;26;09;16","00;26;10;00","as a kind"
"00;26;10;00","00;26;13;18","of navigation through generalized space"
"00;26;13;24","00;26;14;04","wow."
"00;26;14;19","00;26;17;22","Awesome map and navigation."
"00;26;17;22","00;26;19;14","A lot of interesting work"
"00;26;19;14","00;26;20;24","on exploration,"
"00;26;20;24","00;26;22;13","exploitation in mind"
"00;26;22;13","00;26;24;25","and space hills at all 20, 15"
"00;26;25;03","00;26;28;01","and on thinking about planning"
"00;26;28;01","00;26;29;10","and the evolution of planning"
"00;26;29;10","00;26;31;01","as being related to spatial"
"00;26;31;01","00;26;33;13","as well as cognitive foraging split"
"00;26;36;00","00;26;37;00","so it's interesting"
"00;26;37;00","00;26;40;04","to think about cognition as navigation."
"00;26;40;25","00;26;42;16","Like I think about the feeling"
"00;26;42;16","00;26;43;07","that I have"
"00;26;43;07","00;26;44;02","when I'm like"
"00;26;44;02","00;26;46;07","searching for a thought,"
"00;26;46;07","00;26;48;08","a word, a name of a person."
"00;26;48;08","00;26;50;23","Like it literally feels like a"
"00;26;50;23","00;26;51;16","like you're"
"00;26;51;16","00;26;53;09","scrolling through a filing cabinet,"
"00;26;53;09","00;26;55;22","like physically looking for"
"00;26;56;03","00;26;56;17","this like"
"00;26;56;17","00;26;59;09","piece of information in your brain."
"00;26;59;09","00;27;02;11","And I know that like different neurons,"
"00;27;02;11","00;27;03;18","like store different"
"00;27;03;18","00;27;04;22","pieces of information"
"00;27;04;22","00;27;06;15","like the Jennifer Aniston neuron and,"
"00;27;06;15","00;27;08;07","and these kinds of things."
"00;27;08;07","00;27;09;09","So I wonder what"
"00;27;10;20","00;27;12;00","can you just elaborate maybe"
"00;27;12;00","00;27;12;11","a little bit"
"00;27;12;11","00;27;13;06","more on that, Adam,"
"00;27;13;06","00;27;15;27","about cognition as navigation, is it"
"00;27;15;27","00;27;17;08","like literally navigating"
"00;27;17;08","00;27;18;10","to find the right"
"00;27;18;10","00;27;19;00","like neuron"
"00;27;19;00","00;27;20;08","that goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding?"
"00;27;20;08","00;27;22;05","That's the one I wanted"
"00;27;22;21","00;27;23;20","for like"
"00;27;24;17","00;27;26;05","to subject to it could be."
"00;27;26;05","00;27;27;22","And that like"
"00;27;27;28","00;27;28;11","so too"
"00;27;28;11","00;27;28;27","is it"
"00;27;28;27","00;27;29;25","might think of this one"
"00;27;29;25","00;27;32;04","like you were talking"
"00;27;32;04","00;27;32;13","before"
"00;27;32;13","00;27;33;03","and you really bring up"
"00;27;33;03","00;27;34;23","like memory palaces"
"00;27;34;23","00;27;35;29","and I think that would be like one"
"00;27;35;29","00;27;36;27","example of thought"
"00;27;36;27","00;27;38;23","navigation, navigation,"
"00;27;38;23","00;27;39;19","which is like with this"
"00;27;39;19","00;27;41;06","like art of memory"
"00;27;41;06","00;27;42;01","in terms of like"
"00;27;42;01","00;27;45;02","it can be like part of the way we"
"00;27;45;02","00;27;47;03","access and organize"
"00;27;47;03","00;27;48;23","the information we work with"
"00;27;48;23","00;27;49;25","when we're thinking"
"00;27;49;25","00;27;51;28","is through a kind of spatial zation of"
"00;27;51;29","00;27;53;24","and actually like to the extent"
"00;27;53;24","00;27;54;06","that we show"
"00;27;54;06","00;27;55;20","like really great virtuosity"
"00;27;55;20","00;27;56;10","with memory,"
"00;27;56;10","00;27;56;21","it's through"
"00;27;56;21","00;27;58;20","an explicit process of space"
"00;27;58;20","00;28;00;24","analyzing and navigating through domain."
"00;28;00;24","00;28;02;18","And that gives us like"
"00;28;02;18","00;28;04;10","the best purchase we have on,"
"00;28;05;11","00;28;06;05","you know,"
"00;28;06;05","00;28;07;01","remembering these"
"00;28;07;01","00;28;08;17","building constructions"
"00;28;08;17","00;28;11;02","and accessing these complex structures."
"00;28;11;02","00;28;12;03","But in terms of"
"00;28;12;03","00;28;12;25","like what you're describing is"
"00;28;12;25","00;28;13;16","like something"
"00;28;13;16","00;28;16;02","kind of like Jennifer Anderson or like"
"00;28;17;11","00;28;19;17","neurons are like to kind of finding"
"00;28;21;26","00;28;22;17","the things come to mind."
"00;28;22;17","00;28;24;08","There's like foraging theory."
"00;28;24;08","00;28;25;26","And so what you might be foraging"
"00;28;25;26","00;28;26;13","for like"
"00;28;26;13","00;28;26;24","when you're like"
"00;28;26;24","00;28;27;06","looking for"
"00;28;27;06","00;28;27;25","like something"
"00;28;27;25","00;28;28;26","that fits"
"00;28;28;26","00;28;32;24","is a certain amount of like familiarity"
"00;28;33;04","00;28;35;17","or like some amount of like"
"00;28;35;17","00;28;37;03","it could take different forms like,"
"00;28;37;03","00;28;38;24","you know, some sort of."
"00;28;38;24","00;28;40;23","Yeah, maybe, maybe it's"
"00;28;40;23","00;28;42;01","anti receptive code."
"00;28;42;01","00;28;42;10","It's like,"
"00;28;42;10","00;28;44;28","like a visceral feeling of like"
"00;28;44;28","00;28;45;21","comparing this"
"00;28;45;21","00;28;46;25","or maybe it's like a"
"00;28;46;25","00;28;48;12","more appropriate set of code"
"00;28;48;12","00;28;49;20","and like tension in the body."
"00;28;49;20","00;28;51;13","I don't know what it might be, but like"
"00;28;52;12","00;28;52;23","there's some"
"00;28;52;23","00;28;55;07","sort of read you're having"
"00;28;55;27","00;28;58;02","and are you finding"
"00;28;58;02","00;28;59;13","what you're looking for"
"00;28;59;13","00;29;00;19","and suddenly there'd be like,"
"00;29;00;19","00;29;01;24","you're foraging for it."
"00;29;01;24","00;29;02;18","And so you might spend"
"00;29;02;18","00;29;03;27","a little bit of time"
"00;29;03;27","00;29;06;28","in some area of conceptual space"
"00;29;07;06","00;29;07;20","and you're kind"
"00;29;07;20","00;29;09;01","of moving around in there,"
"00;29;09;01","00;29;11;01","like trying out different permutations."
"00;29;11;01","00;29;12;24","And then like now I'm not finding it."
"00;29;12;24","00;29;13;12","And then you might do"
"00;29;13;12","00;29;14;27","like a different tech"
"00;29;14;27","00;29;15;24","and then move to another"
"00;29;15;24","00;29;18;10","area of semantic or conceptual space"
"00;29;18;20","00;29;19;24","and you're searching around there."
"00;29;19;24","00;29;20;21","And so like"
"00;29;20;21","00;29;22;25","and foraging theory, these we call them,"
"00;29;23;00","00;29;24;23","I believe luvvie flights."
"00;29;24;23","00;29;25;17","And so there's like a"
"00;29;25;17","00;29;25;25","something"
"00;29;25;25","00;29;27;19","called the Marginal Value Theorem,"
"00;29;27;19","00;29;28;17","which is like if you're trying"
"00;29;28;17","00;29;31;07","to be an optimal forager"
"00;29;31;24","00;29;33;09","you're trying to balance exploration"
"00;29;33;09","00;29;34;15","and exploitation."
"00;29;34;15","00;29;35;29","And so you don't want to spend too"
"00;29;35;29","00;29;37;20","long in a given like patch"
"00;29;38;29","00;29;40;29","if it's not having what you want."
"00;29;40;29","00;29;43;21","But you don't want to leave a patch"
"00;29;43;21","00;29;44;09","prematurely"
"00;29;44;09","00;29;46;11","if it's a good patch to be exploited."
"00;29;46;22","00;29;47;09","And so the idea is"
"00;29;47;09","00;29;48;04","like if you're looking"
"00;29;48;04","00;29;49;01","for like"
"00;29;49;01","00;29;50;16","searching for a name or something"
"00;29;50;16","00;29;51;05","that fits"
"00;29;51;05","00;29;53;07","it might take the form of this"
"00;29;53;07","00;29;55;05","kind of like generalized foraging."
"00;29;55;05","00;29;57;16","But instead of you like locomote"
"00;29;57;16","00;29;58;25","in three spaces,"
"00;29;58;25","00;29;59;23","you're actually"
"00;29;59;23","00;30;00;29","spending different amounts"
"00;30;00;29","00;30;02;24","of time in semantic spaces"
"00;30;02;24","00;30;04;24","and then shifting based on"
"00;30;04;24","00;30;05;17","whether you think"
"00;30;05;17","00;30;08;11","you're actually it's like a juicy patch."
"00;30;09;05","00;30;09;20","And so like"
"00;30;09;20","00;30;10;22","the marginal value differences"
"00;30;10;22","00;30;12;00","like if your current rate"
"00;30;12;00","00;30;13;01","of foraging drops"
"00;30;13;01","00;30;14;27","below the historical return,"
"00;30;14;27","00;30;16;10","then you should,"
"00;30;16;27","00;30;18;06","then you should go."
"00;30;18;24","00;30;20;02","And so this like"
"00;30;20;02","00;30;20;22","there might be different"
"00;30;20;22","00;30;22;12","like inductive biases in the brain"
"00;30;22;12","00;30;23;04","that would represent this"
"00;30;23;04","00;30;25;10","like from a campus system."
"00;30;25;10","00;30;27;02","This might look like for instance, like"
"00;30;28;23","00;30;29;02","the way"
"00;30;29;02","00;30;32;02","by cloud is like you might get like this"
"00;30;32;02","00;30;33;28","pretty dictionary air drops below"
"00;30;33;28","00;30;35;17","a certain amount"
"00;30;35;24","00;30;37;15","or goes past a certain amount"
"00;30;37;15","00;30;39;07","and then hippocampal system"
"00;30;39;07","00;30;40;19","like ramps up with a lot of recurrent"
"00;30;40;19","00;30;42;15","activity is called like a ripple"
"00;30;42;15","00;30;44;17","and then it resets itself"
"00;30;44;17","00;30;47;01","and like retail space and like"
"00;30;47;01","00;30;49;11","stimulates cortex and like a new like"
"00;30;49;11","00;30;50;24","set of operative"
"00;30;50;24","00;30;54;13","policies and spatial relations"
"00;30;54;13","00;30;55;12","might occur."
"00;30;55;12","00;30;56;02","And so like"
"00;30;56;02","00;30;56;29","this would be like an example"
"00;30;56;29","00;30;57;21","of like a mechanism"
"00;30;57;21","00;30;58;20","like hippocampus"
"00;30;58;20","00;30;59;01","is going to have"
"00;30;59;01","00;30;59;29","like a built in mechanism"
"00;30;59;29","00;31;00;21","for like"
"00;31;00;25","00;31;02;23","these like attentional shift and shifts"
"00;31;02;23","00;31;03;26","in these imagine of shifts"
"00;31;03;26","00;31;05;13","when you're doing foraging,"
"00;31;05;13","00;31;06;06","it might be reflected"
"00;31;06;06","00;31;08;08","also like other ways, like a dopamine."
"00;31;08;21","00;31;10;14","So there's like some thoughts on"
"00;31;10;14","00;31;11;09","like Nathaniel,"
"00;31;11;09","00;31;12;13","let's talk about like"
"00;31;12;13","00;31;14;02","one way of interpreting opponent C"
"00;31;14;02","00;31;15;08","between like physic and tonic."
"00;31;15;08","00;31;17;13","Dopamine would be like"
"00;31;17;13","00;31;18;25","the tonic would tell you"
"00;31;18;25","00;31;20;06","like what's your average return?"
"00;31;20;06","00;31;21;12","Basically"
"00;31;21;15","00;31;22;03","and there seems to be"
"00;31;22;03","00;31;23;22","like a kind of functional alt."
"00;31;23;22","00;31;24;19","It's not antagonism,"
"00;31;24;19","00;31;26;28","but like the more your tonic is high,"
"00;31;27;15","00;31;29;13","the more you're"
"00;31;29;13","00;31;30;11","the less impactful"
"00;31;30;11","00;31;32;05","any face like event is."
"00;31;32;05","00;31;33;17","And so it would be kind of like"
"00;31;34;28","00;31;35;25","if you're"
"00;31;35;25","00;31;37;00","foraging, like what"
"00;31;37;00","00;31;39;17","would occasion a shift or not?"
"00;31;39;17","00;31;40;27","You might actually see this"
"00;31;40;27","00;31;41;16","like playing out"
"00;31;41;16","00;31;43;18","like in the way neuro modulators work."
"00;31;44;04","00;31;45;07","And so"
"00;31;45;11","00;31;46;19","I don't know if I like helps a lot,"
"00;31;46;19","00;31;47;19","but the idea is like"
"00;31;47;19","00;31;50;05","this is the sort of like"
"00;31;50;05","00;31;51;12","thinking in terms of foraging"
"00;31;51;12","00;31;54;00","or navigation to generalized spaces"
"00;31;54;00","00;31;56;17","as basically being"
"00;31;56;28","00;31;58;09","so the reason like,"
"00;31;58;09","00;31;58;23","you know,"
"00;31;58;24","00;32;01;04","so I guess there's like a kind of like"
"00;32;01;04","00;32;02;04","apriori reason."
"00;32;02;04","00;32;04;19","Like you would expect it to be"
"00;32;04;26","00;32;05;18","generally good,"
"00;32;05;18","00;32;08;09","which is doesn't everything like"
"00;32;08;09","00;32;09;26","in most of the things you encounter"
"00;32;09;26","00;32;11;12","do indeed exist in spaces?"
"00;32;11;12","00;32;12;03","And then most things,"
"00;32;12;03","00;32;12;28","the way we understand"
"00;32;12;28","00;32;14;13","them is by like specializing them,"
"00;32;14;13","00;32;15;14","it's like we grow them."
"00;32;15;14","00;32;17;17","We, we do like multidimensional scale"
"00;32;17;17","00;32;18;11","and we do different things"
"00;32;18;11","00;32;19;12","to try to like"
"00;32;19;18","00;32;20;25","it's just like a way"
"00;32;20;25","00;32;22;11","we understand things."
"00;32;22;11","00;32;24;17","But it also seems like this was probably"
"00;32;25;00","00;32;26;00","both evolutionarily"
"00;32;26;00","00;32;26;23","and developmentally"
"00;32;26;23","00;32;28;28","like this was the original challenge"
"00;32;28;28","00;32;30;17","that had to be solved"
"00;32;30;17","00;32;31;12","where the systems"
"00;32;31;12","00;32;32;25","were paying their weight"
"00;32;32;25","00;32;33;23","and that this would"
"00;32;33;23","00;32;35;27","then involve like a repurposing"
"00;32;35;27","00;32;37;28","and or redeploying for"
"00;32;37;28","00;32;39;07","more abstract domains."
"00;32;40;07","00;32;40;15","So like"
"00;32;40;15","00;32;40;28","there's some"
"00;32;40;28","00;32;43;06","other like I think it's Burgess"
"00;32;44;09","00;32;45;09","has done some good work"
"00;32;45;09","00;32;47;00","like finding like for instance, like"
"00;32;47;00","00;32;48;27","we might create like amorphous space"
"00;32;48;27","00;32;50;23","and we're like looking like,"
"00;32;50;23","00;32;51;13","like they'll create"
"00;32;51;13","00;32;52;22","like these generative"
"00;32;52;22","00;32;53;18","like birds"
"00;32;53;18","00;32;54;29","with like different like neck lengths"
"00;32;54;29","00;32;57;22","and you're trying to do like categories"
"00;32;57;22","00;32;58;14","over like what"
"00;32;58;14","00;33;00;09","the different kinds of birds are."
"00;33;00;09","00;33;01;09","And there's,"
"00;33;01;09","00;33;01;22","there's evidence"
"00;33;01;22","00;33;02;21","that like the way we do"
"00;33;02;21","00;33;05;17","the categorization is we'll create a,"
"00;33;06;02","00;33;08;17","a specialization of this task structure"
"00;33;09;09","00;33;11;16","and there's some others that have"
"00;33;11;16","00;33;12;04","a couple system"
"00;33;12;04","00;33;12;22","is we're"
"00;33;12;22","00;33;13;29","navigating through that"
"00;33;13;29","00;33;17;03","and dealing with these categories."
"00;33;17;03","00;33;18;01","And so that's"
"00;33;18;01","00;33;18;28","that was a lot of rambling."
"00;33;18;28","00;33;21;25","But like, I don't know if that got to"
"00;33;23;23","00;33;25;04","any of that land or."
"00;33;25;04","00;33;26;09","Yeah, lots of it land."
"00;33;26;09","00;33;27;24","It is very cool. Thank you. OK,"
"00;33;29;16","00;33;30;09","one note that"
"00;33;30;09","00;33;32;09","will I'm sure, be exploring"
"00;33;32;09","00;33;33;02","going forward."
"00;33;33;02","00;33;34;29","Optimal foraging theory is often"
"00;33;34;29","00;33;37;01","put in the context of utility,"
"00;33;37;15","00;33;40;09","which is just the pragmatic components"
"00;33;40;17","00;33;41;20","in active inference"
"00;33;41;20","00;33;43;08","in terms of policy selection."
"00;33;43;08","00;33;46;00","So optimal active inference foraging"
"00;33;46;07","00;33;46;24","is like"
"00;33;46;24","00;33;48;07","when the epistemic"
"00;33;48;07","00;33;49;22","and the pragmatic"
"00;33;49;22","00;33;51;06","gain are being considered."
"00;33;51;06","00;33;52;13","So that's quite interesting."
"00;33;52;13","00;33;54;11","And then also there's"
"00;33;54;11","00;33;55;01","as you brought up"
"00;33;55;01","00;33;57;25","individual and collective navigation"
"00;33;57;25","00;34;01;10","and so one case is sort of the sovereign"
"00;34;01;10","00;34;02;22","robot, no"
"00;34;02;22","00;34;03;27","Wi-Fi"
"00;34;03;27","00;34;05;07","onboard computation"
"00;34;05;07","00;34;07;03","alone in the warehouse."
"00;34;07;03","00;34;08;11","But then in the case of,"
"00;34;08;11","00;34;10;12","for example, an ant colony"
"00;34;10;21","00;34;11;21","where there's stigma"
"00;34;11;21","00;34;14;04","and modification of the environment"
"00;34;14;04","00;34;16;24","that might be possible"
"00;34;16;24","00;34;18;04","or even facilitated"
"00;34;18;04","00;34;20;02","by different onboard cognition"
"00;34;20;02","00;34;22;07","and different outsourced or offloaded,"
"00;34;22;07","00;34;23;24","which brings us to extended"
"00;34;23;24","00;34;26;03","cognitive discussions."
"00;34;26;03","00;34;28;02","But let's return to this question"
"00;34;28;02","00;34;30;00","about going from"
"00;34;30;00","00;34;32;03","this resiliency of navigation"
"00;34;32;11","00;34;35;16","that a biologist knows exist."
"00;34;35;23","00;34;37;29","A roboticist might want to see."
"00;34;38;18","00;34;41;22","How did you then go to that third space"
"00;34;42;11","00;34;46;01","and actually have a hierarchical model"
"00;34;46;06","00;34;49;00","so here in figure two or wherever"
"00;34;49;00","00;34;50;14","else, you suggest"
"00;34;50;14","00;34;52;16","what is happening here?"
"00;34;52;16","00;34;55;23","And how did this graphical structure"
"00;34;55;23","00;34;56;25","come to be as opposed"
"00;34;56;25","00;34;57;14","to potentially"
"00;34;57;14","00;34;59;01","like other graphical structures that"
"00;34;59;01","00;34;59;27","could have been used"
"00;35;03;16","00;35;04;06","so"
"00;35;05;19","00;35;06;27","basically"
"00;35;09;02","00;35;11;11","let me first maybe explain"
"00;35;11;11","00;35;13;02","all the variables in this"
"00;35;13;02","00;35;14;07","in this figure."
"00;35;14;07","00;35;15;15","So"
"00;35;16;19","00;35;18;15","going from the bottom"
"00;35;18;15","00;35;19;11","to up"
"00;35;19;11","00;35;22;05","at the bottom, we have the both of these"
"00;35;22;22","00;35;24;08","which are basically observations."
"00;35;24;08","00;35;25;16","So these are like"
"00;35;25;16","00;35;26;22","the visual inputs"
"00;35;26;22","00;35;28;23","that what the robot thinks is"
"00;35;30;21","00;35;33;03","and then we have to"
"00;35;33;03","00;35;35;15","leave them variables s and P."
"00;35;36;10","00;35;39;01","S is basically"
"00;35;39;01","00;35;41;06","an estimation of"
"00;35;42;08","00;35;43;25","all the different factors"
"00;35;43;25","00;35;46;14","that give rise to the observation."
"00;35;46;15","00;35;48;03","So this is it's kind of a"
"00;35;48;03","00;35;50;23","belief in space that the film finds"
"00;35;51;01","00;35;53;18","all possible visual observations."
"00;35;54;12","00;35;56;26","And B, on the other hand,"
"00;35;56;26","00;36;00;04","is the leading variable that's"
"00;36;00;04","00;36;02;21","has a representation of, of your force,"
"00;36;02;22","00;36;05;00","which is then basically"
"00;36;05;26","00;36;07;22","in this case"
"00;36;07;26","00;36;09;25","your your ex wife"
"00;36;09;25","00;36;13;11","position and direction"
"00;36;13;24","00;36;15;15","and there we go,"
"00;36;15;16","00;36;16;14","we have one more,"
"00;36;16;14","00;36;18;12","which is the need action."
"00;36;18;12","00;36;20;07","And so that's what I hinted at"
"00;36;22;04","00;36;23;00","previously."
"00;36;23;00","00;36;24;18","This is basically your,"
"00;36;24;18","00;36;26;18","your proprioception, you know,"
"00;36;27;10","00;36;29;08","you know, what you have been doing."
"00;36;29;08","00;36;33;01","So there, there for up until the past"
"00;36;33;21","00;36;35;26","the eighties are also shaded."
"00;36;35;26","00;36;36;19","So it means that"
"00;36;36;19","00;36;39;21","you basically have access to"
"00;36;39;21","00;36;40;23","what you have been doing."
"00;36;40;23","00;36;42;15","It's like the low level action,"
"00;36;42;15","00;36;44;28","like move forward to this philosophy,"
"00;36;44;28","00;36;46;17","alternate for life,"
"00;36;46;17","00;36;47;18","but then for the future"
"00;36;47;18","00;36;49;16","this becomes an observer thing"
"00;36;49;16","00;36;51;26","and you basically want to infer"
"00;36;51;26","00;36;52;29","potential actions"
"00;36;52;29","00;36;55;04","you should be doing in the future."
"00;36;56;27","00;36;58;29","And then for the future,"
"00;36;59;28","00;37;02;10","the number of actions can be just"
"00;37;03;05","00;37;05;16","summarized spy, which is then"
"00;37;05;16","00;37;06;04","the policy."
"00;37;06;04","00;37;08;05","So the policy is no more than"
"00;37;08;05","00;37;09;24","the sequence of future actions"
"00;37;09;24","00;37;11;28","that you that you"
"00;37;11;28","00;37;12;28","that you want to do,"
"00;37;12;28","00;37;13;22","that you intend to do,"
"00;37;15;12","00;37;15;28","and then"
"00;37;15;28","00;37;17;28","you move up the level in the hierarchy"
"00;37;18;25","00;37;21;00","and there"
"00;37;21;03","00;37;22;23","and through more variables."
"00;37;22;23","00;37;24;29","One is the location."
"00;37;25;05","00;37;28;15","Oh, and this is then basically kind of a"
"00;37;28;17","00;37;30;27","more green"
"00;37;33;13","00;37;34;04","yeah."
"00;37;34;13","00;37;36;16","Look, representation of location,"
"00;37;36;16","00;37;37;19","where am I?"
"00;37;37;19","00;37;39;12","But it's not really"
"00;37;39;12","00;37;40;26","it's not necessarily sides"
"00;37;40;26","00;37;42;12","to a metric space."
"00;37;42;12","00;37;44;07","It's just like identify"
"00;37;44;07","00;37;45;26","this is a location."
"00;37;45;26","00;37;48;00","And then we have"
"00;37;48;15","00;37;50;28","also an action space at this level."
"00;37;51;10","00;37;54;22","But this is the more we call this moves"
"00;37;54;23","00;37;57;16","or M and the move is basically kind of"
"00;37;58;17","00;38;00;26","moving from one location to another."
"00;38;00;26","00;38;01;23","So locations"
"00;38;01;23","00;38;03;07","can just be more coarse"
"00;38;03;07","00;38;06;09","grains like what you"
"00;38;07;07","00;38;08;07","what you define"
"00;38;08;07","00;38;08;18","as like"
"00;38;08;18","00;38;11;28","a separate location in your environment."
"00;38;12;28","00;38;16;19","Whereas at the lower level, the states,"
"00;38;16;19","00;38;17;28","if you move from one states"
"00;38;17;28","00;38;18;29","to the other,"
"00;38;18;29","00;38;20;05","it's basically just saying,"
"00;38;20;05","00;38;22;16","OK, what would be the next frame"
"00;38;22;16","00;38;24;20","of my camera sensor, if you like?"
"00;38;24;20","00;38;26;08","And so it's also crucial to know"
"00;38;26;08","00;38;27;10","that these two levels"
"00;38;27;10","00;38;28;20","operate on different"
"00;38;28;20","00;38;30;04","kind of time scales."
"00;38;30;04","00;38;32;02","So the lowest level"
"00;38;32;02","00;38;34;09","time scale is basically your very fine,"
"00;38;34;28","00;38;35;25","fine grained"
"00;38;36;25","00;38;38;00","action perception loop."
"00;38;38;00","00;38;40;04","I, I send the motor commands"
"00;38;40;15","00;38;41;08","through the robots"
"00;38;41;08","00;38;43;10","and I resolve my camera"
"00;38;43;10","00;38;45;17","and this can go through."
"00;38;45;23","00;38;47;06","I think we implemented that"
"00;38;47;06","00;38;49;15","like ten versus ten times per second"
"00;38;49;15","00;38;51;18","the newcomer frames updated"
"00;38;51;18","00;38;53;04","the motor command,"
"00;38;53;04","00;38;56;10","various locations just like and moving"
"00;38;56;10","00;38;57;07","from one location"
"00;38;57;07","00;38;58;03","to another again"
"00;38;58;03","00;39;02;08","can take you maybe ten or more times."
"00;39;02;08","00;39;04;09","That's at the lower level."
"00;39;04;18","00;39;05;13","And then of course"
"00;39;05;13","00;39;08;04","one of the crucial bits is then"
"00;39;08;04","00;39;10;20","when when do you"
"00;39;10;20","00;39;11;19","how do you then"
"00;39;11;19","00;39;13;26","how do you identify a location?"
"00;39;14;21","00;39;17;08","And so basically how it comes to be"
"00;39;17;08","00;39;18;21","is that if you you"
"00;39;18;21","00;39;21;05","you basically observe your right"
"00;39;21;23","00;39;23;29","your space through the camera images,"
"00;39;24;13","00;39;27;01","we can infer this abstract states space"
"00;39;28;01","00;39;29;06","and then we look at some"
"00;39;29;06","00;39;32;11","what what is the surprise of being"
"00;39;32;11","00;39;34;22","in the states versus"
"00;39;34;22","00;39;35;29","what they predicted."
"00;39;35;29","00;39;37;12","And if this supports"
"00;39;37;12","00;39;38;26","is like a certain threshold."
"00;39;40;02","00;39;42;05","So yeah, it's"
"00;39;42;05","00;39;44;29","a pretty complex move to to explain,"
"00;39;44;29","00;39;45;22","but I'll do my best."
"00;39;45;22","00;39;48;05","So every time everything's step"
"00;39;48;18","00;39;50;24","you get basically a new camera image"
"00;39;51;03","00;39;53;12","and you can go too late like what is"
"00;39;53;20","00;39;55;15","what is the divergence between"
"00;39;55;15","00;39;57;06","what I was thinking about"
"00;39;57;06","00;39;58;25","the state previously"
"00;39;58;25","00;40;01;07","and how does that how did that shift"
"00;40;01;21","00;40;03;09","with my new observation"
"00;40;03;09","00;40;05;18","is that of the Bayesian surprise"
"00;40;05;18","00;40;06;18","that you have"
"00;40;06;18","00;40;08;16","from studying this observation"
"00;40;08;16","00;40;10;23","and everything that we accumulate"
"00;40;10;23","00;40;12;07","like this number"
"00;40;12;07","00;40;15;02","and once we follow a certain threshold,"
"00;40;15;02","00;40;16;25","which is kind of hard for me to read"
"00;40;16;25","00;40;17;20","just speaks of the"
"00;40;17;20","00;40;19;28","something that seems to work"
"00;40;19;28","00;40;21;08","if you suppose this threshold"
"00;40;21;08","00;40;22;21","to basically say, OK,"
"00;40;22;21","00;40;24;24","this is now this thing to know"
"00;40;24;24","00;40;27;06","and timestamp before"
"00;40;27;06","00;40;28;18","so it must be something new,"
"00;40;28;18","00;40;30;21","it must be a new kind of"
"00;40;30;21","00;40;32;14","location in my neck."
"00;40;32;14","00;40;34;16","And then you add this"
"00;40;34;16","00;40;35;21","thing as this thing,"
"00;40;35;21","00;40;37;21","this thing to location then your map"
"00;40;37;21","00;40;39;13","and you add like the link"
"00;40;39;13","00;40;41;14","from the previous location to this one"
"00;40;41;28","00;40;42;21","and you start"
"00;40;42;21","00;40;44;09","and then you continue further"
"00;40;44;09","00;40;46;11","on building the map"
"00;40;46;11","00;40;47;05","and this is how you"
"00;40;47;05","00;40;48;13","then kind of create"
"00;40;48;13","00;40;49;23","this more course grain"
"00;40;52;08","00;40;52;27","map of your"
"00;40;52;27","00;40;55;29","environment and,"
"00;40;56;04","00;40;58;14","and you can then reason"
"00;40;58;14","00;41;00;04","like how should I move"
"00;41;00;04","00;41;02;11","from this location to another"
"00;41;02;11","00;41;02;19","and you"
"00;41;02;19","00;41;03;06","then can,"
"00;41;03;06","00;41;06;16","you can then basically use your,"
"00;41;06;16","00;41;07;09","your previous"
"00;41;07;09","00;41;09;17","you visit locations and moves together."
"00;41;09;18","00;41;11;10","I have a model of"
"00;41;11;10","00;41;13;12","how can I move in this space,"
"00;41;13;16","00;41;15;20","but at the more great level, moving"
"00;41;15;20","00;41;18;05","from one location to another."
"00;41;18;22","00;41;21;08","And it also means that by by"
"00;41;21;08","00;41;23;05","using this surprise"
"00;41;23;05","00;41;25;05","on the first meeting space"
"00;41;25;05","00;41;27;27","that we infer from from visual input,"
"00;41;28;17","00;41;31;19","it means that it's not not every edge"
"00;41;32;02","00;41;34;27","has the same distance in real space."
"00;41;35;02","00;41;36;19","So so if you're"
"00;41;36;19","00;41;38;27","if the robot is reversing"
"00;41;38;27","00;41;42;21","a white hallway where the walls"
"00;41;42;21","00;41;43;26","are perfectly white"
"00;41;43;26","00;41;44;14","and everything"
"00;41;44;14","00;41;46;15","that everything's the same,"
"00;41;46;15","00;41;48;01","then it will take a long time"
"00;41;48;01","00;41;50;06","for this special to be reached."
"00;41;50;06","00;41;52;09","And it will only have"
"00;41;53;09","00;41;54;12","larger distances."
"00;41;54;12","00;41;55;11","Make a new node"
"00;41;55;11","00;41;56;06","because everything looks"
"00;41;56;06","00;41;57;02","the same anyway."
"00;41;57;02","00;41;58;29","So there's no extra information"
"00;41;58;29","00;42;01;08","that I need to put in the map."
"00;42;01;08","00;42;03;26","But if you then suddenly"
"00;42;03;26","00;42;05;19","see a door, for example,"
"00;42;05;19","00;42;06;27","then you're suddenly"
"00;42;06;27","00;42;09;00","reach your threshold, then you add a new"
"00;42;11;17","00;42;13;02","location in your map."
"00;42;13;02","00;42;14;06","So it's basically"
"00;42;14;06","00;42;15;12","the locations in the map"
"00;42;15;12","00;42;17;14","or basically the final on"
"00;42;18;03","00;42;19;10","what is the information"
"00;42;19;10","00;42;21;12","I got by looking at this thing"
"00;42;21;22","00;42;23;14","rather than"
"00;42;23;14","00;42;25;23","how much meters that I traverse"
"00;42;26;11","00;42;29;08","in this in this thing and this makes it"
"00;42;29;09","00;42;30;21","a really"
"00;42;30;21","00;42;33;06","interesting way of representing maps"
"00;42;33;06","00;42;34;19","because it's more like"
"00;42;34;19","00;42;37;18","how much information is there"
"00;42;37;18","00;42;40;08","in this particular location rather than"
"00;42;41;19","00;42;43;22","which x y look position?"
"00;42;43;22","00;42;45;28","Is this your"
"00;42;47;02","00;42;50;12","does does it make sense"
"00;42;51;04","00;42;51;27","yeah."
"00;42;52;04","00;42;55;04","And it feels to map"
"00;42;55;04","00;42;56;17","onto the distinction"
"00;42;56;17","00;42;58;17","between like Chronos and Kairos,"
"00;42;58;29","00;43;00;12","like in this analogy,"
"00;43;00;12","00;43;03;06","here, Chronos is the chronometer, it's"
"00;43;03;06","00;43;03;21","the watch"
"00;43;03;21","00;43;04;10","time, it's"
"00;43;04;10","00;43;05;22","the geometry, it's the x"
"00;43;05;22","00;43;07;20","y grid, it's one meter."
"00;43;07;20","00;43;09;06","And then Kairos is like"
"00;43;09;06","00;43;11;04","the timeliness of action in the time"
"00;43;11;04","00;43;13;01","it takes to complete an action."
"00;43;13;01","00;43;15;25","And then something being like boring"
"00;43;16;01","00;43;16;20","that's going"
"00;43;16;20","00;43;19;14","through a low information hallway"
"00;43;19;24","00;43;21;06","in the cognitive foraging."
"00;43;21;06","00;43;23;01","It's like, are we there yet?"
"00;43;23;01","00;43;24;14","Driving through this"
"00;43;24;14","00;43;25;27","featureless landscape"
"00;43;25;27","00;43;28;00","where the salience is low"
"00;43;28;00","00;43;29;02","because my predictions"
"00;43;29;02","00;43;32;28","are basically being met almost too well,"
"00;43;33;10","00;43;34;24","and there's a lot of other"
"00;43;36;04","00;43;38;05","ways to go with it."
"00;43;38;10","00;43;39;11","Adam, anything to add?"
"00;43;39;11","00;43;40;04","And also, again,"
"00;43;40;04","00;43;41;16","I'm just kind of curious, like,"
"00;43;41;16","00;43;43;14","what is the space of the possible"
"00;43;43;14","00;43;45;05","graphical structures?"
"00;43;45;05","00;43;48;01","Do you think that this is the only or"
"00;43;48;01","00;43;49;28","the sort of grandfather"
"00;43;49;28","00;43;50;28","graphical model"
"00;43;50;28","00;43;52;12","for hierarchical navigation?"
"00;43;52;12","00;43;53;21","Like how do we go from"
"00;43;53;21","00;43;56;22","imagining this tactics and strategy,"
"00;43;56;22","00;43;58;09","multilevel model"
"00;43;58;09","00;44;00;10","to a graphical model"
"00;44;00;10","00;44;01;22","that we believe will be consistent"
"00;44;01;22","00;44;02;18","with active inference"
"00;44;02;18","00;44;05;12","and amenable to message passing"
"00;44;06;11","00;44;09;14","and maybe to act on this last question,"
"00;44;10;25","00;44;13;11","I think Kristen has the as a paper"
"00;44;13;11","00;44;16;00","on some role models"
"00;44;16;13","00;44;17;28","where he basically lays out"
"00;44;17;28","00;44;18;25","more generic."
"00;44;18;25","00;44;19;20","So like"
"00;44;19;24","00;44;20;11","if you're looking"
"00;44;20;11","00;44;22;01","at the ultimate generic"
"00;44;22;01","00;44;23;27","hierarchical model, you'll find it."
"00;44;23;27","00;44;27;00","There is basically just an aggregation"
"00;44;27;00","00;44;31;02","of states that give rise to observations"
"00;44;32;05","00;44;32;25","that"
"00;44;34;07","00;44;35;28","go from one state to another"
"00;44;35;28","00;44;37;09","given the action."
"00;44;37;09","00;44;39;15","And then you can add the level of doctor"
"00;44;40;12","00;44;43;13","you can keep on adding levels."
"00;44;43;13","00;44;45;21","And that's kind of the prototypical"
"00;44;45;21","00;44;48;10","article model, I would say."
"00;44;48;10","00;44;50;03","And what we see here,"
"00;44;50;03","00;44;52;07","this kind of particular instantiation"
"00;44;52;18","00;44;55;11","where we took some"
"00;44;55;29","00;44;57;06","domain knowledge"
"00;44;57;06","00;44;58;07","like OK,"
"00;44;58;07","00;44;59;17","from every nation,"
"00;44;59;17","00;45;00;22","what would be sensible"
"00;45;00;22","00;45;02;08","levels to think about"
"00;45;02;08","00;45;04;08","and what would these"
"00;45;04;08","00;45;05;22","latent things then"
"00;45;05;22","00;45;07;08","what should they represent?"
"00;45;07;08","00;45;09;25","And then of course around"
"00;45;09;25","00;45;11;20","the end of like, OK,"
"00;45;11;20","00;45;12;25","at the lowest level,"
"00;45;12;25","00;45;14;25","I need to have some state"
"00;45;14;25","00;45;16;27","that represents my images."
"00;45;17;09","00;45;19;04","And at the higher level,"
"00;45;19;04","00;45;21;07","I want to have some locations in the map"
"00;45;22;15","00;45;24;21","and how do they then relate?"
"00;45;24;21","00;45;27;16","OK, I probably also want this, this,"
"00;45;27;21","00;45;28;28","this false integration."
"00;45;28;28","00;45;31;02","So maybe I need to have a"
"00;45;33;16","00;45;34;05","special first"
"00;45;34;05","00;45;34;11","couple"
"00;45;34;11","00;45;37;05","citizens here in the form of my folks."
"00;45;37;27","00;45;38;07","And that's"
"00;45;38;07","00;45;39;17","how you basically"
"00;45;39;17","00;45;40;26","build up the model"
"00;45;40;26","00;45;42;06","from first we have"
"00;45;42;06","00;45;44;19","this was difficult to model"
"00;45;44;19","00;45;45;15","then looking at."
"00;45;45;15","00;45;45;24","Yeah,"
"00;45;45;24","00;45;47;13","but in my case,"
"00;45;47;13","00;45;49;20","what do I think is sensible?"
"00;45;49;24","00;45;51;21","What could these things mean"
"00;45;51;21","00;45;53;23","and then try to figure out like, OK,"
"00;45;56;09","00;45;58;00","at this at this stage"
"00;45;58;00","00;46;00;16","we kind of converge on the one hand from"
"00;46;01;06","00;46;01;26","top down,"
"00;46;01;26","00;46;03;21","like does the math work out"
"00;46;03;21","00;46;04;14","through bottom up?"
"00;46;04;14","00;46;05;24","Does this match match"
"00;46;05;24","00;46;07;13","with my implementation?"
"00;46;07;13","00;46;08;13","And then at some point"
"00;46;08;13","00;46;10;14","we converge to do this basically."
"00;46;12;07","00;46;14;14","So the high road and the low road,"
"00;46;14;14","00;46;17;09","they do lead to Rome after all."
"00;46;17;09","00;46;18;05","Exactly."
"00;46;19;05","00;46;22;11","Adam, what would you add in there?"
"00;46;23;09","00;46;24;22","Well, first, I don't"
"00;46;26;07","00;46;28;08","I love that metaphor just now."
"00;46;28;08","00;46;30;10","And the another thing I would add is"
"00;46;32;19","00;46;33;21","so like, you know,"
"00;46;33;21","00;46;34;11","on my end,"
"00;46;34;11","00;46;38;02","like I'm trying to use this is like"
"00;46;38;08","00;46;39;23","abstractions for understanding,"
"00;46;39;23","00;46;40;13","you know,"
"00;46;40;15","00;46;41;26","aspects of like brain functioning."
"00;46;41;26","00;46;44;06","So let's say we're talking about these"
"00;46;47;02","00;46;49;19","you know, this top level."
"00;46;49;19","00;46;50;26","This is one way of interpreting"
"00;46;50;26","00;46;53;10","like the hippocampal place cells"
"00;46;55;04","00;46;57;13","and these"
"00;46;57;13","00;46;59;21","whether you create a new node or not,"
"00;46;59;21","00;47;00;11","based on what"
"00;47;00;11","00;47;02;23","threshold of familiarity or surprise"
"00;47;03;23","00;47;04;11","this would"
"00;47;04;11","00;47;05;19","potentially be like an example,"
"00;47;05;19","00;47;08;04","I think of"
"00;47;08;04","00;47;11;00","X, an extremely"
"00;47;11;00","00;47;11;26","powerful source"
"00;47;11;26","00;47;13;21","of individual differences"
"00;47;13;21","00;47;15;23","like maybe you could think of this"
"00;47;15;23","00;47;17;09","in terms of like positioning"
"00;47;17;09","00;47;19;19","and like assimilation or accommodation,"
"00;47;19;19","00;47;20;13","but you could see like"
"00;47;20;13","00;47;22;01","if your thresholds are too low"
"00;47;22;01","00;47;23;21","or too high,"
"00;47;23;21","00;47;24;11","you could end up"
"00;47;24;11","00;47;27;11","representing a domain in ways with"
"00;47;28;13","00;47;29;01","their other. Like"
"00;47;30;19","00;47;32;00","you can get false,"
"00;47;32;00","00;47;32;20","you can get"
"00;47;32;26","00;47;33;11","things that are"
"00;47;33;11","00;47;34;07","like excessively"
"00;47;34;07","00;47;36;14","granular or insufficiently granular"
"00;47;36;14","00;47;37;29","to represent the domain,"
"00;47;37;29","00;47;38;24","and you can get different"
"00;47;38;24","00;47;40;29","types of errors associated with it."
"00;47;40;29","00;47;41;18","And so like this,"
"00;47;41;18","00;47;44;07","for instance, could define"
"00;47;44;10","00;47;46;11","even the things like more like"
"00;47;46;11","00;47;47;25","some people are talking like autism"
"00;47;47;25","00;47;49;09","to schizophrenia spectrums."
"00;47;49;09","00;47;51;09","And so there could be like"
"00;47;51;14","00;47;52;11","kind of underlying"
"00;47;52;11","00;47;54;00","predispositions for this"
"00;47;54;00","00;47;55;15","it might actually be."
"00;47;55;15","00;47;57;05","I think that's an oversimplification."
"00;47;57;05","00;48;00;02","But you could think of these thresholds"
"00;48;00;03","00;48;01;27","as some cognitive spectrum."
"00;48;01;27","00;48;03;16","This might just fall out of them."
"00;48;03;16","00;48;04;28","As you get different types of minds."
"00;48;04;28","00;48;06;19","If you have like a more granular,"
"00;48;06;19","00;48;07;29","like an overly inclusive"
"00;48;07;29","00;48;09;08","or an utterly inclusive"
"00;48;09;08","00;48;10;27","category structure."
"00;48;10;27","00;48;13;04","But some other things like just trying"
"00;48;13;04","00;48;14;20","and this would be like if we're"
"00;48;14;20","00;48;16;03","talking about this,"
"00;48;17;08","00;48;18;18","you know, lower level"
"00;48;18;18","00;48;20;14","and if we're thinking of like these"
"00;48;20;14","00;48;22;02","like internal grid cells"
"00;48;22;02","00;48;24;28","as well, not quite being well,"
"00;48;24;28","00;48;26;19","the posts here are like red cells,"
"00;48;26;19","00;48;29;09","but this idea of like"
"00;48;29;09","00;48;30;11","this"
"00;48;32;10","00;48;35;21","mapping of your"
"00;48;38;24","00;48;40;05","what your body position is"
"00;48;40;05","00;48;42;05","and where you're oriented"
"00;48;42;05","00;48;44;13","and then having this conjoined"
"00;48;44;13","00;48;46;04","with what's"
"00;48;46;04","00;48;47;06","in your visual field"
"00;48;47;06","00;48;48;12","and then using these sources"
"00;48;48;12","00;48;49;28","of information"
"00;48;50;03","00;48;51;15","to mutually constrain each other"
"00;48;51;15","00;48;54;22","and using where you are in space"
"00;48;55;00","00;48;56;25","and these all being necessary"
"00;48;56;25","00;48;57;16","for instance,"
"00;48;57;16","00;48;59;07","this seems to be fundamentally"
"00;48;59;07","00;48;59;27","what was needed"
"00;48;59;27","00;49;01;22","to get the robots to work."
"00;49;01;22","00;49;03;14","And we have not so"
"00;49;03;14","00;49;05;20","dissimilar sensors in effectors"
"00;49;05;20","00;49;08;20","and so once I was"
"00;49;08;20","00;49;11;06","you know, I think it's"
"00;49;11;06","00;49;12;08","got a"
"00;49;13;03","00;49;15;17","tumor has just messed up his name"
"00;49;16;22","00;49;17;08","but"
"00;49;19;06","00;49;20;28","he has this interesting paper"
"00;49;20;28","00;49;22;23","and like default mode system"
"00;49;22;23","00;49;24;28","as it's called a dark control"
"00;49;24;28","00;49;25;15","and thinking of it"
"00;49;25;15","00;49;27;29","as doing like tree search. But"
"00;49;30;19","00;49;32;08","to loop it around"
"00;49;32;16","00;49;34;15","this pose information, it's"
"00;49;34;15","00;49;34;27","somewhat like"
"00;49;34;27","00;49;35;20","the posterior"
"00;49;35;20","00;49;37;27","nodes of the demon are actually helping"
"00;49;37;27","00;49;41;17","to encode this information"
"00;49;41;24","00;49;42;14","like if you go like"
"00;49;42;14","00;49;43;18","to the parietal portions"
"00;49;43;18","00;49;44;27","that actually might be"
"00;49;44;27","00;49;47;01","where is my body where it's reflected."
"00;49;47;01","00;49;48;12","And then if you're going like"
"00;49;48;12","00;49;51;20","to these midline portions of it,"
"00;49;51;20","00;49;54;07","the you know, what's in my visual field"
"00;49;54;07","00;49;56;00","or what am I imagining?"
"00;49;56;00","00;49;57;02","And then if you want to go"
"00;49;57;02","00;49;59;03","for like this future part,"
"00;49;59;09","00;50;00;01","that might be like"
"00;50;00;01","00;50;02;16","the anterior portions."
"00;50;02;16","00;50;04;24","So like the demon or the"
"00;50;06;20","00;50;08;21","semiofficial cortex, maybe coupling"
"00;50;08;21","00;50;10;00","with the hippocampal anterior,"
"00;50;10;00","00;50;10;14","the campus,"
"00;50;10;14","00;50;12;26","but basically it would seem that"
"00;50;12;28","00;50;14;29","like the stream,"
"00;50;14;29","00;50;16;17","these core aspects of the model"
"00;50;16;17","00;50;17;05","might be ways"
"00;50;17;05","00;50;19;07","of functionally understanding"
"00;50;19;07","00;50;20;15","the core aspects"
"00;50;20;15","00;50;22;28","of an ancient architecture"
"00;50;23;17","00;50;27;01","used for mental stimulation"
"00;50;28;24","00;50;29;29","that there"
"00;50;29;29","00;50;30;18","just seems to be a"
"00;50;30;18","00;50;33;01","striking amount of convergence between"
"00;50;33;27","00;50;35;24","the things that people like"
"00;50;35;24","00;50;36;11","Tim are identifying"
"00;50;36;11","00;50;37;21","as just like what's necessary,"
"00;50;37;21","00;50;39;17","how do we solve a problem?"
"00;50;39;17","00;50;40;11","And the features"
"00;50;40;11","00;50;42;17","of neuronal organization"
"00;50;42;25","00;50;45;12","that would be these"
"00;50;45;12","00;50;48;19","two defaults or canonical processes"
"00;50;48;19","00;50;50;22","that you just you're seeing it as a"
"00;50;52;01","00;50;54;11","as really just fundamental you know,"
"00;50;55;04","00;50;56;20","we call it a default purposely"
"00;50;56;20","00;50;59;09","active all the time. What's it doing"
"00;50;59;09","00;51;00;26","maybe part of what it's doing"
"00;51;00;26","00;51;02;29","is it's allowing us to do"
"00;51;04;03","00;51;07;07","this kind of navigation through space"
"00;51;07;07","00;51;08;13","and time"
"00;51;10;18","00;51;11;01","yeah."
"00;51;11;01","00;51;13;04","So those are some touch"
"00;51;14;10","00;51;16;05","navigation through space"
"00;51;16;05","00;51;18;26","and time in these sort of territory."
"00;51;19;06","00;51;21;14","Sense would be clock time"
"00;51;21;14","00;51;24;19","and metric space what is your X-Y-Z T?"
"00;51;25;03","00;51;26;25","And then navigation through mental"
"00;51;26;25","00;51;27;24","space and time"
"00;51;28;27","00;51;30;21","might have some resonances"
"00;51;30;21","00;51;32;01","or analogies,"
"00;51;32;01","00;51;34;04","but it's not a piece of paper."
"00;51;34;25","00;51;37;00","So what is it and how does it"
"00;51;38;05","00;51;40;25","become realized through ecology,"
"00;51;40;25","00;51;42;00","evolution and development?"
"00;51;42;00","00;51;44;06","So awesome points. Thank you."
"00;51;44;06","00;51;44;29","Real quickly,"
"00;51;44;29","00;51;46;24","in terms of the time issue,"
"00;51;46;24","00;51;47;10","it seems like there's"
"00;51;47;10","00;51;49;05","these multiple ways the time comes in."
"00;51;49;05","00;51;50;00","It's like one sense"
"00;51;50;00","00;51;51;20","of like the sense of time"
"00;51;51;20","00;51;53;11","as you might be doing like accumulation"
"00;51;53;11","00;51;55;03","based on like"
"00;51;55;09","00;51;56;17","the frequency"
"00;51;56;17","00;51;57;03","with which you're"
"00;51;57;03","00;51;58;09","having like meaningful"
"00;51;58;09","00;52;00;08","informational events"
"00;52;00;08","00;52;01;10","like but Craig calls"
"00;52;01;10","00;52;04;07","these like global emotional moments,"
"00;52;04;07","00;52;07;00","but an email and others have some."
"00;52;07;00","00;52;07;19","I think"
"00;52;07;19","00;52;08;22","Murray Shanahan's"
"00;52;08;22","00;52;09;21","have some interesting models,"
"00;52;09;21","00;52;11;07","like the sense of time"
"00;52;11;07","00;52;11;23","in terms"
"00;52;11;23","00;52;12;14","of like"
"00;52;12;14","00;52;12;27","the amount"
"00;52;12;27","00;52;14;09","of like information"
"00;52;14;09","00;52;16;00","flux through your sensors."
"00;52;16;00","00;52;16;19","But then there's like"
"00;52;16;19","00;52;17;18","another kind of time"
"00;52;17;18","00;52;20;10","that might actually involve like"
"00;52;20;10","00;52;22;24","over specialization of a trajectory."
"00;52;23;09","00;52;24;18","And you might be using something"
"00;52;24;18","00;52;25;23","like path integration"
"00;52;25;23","00;52;26;28","in terms of like"
"00;52;26;28","00;52;29;19","how you're doing some types of duration"
"00;52;29;19","00;52;30;27","estimation,"
"00;52;30;29","00;52;31;29","not necessarily just like"
"00;52;31;29","00;52;32;27","accumulating like"
"00;52;33;29","00;52;34;16","like a sense of"
"00;52;34;16","00;52;35;16","accumulation, but"
"00;52;35;16","00;52;36;22","some of it might be like,"
"00;52;36;22","00;52;37;21","where am I"
"00;52;37;21","00;52;39;21","in navigating through a timeline?"
"00;52;39;21","00;52;41;03","And I think you'll see this reflected in"
"00;52;41;03","00;52;42;08","like the way people talk."
"00;52;42;08","00;52;43;16","And we could like dismiss this to say,"
"00;52;43;16","00;52;45;08","I guess that's just more metaphor."
"00;52;45;08","00;52;47;03","No, I think that"
"00;52;47;03","00;52;48;06","that metaphor is"
"00;52;48;06","00;52;49;14","how we're actually constructing"
"00;52;49;14","00;52;50;24","some sense of time,"
"00;52;50;24","00;52;52;29","which actually gives us like"
"00;52;52;29","00;52;53;27","forms of control"
"00;52;53;27","00;52;55;17","that we would not have otherwise,"
"00;52;55;17","00;52;56;10","where we not able"
"00;52;56;10","00;52;58;00","to actually extend our minds"
"00;52;58;00","00;52;59;18","metaphorically in that way."
"00;52;59;18","00;53;02;06","And then be able to basically navigate"
"00;53;02;06","00;53;02;24","through spatial"
"00;53;02;24","00;53;04;11","time to keep track of some longer"
"00;53;04;11","00;53;06;05","time sequences"
"00;53;06;05","00;53;09;00","if we want to plan with respect to them."
"00;53;09;00","00;53;09;16","Awesome."
"00;53;09;16","00;53;11;19","Thank you, Stephen."
"00;53;12;28","00;53;13;25","Hello."
"00;53;13;25","00;53;14;23","Great to see you."
"00;53;14;23","00;53;18;07","And I was curious in terms of time."
"00;53;18;07","00;53;19;26","Well, one of the things is"
"00;53;19;26","00;53;20;29","do you think time is"
"00;53;22;08","00;53;24;10","or this process is distributed"
"00;53;24;14","00;53;28;04","around different parts of the sensor and"
"00;53;28;25","00;53;30;21","processing because different sensor"
"00;53;30;21","00;53;31;25","them have different"
"00;53;31;25","00;53;33;13","speeds or different rates"
"00;53;33;13","00;53;35;17","or different abilities."
"00;53;35;17","00;53;36;07","And then the other thing"
"00;53;36;07","00;53;37;20","coming back to time as well is"
"00;53;37;20","00;53;40;15","people can be going through time"
"00;53;40;15","00;53;41;26","they can be like"
"00;53;41;26","00;53;43;23","or they can be time"
"00;53;43;23","00;53;46;24","can come towards them or a time can be"
"00;53;46;24","00;53;48;13","sort of developing around them,"
"00;53;48;13","00;53;50;06","which often happens in Asian cultures."
"00;53;50;06","00;53;50;29","It's a"
"00;53;50;29","00;53;52;25","time it's seen more as"
"00;53;52;25","00;53;54;12","something that's around them."
"00;53;54;12","00;53;55;01","So I'm curious,"
"00;53;55;01","00;53;56;16","like how these"
"00;53;56;16","00;53;58;24","these ideas of temporality"
"00;53;58;24","00;54;00;27","might might link to"
"00;54;00;27","00;54;03;09","the ways that we imagine ourselves."
"00;54;03;15","00;54;05;18","We are sensor"
"00;54;12;10","00;54;15;03","I mean, if it is indeed the case that"
"00;54;15;03","00;54;18;09","some forms of"
"00;54;18;09","00;54;20;19","the spatial association, if it's a case"
"00;54;20;19","00;54;21;27","of spatial rising time"
"00;54;23;05","00;54;25;13","that's happening both"
"00;54;26;11","00;54;28;02","in some cases through some"
"00;54;28;02","00;54;30;06","some fairly abstract"
"00;54;31;05","00;54;33;26","metaphorical linguistic constructions,"
"00;54;33;26","00;54;35;24","then this would"
"00;54;35;27","00;54;37;26","imply that you should be able to get"
"00;54;37;26","00;54;40;23","meaningful cultural differences"
"00;54;41;11","00;54;43;22","based on these shared constructions"
"00;54;43;22","00;54;45;10","and maybe even some quasi"
"00;54;45;10","00;54;46;15","like work in effects"
"00;54;46;15","00;54;48;14","where like linguistic modifications"
"00;54;48;14","00;54;49;29","could actually"
"00;54;50;05","00;54;50;22","change the way"
"00;54;50;22","00;54;53;00","people are seeing themselves and others"
"00;54;53;00","00;54;53;18","in relation"
"00;54;53;18","00;54;54;03","to time"
"00;54;54;03","00;54;54;23","with some fairly"
"00;54;54;23","00;54;56;14","significant consequences."
"00;54;56;14","00;54;57;08","So"
"00;54;59;16","00;55;00;20","when we're working on effects"
"00;55;00;20","00;55;01;10","to contact"
"00;55;01;10","00;55;03;12","the jargon of just like"
"00;55;03;12","00;55;05;20","the idea that the our thought"
"00;55;05;20","00;55;06;15","is constrained"
"00;55;06;15","00;55;09;18","in some meaningful way by the"
"00;55;09;18","00;55;10;23","constraints and affordances"
"00;55;10;23","00;55;11;20","of our language,"
"00;55;11;20","00;55;13;08","our constraints, influences"
"00;55;13;08","00;55;14;18","the way we think."
"00;55;15;25","00;55;16;28","There's like stronger and weaker"
"00;55;16;28","00;55;19;21","versions of that hypothesis."
"00;55;19;22","00;55;20;01","Thank you."
"00;55;20;01","00;55;20;25","Blue"
"00;55;23;17","00;55;24;22","So it's interesting"
"00;55;24;22","00;55;26;16","because as we've been talking about"
"00;55;26;16","00;55;29;10","like spatial maps and spatial contexts"
"00;55;29;10","00;55;31;08","like spatial representation,"
"00;55;31;08","00;55;33;14","navigating through space,"
"00;55;33;14","00;55;36;01","I have been thinking a lot about"
"00;55;36;16","00;55;39;06","semantic navigation also like"
"00;55;39;06","00;55;40;23","when we're looking through,"
"00;55;40;23","00;55;42;14","looking for a thought"
"00;55;42;14","00;55;43;17","when we're looking for"
"00;55;44;28","00;55;45;16","navigating"
"00;55;45;16","00;55;47;08","foraging for information or,"
"00;55;47;08","00;55;50;07","you know, in these context rich domains"
"00;55;50;07","00;55;52;21","and they just wonder what"
"00;55;53;17","00;55;56;24","like is the semantic navigation"
"00;55;57;15","00;55;59;28","related to linked to"
"00;55;59;28","00;56;01;10","like is there overlap"
"00;56;01;10","00;56;03;05","in the brain in the way that we process"
"00;56;03;05","00;56;04;27","semantic orientation"
"00;56;04;27","00;56;08;08","and representation and space also?"
"00;56;08;14","00;56;11;08","So I'm just curious"
"00;56;12;08","00;56;14;20","hashtag maps of meaning"
"00;56;21;17","00;56;23;19","maybe I can"
"00;56;23;19","00;56;25;06","I can respond to this"
"00;56;25;06","00;56;26;27","from from my perspective"
"00;56;26;27","00;56;28;14","and then I'll probably have to"
"00;56;28;14","00;56;29;22","leave you guys."
"00;56;30;02","00;56;30;28","But so"
"00;56;30;28","00;56;32;17","I think one of the most important things"
"00;56;32;17","00;56;36;07","of this to me of all of a whole this"
"00;56;36;11","00;56;37;17","this whole endeavor of"
"00;56;37;17","00;56;39;17","of constructing this"
"00;56;39;17","00;56;42;08","and doing it together with Adam, is that"
"00;56;42;08","00;56;44;21","we basically we start off with"
"00;56;46;00","00;56;48;21","this robot navigation, which is from"
"00;56;49;07","00;56;51;09","this perspective, this really like"
"00;56;51;29","00;56;52;25","about X"
"00;56;52;25","00;56;54;03","and Y position"
"00;56;54;03","00;56;56;05","and about times and seconds."
"00;56;56;26","00;56;58;12","But what we do here"
"00;56;58;12","00;57;01;12","is we by by creating this model,"
"00;57;01;20","00;57;05;13","we basically get rid of this loci"
"00;57;05;13","00;57;07;19","of being"
"00;57;07;19","00;57;10;05","ground within seconds and meters"
"00;57;10;12","00;57;11;06","basically."
"00;57;11;06","00;57;13;15","I think this is one of the most crucial"
"00;57;14;12","00;57;16;26","aspects of of our model"
"00;57;17;00","00;57;19;06","because it shows that well,"
"00;57;19;11","00;57;20;05","on the one hand,"
"00;57;20;05","00;57;21;03","I think we all agree"
"00;57;21;03","00;57;22;17","that we don't get bored"
"00;57;22;17","00;57;24;24","measuring diamond seconds and measuring"
"00;57;25;05","00;57;26;29","space and meters. So"
"00;57;28;03","00;57;28;22","we actually"
"00;57;28;22","00;57;29;16","get at least the"
"00;57;29;16","00;57;32;13","framework that also gets rid of these"
"00;57;32;16","00;57;35;19","these metrics and just"
"00;57;37;10","00;57;39;00","learn to navigate"
"00;57;39;00","00;57;41;00","in this more abstract space."
"00;57;42;01","00;57;44;14","And if we can get it to work for"
"00;57;44;26","00;57;46;20","navigation"
"00;57;47;02","00;57;48;03","for, say,"
"00;57;48;03","00;57;50;05","moving through actual physical space,"
"00;57;50;26","00;57;52;26","then I'm pretty sure that we can also"
"00;57;53;05","00;57;55;23","extend the model further to navigate"
"00;57;56;14","00;57;58;23","any space because in the end,"
"00;57;58;23","00;58;02;00","this once we are at the"
"00;58;02;00","00;58;02;08","lowest,"
"00;58;02;08","00;58;03;11","we get the level"
"00;58;03;11","00;58;05;21","above our sensory inputs,"
"00;58;06;02","00;58;07;24","then everything is in our case,"
"00;58;07;24","00;58;11;04","just learn these things basically."
"00;58;11;18","00;58;12;19","So if we can,"
"00;58;12;19","00;58;14;08","if we can make this work"
"00;58;14;08","00;58;16;12","for physical navigation,"
"00;58;16;12","00;58;19;23","I think we're all already a big step"
"00;58;19;23","00;58;20;29","closer to,"
"00;58;20;29","00;58;22;11","to making it work"
"00;58;22;11","00;58;23;23","for, for any navigation."
"00;58;23;23","00;58;24;08","And indeed,"
"00;58;24;08","00;58;26;04","we come to the realm of like you said,"
"00;58;27;06","00;58;29;16","I have lots of memories"
"00;58;29;16","00;58;31;06","these are tied together"
"00;58;31;06","00;58;31;25","somehow"
"00;58;31;25","00;58;32;26","because how,"
"00;58;32;26","00;58;34;28","how these memories just came to be,"
"00;58;35;16","00;58;36;13","can I now"
"00;58;36;13","00;58;38;07","navigate this space towards"
"00;58;38;07","00;58;40;03","the memory that I'm looking for?"
"00;58;40;03","00;58;44;13","Or if you are solving a math problem,"
"00;58;44;20","00;58;45;20","how do you navigate"
"00;58;45;20","00;58;47;22","the space of medications through"
"00;58;47;23","00;58;49;17","get the solution for this thing?"
"00;58;49;17","00;58;50;24","I think"
"00;58;51;06","00;58;53;04","once you get rid of"
"00;58;54;06","00;58;58;20","that, the time and space that"
"00;58;58;23","00;58;59;07","that's"
"00;58;59;07","00;59;02;04","so tight for your your sensorium and"
"00;59;03;00","00;59;03;22","move towards"
"00;59;03;22","00;59;05;12","the more abstract space"
"00;59;05;12","00;59;07;25","and be able to navigate that"
"00;59;07;25","00;59;08;12","this is"
"00;59;08;12","00;59;09;19","this is the crucial"
"00;59;09;19","00;59;12;07","the crucial bit here, I would say."
"00;59;12;07","00;59;12;20","So with that."
"00;59;12;20","00;59;14;09","So I'd like to thank you"
"00;59;14;09","00;59;15;19","for for the discussion."
"00;59;15;19","00;59;17;26","So now I'll try to be there next week."
"00;59;17;26","00;59;20;13","As well and"
"00;59;20;13","00;59;22;18","I enjoyed the discussion further."
"00;59;22;18","00;59;23;05","Thank you, Tim."
"00;59;24;23","00;59;25;07","You"
"00;59;26;06","00;59;27;26","cool. Very interesting."
"00;59;27;26","00;59;30;00","And also speaking to that"
"00;59;30;27","00;59;33;00","cultural basis,"
"00;59;33;00","00;59;37;00","there was the inch foot pound paradigm"
"00;59;37;23","00;59;40;10","and that has in certain places"
"00;59;40;10","00;59;44;00","also coexisted or been complementary"
"00;59;44;00","00;59;45;00","or contradictory"
"00;59;45;00","00;59;47;10","with the centimeters, grams"
"00;59;47;19","00;59;48;23","second is based upon"
"00;59;48;23","00;59;49;17","something different"
"00;59;49;17","00;59;50;29","and what would happen"
"00;59;50;29","00;59;53;02","if a larva was born."
"00;59;53;02","00;59;54;08","And the little one,"
"00;59;54;08","00;59;55;10","the second was like"
"00;59;55;10","00;59;57;03","what we call 3 seconds"
"00;59;57;03","00;59;59;05","is that just a more chill larva?"
"00;59;59;17","01;00;02;04","Because every one of its moments"
"01;00;02;04","01;00;03;21","is taking a few more heartbeats."
"01;00;03;21","01;00;05;06","It can actually take a breath per"
"01;00;05;06","01;00;06;04","little one."
"01;00;06;04","01;00;08;13","So there's a lot that we probably don't"
"01;00;08;20","01;00;10;17","even know, how much we don't know."
"01;00;10;17","01;00;12;01","And so we're in feedback"
"01;00;12;01","01;00;13;21","with these models"
"01;00;13;21","01;00;16;12","that both fully realized"
"01;00;16;12","01;00;18;14","not just in the equations,"
"01;00;18;14","01;00;20;17","but in the actual robotics"
"01;00;21;04","01;00;21;25","grounding us"
"01;00;21;25","01;00;23;20","in those actual observations"
"01;00;23;20","01;00;26;15","of red, green, blue pixel intensities."
"01;00;26;26","01;00;27;10","Which is like"
"01;00;27;10","01;00;28;01","when Adam was saying"
"01;00;28;01","01;00;30;13","that robotics are an empirical platform"
"01;00;30;13","01;00;31;14","to be studying"
"01;00;31;14","01;00;33;04","the nature of cognition"
"01;00;33;04","01;00;34;12","and brain in mind."
"01;00;34;12","01;00;37;16","And then here is where we move into"
"01;00;37;28","01;00;39;25","a different space in time."
"01;00;39;25","01;00;41;14","And so that is"
"01;00;41;14","01;00;44;00","an excellent point by Tim."
"01;00;44;00","01;00;44;11","Stephen"
"01;00;47;10","01;00;47;21","Yeah."
"01;00;47;21","01;00;48;21","So following on from"
"01;00;48;21","01;00;51;01","what you're saying, Daniel, as"
"01;00;51;03","01;00;53;04","we know, Tim just mentioned about,"
"01;00;53;04","01;00;55;21","you know, have the abstracted ideas"
"01;00;56;24","01;00;59;02","but there's also maybe the grounded"
"01;00;59;02","01;01;01;20","you mentioned grounded ways of knowing."
"01;01;01;27","01;01;04;08","So it might be that the future"
"01;01;04;08","01;01;06;21","we abstract out what we think"
"01;01;06;21","01;01;07;16","it might be"
"01;01;07;16","01;01;09;23","and then there may be ways where we feel"
"01;01;10;04","01;01;12;05","what's riots, what feels."
"01;01;12;16","01;01;15;17","So you hit a door and you feel there's"
"01;01;15;17","01;01;17;28","an information affordance"
"01;01;17;28","01;01;19;21","and it could be grounds."
"01;01;19;21","01;01;22;11","So I was wondering how much that can"
"01;01;24;01","01;01;26;10","that supports not needing to have"
"01;01;27;02","01;01;28;16","the metrics, like you say,"
"01;01;28;16","01;01;29;16","and maybe the metrics"
"01;01;29;16","01;01;30;16","that we've created"
"01;01;30;16","01;01;32;18","like the second apart"
"01;01;32;18","01;01;33;04","because they're"
"01;01;33;04","01;01;34;22","at that kind of sweet spot."
"01;01;34;22","01;01;35;15","OK, somehow"
"01;01;35;15","01;01;37;10","close to a sweet, sweet spot"
"01;01;37;10","01;01;39;08","of what sort of makes sense."
"01;01;39;08","01;01;39;18","You know,"
"01;01;39;18","01;01;40;19","someone had to decide on a"
"01;01;40;19","01;01;42;11","foot or a hand, you know, so"
"01;01;43;10","01;01;44;24","was it the small person's hand"
"01;01;44;24","01;01;45;27","was the big person's hand?"
"01;01;45;27","01;01;47;06","And they sort of said, well,"
"01;01;47;06","01;01;48;24","what about John?"
"01;01;48;24","01;01;50;29","I maybe was the king, I don't know."
"01;01;50;29","01;01;53;00","But it got decided somehow."
"01;01;53;01","01;01;54;09","So I think this is a"
"01;01;54;09","01;01;55;19","a good question about ground"
"01;01;55;19","01;01;56;23","universe is an abstraction."
"01;01;56;23","01;01;58;13","I don't know what the"
"01;01;58;13","01;02;00;22","what the thoughts are on that."
"01;02;00;22","01;02;01;22","Yes."
"01;02;02;16","01;02;03;22","This higher level"
"01;02;03;22","01;02;05;25","in a purely metric model,"
"01;02;06;08","01;02;07;04","it could be like, well,"
"01;02;07;04","01;02;07;21","on the bottom"
"01;02;07;21","01;02;10;02","level, we're dealing with centimeters"
"01;02;10;13","01;02;13;08","and 100 milliseconds frames."
"01;02;13;17","01;02;14;06","And the core"
"01;02;14;06","01;02;17;07","screening is at the level of 100 times"
"01;02;17;07","01;02;18;29","the spatial distance and 100 times"
"01;02;18;29","01;02;21;02","the temporal distance."
"01;02;21;17","01;02;23;02","What this model is doing"
"01;02;23;02","01;02;24;07","is something different"
"01;02;24;07","01;02;25;20","and I think that is, again,"
"01;02;25;20","01;02;27;25","this biological inspiration,"
"01;02;27;25","01;02;29;00","which is that"
"01;02;29;06","01;02;30;07","what is happening"
"01;02;30;07","01;02;31;06","in the level"
"01;02;31;06","01;02;32;10","that the action perception"
"01;02;32;10","01;02;34;19","loop is nested within"
"01;02;35;12","01;02;38;15","is not just of a bigger version."
"01;02;39;21","01;02;41;06","Well, it both is in essence"
"01;02;41;06","01;02;43;09","because it has some resonance"
"01;02;43;09","01;02;45;03","graphical structures"
"01;02;45;03","01;02;47;08","that support the compose ability"
"01;02;47;08","01;02;48;04","and the tracked ability"
"01;02;48;04","01;02;49;23","of active models."
"01;02;49;23","01;02;51;01","Yet also it's doing something"
"01;02;51;01","01;02;52;21","that's categorically difference,"
"01;02;52;21","01;02;53;02","which is"
"01;02;53;02","01;02;57;00","navigating in a more topological space"
"01;02;57;05","01;02;59;11","rather than the more geometric space"
"01;02;59;11","01;03;00;13","down the bottom."
"01;03;00;13","01;03;03;18","What do you I'm thinking about"
"01;03;07;05","01;03;07;22","it seems like"
"01;03;07;22","01;03;10;18","with the well, I guess one is I suspect"
"01;03;11;04","01;03;14;05","it is near no coincidence that seconds"
"01;03;15;02","01;03;16;21","are about the time extended"
"01;03;16;21","01;03;17;21","that they are"
"01;03;17;28","01;03;19;04","and that we have like"
"01;03;19;04","01;03;21;27","the metric units we use like a foot"
"01;03;22;08","01;03;25;24","or a meter or a yard in terms of like"
"01;03;26;26","01;03;27;07","in terms"
"01;03;27;07","01;03;28;22","of grounding and in terms of connection"
"01;03;28;22","01;03;30;02","to affordance."
"01;03;30;02","01;03;32;08","So like a second for maybe, you know,"
"01;03;32;29","01;03;35;15","a relation to signal maybe like"
"01;03;36;10","01;03;37;11","heart rates"
"01;03;37;11","01;03;38;11","or certain"
"01;03;38;11","01;03;39;29","biophysical pattern generators"
"01;03;39;29","01;03;41;22","or like the scope of working memory"
"01;03;41;22","01;03;43;20","being an iconic memory"
"01;03;43;20","01;03;46;01","being stable on different scales"
"01;03;46;21","01;03;47;28","or like a yard"
"01;03;47;28","01;03;49;09","or a meter like the basically"
"01;03;49;09","01;03;51;07","the reach of your arm"
"01;03;51;07","01;03;53;03","like Harry personal space and like"
"01;03;54;20","01;03;55;26","a field of affordances"
"01;03;55;26","01;03;56;16","around your body"
"01;03;56;16","01;03;59;17","was particularly concentrated"
"01;04;00;10","01;04;01;10","and so,"
"01;04;01;12","01;04;01;18","you know,"
"01;04;01;18","01;04;02;03","these are ways"
"01;04;02;03","01;04;02;23","in which like for instance,"
"01;04;02;23","01;04;06;00","like the granularity of our modeling"
"01;04;06;00","01;04;07;22","would be influenced by language"
"01;04;07;22","01;04;09;16","or their language would reflect it"
"01;04;09;16","01;04;10;22","and maybe"
"01;04;10;26","01;04;12;01","to different extents influence it."
"01;04;12;01","01;04;13;27","But you would have like this"
"01;04;13;27","01;04;16;18","other kind of granularity of space"
"01;04;16;18","01;04;17;07","that might be different"
"01;04;17;07","01;04;18;08","for different species,"
"01;04;18;08","01;04;19;13","but also within a species"
"01;04;19;13","01;04;20;26","and with an individual"
"01;04;20;26","01;04;21;12","like for instance,"
"01;04;21;12","01;04;23;29","like these like tilings of"
"01;04;25;10","01;04;27;10","like hippocampal system,"
"01;04;27;10","01;04;29;25","like layout, things like titans of space"
"01;04;30;27","01;04;32;15","for each house domain."
"01;04;32;15","01;04;34;23","And they'll have like a kind of the"
"01;04;34;23","01;04;35;20","they'll be refreshed"
"01;04;35;20","01;04;36;16","like maybe it looks like"
"01;04;36;16","01;04;38;21","like every 3 seconds or so,"
"01;04;38;21","01;04;41;21","but if you're in like a big space,"
"01;04;41;21","01;04;44;06","but this tiling will actually attack"
"01;04;44;07","01;04;46;16","of hexagonal arrays"
"01;04;47;02","01;04;48;21","and just like hexagonal time,"
"01;04;48;21","01;04;49;11","it will fill"
"01;04;49;11","01;04;50;01","whatever space"
"01;04;50;01","01;04;50;23","and then it'll"
"01;04;50;23","01;04;52;27","have different levels of granularity."
"01;04;52;27","01;04;54;01","And so if you're in like"
"01;04;54;01","01;04;54;28","a big space, it's"
"01;04;54;28","01;04;57;04","going to necessarily be less granular."
"01;04;57;04","01;04;59;13","And if you're in a small space, it'll be"
"01;05;00;08","01;05;01;11","probably be more green."
"01;05;01;11","01;05;02;08","But there's other things"
"01;05;02;08","01;05;03;12","that influence the granularity."
"01;05;03;12","01;05;04;02","Also like"
"01;05;05;21","01;05;06;15","there's like brainstem"
"01;05;06;15","01;05;08;19","locomotor nuclei, they're like detecting"
"01;05;08;19","01;05;10;21","how fast are you moving?"
"01;05;10;21","01;05;11;20","And then this will influence"
"01;05;11;20","01;05;15;09","the granularity of like kind of space."
"01;05;15;29","01;05;16;28","And so"
"01;05;17;22","01;05;18;14","that's"
"01;05;19;03","01;05;20;12","like some of it"
"01;05;21;26","01;05;22;18","you know,"
"01;05;23;16","01;05;26;02","some of this what is relevant"
"01;05;26;14","01;05;28;16","now, some of this is"
"01;05;29;15","01;05;30;26","a greening of a domain,"
"01;05;30;26","01;05;31;27","some of it will be affected"
"01;05;31;27","01;05;33;02","by like these"
"01;05;35;09","01;05;37;26","basically innate, like"
"01;05;37;26","01;05;40;00","architectural inductive biases."
"01;05;40;00","01;05;40;27","And some of them will be more"
"01;05;40;27","01;05;44;02","like sociocultural or constructed"
"01;05;45;17","01;05;46;02","ones."
"01;05;46;02","01;05;46;27","And just"
"01;05;47;03","01;05;49;23","moving on as opposed to say like how?"
"01;05;49;23","01;05;53;12","Tim Russert does one hell of a mike drop"
"01;05;53;25","01;05;54;19","because, you know,"
"01;05;54;19","01;05;56;20","what you're saying is like basically."
"01;05;57;00","01;05;57;16","Yeah."
"01;05;57;16","01;05;58;08","So he's already"
"01;05;58;08","01;05;59;07","solved like"
"01;05;59;07","01;06;01;08","in terms of kinds of grounding."
"01;06;01;08","01;06;03;18","Like not only is this like potentially"
"01;06;03;22","01;06;04;24","a way of having"
"01;06;06;02","01;06;06;27","an architecture"
"01;06;06;27","01;06;07;15","capable of"
"01;06;07;15","01;06;09;22","navigating conceptual domains"
"01;06;09;22","01;06;11;02","and abstractions,"
"01;06;11;02","01;06;12;03","basically with NGO"
"01;06;12;03","01;06;13;02","like system two way,"
"01;06;13;02","01;06;14;15","I or what"
"01;06;14;15","01;06;17;10","some would call like strong A.I.,"
"01;06;17;22","01;06;19;20","but it's also grounding in that"
"01;06;19;20","01;06;21;14","it actually works as a control system"
"01;06;21;14","01;06;23;11","for an embodied embedded agent"
"01;06;23;11","01;06;24;14","and so now you might have"
"01;06;24;14","01;06;26;21","a single system capable"
"01;06;26;21","01;06;29;09","of both giving you simple grounding by"
"01;06;30;03","01;06;30;27","allowing something"
"01;06;30;27","01;06;31;24","to be in the world"
"01;06;31;24","01;06;33;23","alongside other agents."
"01;06;33;23","01;06;36;12","And have actual actual semantics"
"01;06;37;17","01;06;38;09","in terms of pointing"
"01;06;38;09","01;06;39;11","to things in the world,"
"01;06;39;11","01;06;40;05","like taking a kind of like"
"01;06;40;05","01;06;42;06","a semantic network"
"01;06;42;15","01;06;43;07","of just like symbols"
"01;06;43;07","01;06;44;14","pointing at symbols."
"01;06;44;14","01;06;45;01","But ultimately"
"01;06;45;01","01;06;47;14","these such a system would allow you"
"01;06;47;14","01;06;49;27","to ground out your semantic network"
"01;06;49;27","01;06;51;00","and things in the world"
"01;06;51;00","01;06;53;01","and shared symbols"
"01;06;53;10","01;06;55;03","and so, I mean, ultimately,"
"01;06;55;03","01;06;56;09","this is a path to,"
"01;06;56;09","01;06;58;09","you know, who knows how far,"
"01;06;58;09","01;06;58;20","you know,"
"01;06;58;20","01;07;00;07","anyone working on it today gets,"
"01;07;00;07","01;07;02;16","but this is ultimately a path to A.I."
"01;07;03;05","01;07;03;28","built"
"01;07;04;03","01;07;06;18","that takes on an activist principles of"
"01;07;06;25","01;07;08;07","what you would need to do. So"
"01;07;09;09","01;07;11;00","which is more than a little exciting"
"01;07;11;00","01;07;11;22","to think"
"01;07;12;07","01;07;12;15","oh, I'm"
"01;07;12;15","01;07;13;16","starting to see why"
"01;07;13;16","01;07;16;21","people are interested in this"
"01;07;16;26","01;07;18;28","excellent point about the symbolic"
"01;07;19;09","01;07;20;26","semantics and logic"
"01;07;20;26","01;07;21;24","and how that connects"
"01;07;21;24","01;07;23;02","to the inactive insight,"
"01;07;23;02","01;07;24;27","the pragmatic turn,"
"01;07;24;27","01;07;27;22","ecological psychology, biosimilars"
"01;07;27;24","01;07;29;29","is like all of these features"
"01;07;29;29","01;07;32;28","that get left on the cutting block."
"01;07;33;07","01;07;36;03","If we take a computational linguistics"
"01;07;36;03","01;07;37;27","approach only"
"01;07;37;27","01;07;40;04","and computational linguistics"
"01;07;40;04","01;07;42;07","plus the mouth movements"
"01;07;42;07","01;07;44;21","already, one has incorporated"
"01;07;45;05","01;07;46;12","that pragmatic turn"
"01;07;46;12","01;07;47;25","in that embodiment element."
"01;07;47;25","01;07;49;20","And that's quite a different model"
"01;07;49;20","01;07;50;22","than just the substrate"
"01;07;50;22","01;07;53;22","independence symbol manipulator."
"01;07;54;02","01;07;54;26","Stephen."
"01;07;55;13","01;07;55;25","Right."
"01;07;55;28","01;07;57;13","Yeah, I think it's exciting indeed,"
"01;07;57;13","01;07;58;28","because it can open up"
"01;07;58;28","01;07;59;15","a lot of"
"01;07;59;15","01;08;00;11","I'm very interested"
"01;08;00;11","01;08;01;28","in mental space psychology"
"01;08;01;28","01;08;03;08","and very personal space"
"01;08;03;08","01;08;06;03","and working with space as an instrument"
"01;08;06;07","01;08;07;10","and well,"
"01;08;07;10","01;08;08;14","I'm more than interested in it."
"01;08;08;14","01;08;11;24","That's my main focus in many ways."
"01;08;11;24","01;08;12;04","And"
"01;08;13;02","01;08;13;16","but what's"
"01;08;13;16","01;08;16;19","really been the challenge is"
"01;08;16;21","01;08;19;07","giving it a plausible bridge right back"
"01;08;19;26","01;08;21;01","because they're working"
"01;08;21;01","01;08;21;26","primarily on"
"01;08;21;26","01;08;25;01","looking at what action policies are"
"01;08;25;01","01;08;27;20","and what has been enacted."
"01;08;27;20","01;08;28;23","And it's very hard"
"01;08;28;23","01;08;30;26","to go back to observations"
"01;08;30;26","01;08;31;23","because you're coming"
"01;08;31;23","01;08;32;21","from the other direction."
"01;08;32;21","01;08;34;25","So I think it'd be very interesting"
"01;08;34;25","01;08;36;11","to see what this robot,"
"01;08;36;11","01;08;37;18","whether you could actually see."
"01;08;37;18","01;08;40;05","Well, what kind of robot is this robot?"
"01;08;41;01","01;08;41;26","What's it like?"
"01;08;41;26","01;08;43;03","What kind of"
"01;08;43;03","01;08;44;22","story patterning"
"01;08;44;22","01;08;47;00","gets triggered by this robot?"
"01;08;47;00","01;08;48;22","And maybe if I"
"01;08;49;01","01;08;52;00","grew up with a slightly heavier wheel"
"01;08;52;01","01;08;53;17","on one side or something,"
"01;08;53;17","01;08;57;05","it has a slightly different"
"01;08;57;11","01;08;59;06","character, you know?"
"01;08;59;06","01;08;59;20","So I mean,"
"01;08;59;20","01;09;01;27","I wonder if there's a kind of an actual"
"01;09;01;27","01;09;03;19","a way that the action"
"01;09;03;19","01;09;06;09","policies themselves start to encode"
"01;09;06;20","01;09;08;17","a server personality"
"01;09;08;17","01;09;13;02","based on the physicality and sensor"
"01;09;13;18","01;09;14;17","that get weighted"
"01;09;18;04","01;09;19;23","I mean, that would be like"
"01;09;19;23","01;09;22;26","in terms of this generalization of slam"
"01;09;22;26","01;09;24;04","principles"
"01;09;24;04","01;09;25;23","as a way of understanding cognition"
"01;09;25;23","01;09;26;12","more generally."
"01;09;26;12","01;09;26;27","I think that would be"
"01;09;26;27","01;09;28;11","like a great test case"
"01;09;28;11","01;09;29;05","and that"
"01;09;29;11","01;09;30;20","those are the kinds of hypotheses"
"01;09;30;20","01;09;32;01","you would look for."
"01;09;33;01","01;09;33;17","I think like"
"01;09;33;20","01;09;35;09","if you're real is like weighted"
"01;09;35;09","01;09;37;20","more heavily on one side or the other"
"01;09;37;20","01;09;38;19","that can have all sorts of things"
"01;09;38;19","01;09;41;13","like for instance, like, like what"
"01;09;42;06","01;09;42;29","Tim was describing"
"01;09;42;29","01;09;44;18","like this know creation"
"01;09;44;18","01;09;45;03","where it's"
"01;09;45;03","01;09;47;17","not just a function of like a metrics,"
"01;09;47;26","01;09;48;24","but on"
"01;09;49;13","01;09;52;19","information and the"
"01;09;53;24","01;09;55;13","and so this creates like"
"01;09;55;13","01;09;56;23","a distorted space, but,"
"01;09;56;23","01;09;58;10","but an adaptively distorted space."
"01;09;58;10","01;09;59;23","You would expect usually"
"01;09;59;23","01;10;01;19","because multiple forms of value"
"01;10;01;19","01;10;04;05","are influencing the granularity of this"
"01;10;04;28","01;10;05;18","sort of space."
"01;10;05;18","01;10;07;08","Like that's always like a map."
"01;10;07;08","01;10;09;01","It's like space is a graph,"
"01;10;09;01","01;10;10;14","but a graph"
"01;10;10;14","01;10;12;25","being shaped by multiple kinds of value"
"01;10;12;25","01;10;14;13","and so you would expect things like that"
"01;10;14;13","01;10;15;11","kind of real asymmetry"
"01;10;15;11","01;10;17;03","you're talking about to result"
"01;10;17;03","01;10;19;22","in different kinds of graph spaces."
"01;10;20;00","01;10;21;18","And this could then"
"01;10;21;18","01;10;23;29","potentially have some transfer"
"01;10;23;29","01;10;25;19","more generally across"
"01;10;25;19","01;10;26;15","more than just physical"
"01;10;26;15","01;10;27;13","spaces in theory."
"01;10;28;24","01;10;29;24","Also,"
"01;10;30;01","01;10;30;11","you know,"
"01;10;30;11","01;10;31;02","coming back to like that"
"01;10;31;02","01;10;33;25","granularity issue like let's say like"
"01;10;34;13","01;10;35;03","the way you move through"
"01;10;35;03","01;10;37;07","the world is quicker or slower."
"01;10;37;07","01;10;39;10","That itself then might have transferred"
"01;10;39;10","01;10;40;18","not just to, well,"
"01;10;40;18","01;10;41;01","how is it"
"01;10;41;01","01;10;41;28","that I'm representing the space"
"01;10;41;28","01;10;43;16","I'm physically moving through,"
"01;10;43;16","01;10;45;02","but that then could get reflected"
"01;10;45;02","01;10;46;12","in cognitive styles"
"01;10;46;12","01;10;47;09","in terms of like the way"
"01;10;47;09","01;10;50;06","you relate to like semantic spaces"
"01;10;50;15","01;10;51;20","in terms of the way"
"01;10;51;20","01;10;54;00","you're going to forge through them,"
"01;10;54;00","01;10;56;07","what you consider to be near"
"01;10;56;07","01;10;57;22","or far connections."
"01;10;57;22","01;11;00;19","So like this is the kind of like"
"01;11;00;19","01;11;01;05","that would be like"
"01;11;01;05","01;11;03;23","a whole research program, which would be"
"01;11;04;26","01;11;05;24","but using this as like"
"01;11;05;24","01;11;06;16","a source of bridging"
"01;11;06;16","01;11;07;21","principles of like so"
"01;11;07;21","01;11;08;11","some connection"
"01;11;08;11","01;11;10;07","between embodied experience"
"01;11;10;07","01;11;12;09","and then more abstract thinking."
"01;11;12;09","01;11;12;25","Well,"
"01;11;12;25","01;11;13;19","maybe this is"
"01;11;13;19","01;11;14;03","a source"
"01;11;14;03","01;11;14;29","of some of the ways"
"01;11;14;29","01;11;16;02","in which concrete and body"
"01;11;16;02","01;11;18;11","experiences go on to shape"
"01;11;22;05","01;11;23;16","been basically"
"01;11;23;16","01;11;23;29","thought in the"
"01;11;23;29","01;11;26;29","more abstract level as well."
"01;11;30;03","01;11;33;02","Very, very interesting."
"01;11;33;02","01;11;34;22","And especially when we think"
"01;11;34;22","01;11;36;29","about the mental action papers"
"01;11;36;29","01;11;37;16","that we've read"
"01;11;37;16","01;11;39;11","like Livestream number 25"
"01;11;39;11","01;11;40;00","with Sanford"
"01;11;40;00","01;11;41;29","Smith at all about metacognition"
"01;11;41;29","01;11;43;20","as mental action."
"01;11;43;20","01;11;47;07","And so in this two level robotics case,"
"01;11;48;04","01;11;50;09","we're talking about the sort of"
"01;11;50;09","01;11;51;28","lower level motion"
"01;11;51;28","01;11;53;06","and then the higher level"
"01;11;53;06","01;11;54;24","navigation of locations"
"01;11;54;24","01;11;55;11","where we can say,"
"01;11;55;11","01;11;56;24","I want to go to the post office"
"01;11;56;24","01;11;58;06","and then the grocery store,"
"01;11;58;06","01;12;00;09","but then we have this more tactical"
"01;12;00;10","01;12;01;25","taking a step"
"01;12;01;25","01;12;04;00","timescale that's a lot faster"
"01;12;04;00","01;12;06;27","if this bottom layer is"
"01;12;06;27","01;12;09;09","based upon cognition and perception."
"01;12;09;18","01;12;10;08","Also,"
"01;12;10;08","01;12;11;06","this higher level"
"01;12;11;06","01;12;14;22","is not just navigation in the warehouse."
"01;12;15;02","01;12;16;04","That's actually like"
"01;12;16;04","01;12;16;23","where do"
"01;12;16;23","01;12;19;19","I wants to be in my regime of attention,"
"01;12;20;00","01;12;21;00","or what would I like"
"01;12;21;00","01;12;21;25","to be considering"
"01;12;21;25","01;12;23;15","from a metacognitive perspective?"
"01;12;23;15","01;12;25;00","How do I navigate"
"01;12;25;00","01;12;26;18","to a place where I prefer"
"01;12;26;18","01;12;28;12","was healthy for me?"
"01;12;28;12","01;12;29;24","So there's all kinds of other questions"
"01;12;29;24","01;12;31;26","about navigation in parameter spaces"
"01;12;32;03","01;12;32;29","that are not"
"01;12;32;29","01;12;34;25","just like top of logically,"
"01;12;34;25","01;12;36;29","the cousin of the warehouse space,"
"01;12;37;06","01;12;40;18","but truly in the mental space, fully"
"01;12;41;06","01;12;42;05","blue. And then Steve"
"01;12;44;22","01;12;46;27","so since we brought up Hierarchical"
"01;12;48;10","01;12;50;17","here in the paper, it looks like,"
"01;12;50;23","01;12;52;04","I mean, I can hold this for ten,"
"01;12;52;04","01;12;52;24","Adam two"
"01;12;52;24","01;12;53;17","if you don't feel"
"01;12;53;17","01;12;54;22","comfortable talking about it,"
"01;12;54;22","01;12;55;05","but maybe,"
"01;12;55;05","01;12;57;03","maybe you're good"
"01;12;57;04","01;12;59;13","in the hierarchical space."
"01;12;59;13","01;13;01;00","It seems that it's just a course"
"01;13;01;00","01;13;03;25","screening like in this paper, right?"
"01;13;03;25","01;13;05;02","So like, you know, the,"
"01;13;05;02","01;13;07;06","the higher level is just"
"01;13;07;11","01;13;07;24","like a core"
"01;13;07;24","01;13;08;12","screen version"
"01;13;08;12","01;13;10;20","of what happens at the lower level."
"01;13;11;03","01;13;12;27","And it's easy"
"01;13;12;27","01;13;14;26","to see how that takes place or takes"
"01;13;14;26","01;13;17;23","shape in like a topographical way"
"01;13;18;23","01;13;20;13","that it doesn't leave"
"01;13;20;13","01;13;22;13","a lot of room for emergence"
"01;13;22;13","01;13;23;10","and I wonder, like"
"01;13;23;10","01;13;24;07","if we jump"
"01;13;24;07","01;13;26;10","to thinking about a semantic space,"
"01;13;27;07","01;13;27;15","you know,"
"01;13;27;15","01;13;28;03","we have words"
"01;13;28;03","01;13;29;05","and that the relationships"
"01;13;29;05","01;13;31;08","with words to each other, proximity,"
"01;13;31;08","01;13;31;16","you know,"
"01;13;31;16","01;13;32;00","how close"
"01;13;32;00","01;13;33;08","do you expect to find,"
"01;13;33;08","01;13;35;18","you know, there to was or whatever."
"01;13;35;25","01;13;38;05","So how how linked are the words together"
"01;13;38;05","01;13;39;13","in a semantic space?"
"01;13;39;13","01;13;40;20","But I wonder"
"01;13;40;20","01;13;43;14","if you can go into topic modeling"
"01;13;43;23","01;13;45;04","and that gives you like a kind"
"01;13;45;04","01;13;46;05","of a queer screaming."
"01;13;47;10","01;13;48;02","But like is"
"01;13;48;02","01;13;49;14","there more room for emergence"
"01;13;49;14","01;13;51;08","in that kind of space?"
"01;13;51;08","01;13;52;05","Maybe"
"01;13;52;25","01;13;54;09","or like what other like"
"01;13;54;09","01;13;55;20","how do you I don't know."
"01;13;55;20","01;13;56;24","How would you"
"01;13;57;05","01;13;59;09","just allow for emergent things"
"01;13;59;16","01;14;00;27","to come through in"
"01;14;00;27","01;14;02;07","this kind of hierarchical"
"01;14;02;07","01;14;04;05","modeling or mapping"
"01;14;06;17","01;14;08;18","I think when"
"01;14;08;29","01;14;10;20","Sam comes back,"
"01;14;10;20","01;14;11;14","it could be worth it"
"01;14;11;14","01;14;13;29","for him to go into more detail on the"
"01;14;14;26","01;14;18;04","parameters that go into"
"01;14;18;16","01;14;21;02","node creation or not,"
"01;14;21;02","01;14;22;08","because I feel like"
"01;14;22;09","01;14;24;21","to the extent that you're getting"
"01;14;24;28","01;14;26;02","some flexibility"
"01;14;26;02","01;14;28;16","in ways of understanding like emergence"
"01;14;28;16","01;14;29;18","that would be your"
"01;14;29;18","01;14;30;28","your models of emergence"
"01;14;30;28","01;14;31;14","and where you are,"
"01;14;31;14","01;14;33;06","that that would be like where"
"01;14;33;06","01;14;35;16","you would basically create"
"01;14;35;16","01;14;36;00","this course"
"01;14;36;00","01;14;36;23","grained ontology"
"01;14;36;23","01;14;39;14","of different levels of granularity what"
"01;14;41;13","01;14;43;14","what constitutes like an occasion for"
"01;14;43;15","01;14;45;04","course screening of all kinds"
"01;14;47;24","01;14;49;10","it seems like"
"01;14;49;10","01;14;51;21","the node creation would be where"
"01;14;52;01","01;14;54;26","your assumptions about that"
"01;14;54;26","01;14;56;05","of what kinds of emergency"
"01;14;56;05","01;14;58;06","might be dealing with."
"01;14;58;18","01;14;59;00","That's where"
"01;14;59;00","01;15;01;09","would come into this kind of model."
"01;15;01;09","01;15;03;02","Is it rich enough"
"01;15;03;02","01;15;04;09","to account for all of them?"
"01;15;04;09","01;15;07;04","I wouldn't quite say that"
"01;15;07;04","01;15;07;23","in terms of like, you know,"
"01;15;07;23","01;15;08;24","all the different forms of emergence"
"01;15;08;24","01;15;09;23","you can get."
"01;15;10;09","01;15;11;25","So some of it, you know,"
"01;15;13;05","01;15;14;07","but that is fair."
"01;15;14;07","01;15;14;18","But"
"01;15;15;16","01;15;16;13","by enough, I mean,"
"01;15;16;13","01;15;18;11","you know, enough to be"
"01;15;18;11","01;15;20;03","a full on general intelligence."
"01;15;20;03","01;15;20;23","But"
"01;15;23;08","01;15;24;26","but but I do think there is room"
"01;15;24;26","01;15;25;21","for some"
"01;15;25;23","01;15;26;23","some flexibility"
"01;15;26;23","01;15;28;25","there at that parameter ization"
"01;15;29;10","01;15;31;03","of of terms model."
"01;15;31;03","01;15;31;16","But"
"01;15;32;16","01;15;34;23","he would explain it better than I would"
"01;15;36;18","01;15;37;05","make a comment"
"01;15;37;05","01;15;38;14","and then ask a question in the chat"
"01;15;38;14","01;15;39;25","and then also see Stephen."
"01;15;39;25","01;15;42;12","So it was mentioned that"
"01;15;43;12","01;15;44;08","there is the"
"01;15;44;08","01;15;45;10","embodiment of"
"01;15;45;10","01;15;46;06","certain prior"
"01;15;46;06","01;15;47;21","information in the continuous"
"01;15;47;21","01;15;48;21","attractor network."
"01;15;48;21","01;15;50;00","Like if my position is this"
"01;15;50;00","01;15;50;24","and I move forward,"
"01;15;50;24","01;15;51;24","then that is putting me"
"01;15;51;24","01;15;52;27","into this different position"
"01;15;52;27","01;15;55;28","in the can and"
"01;15;55;28","01;15;57;26","blue asked about topic modeling"
"01;15;57;26","01;15;58;28","and semantic spaces."
"01;15;58;28","01;16;01;14","So that territory is different."
"01;16;01;14","01;16;03;01","So the maps should be"
"01;16;03;01","01;16;04;20","appropriately different"
"01;16;04;20","01;16;06;17","and so we could say, for example,"
"01;16;06;17","01;16;09;14","like California is nested within"
"01;16;09;20","01;16;11;06","the United States,"
"01;16;11;06","01;16;12;15","that is not violating"
"01;16;12;15","01;16;14;22","any geographical priors."
"01;16;14;22","01;16;16;27","But what about a paper"
"01;16;16;27","01;16;18;23","that's interdisciplinary"
"01;16;18;23","01;16;20;20","that might be at the intersection"
"01;16;20;20","01;16;22;05","of two different topics"
"01;16;22;05","01;16;23;07","or depending on"
"01;16;23;07","01;16;25;14","how those topic models are generated,"
"01;16;26;10","01;16;28;05","one could think of every paper"
"01;16;28;05","01;16;29;26","as existing across"
"01;16;29;26","01;16;31;19","100 different topics"
"01;16;31;19","01;16;33;21","to different quantitative amounts"
"01;16;34;03","01;16;35;21","and so it actually does"
"01;16;35;21","01;16;36;19","bring us to this question"
"01;16;36;19","01;16;37;23","which it has asked,"
"01;16;37;23","01;16;39;27","which is we're hearing"
"01;16;39;27","01;16;43;01","a lot in the paper in the natural speech"
"01;16;43;09","01;16;45;08","and so on, different"
"01;16;46;06","01;16;48;15","complementarities"
"01;16;48;15","01;16;50;21","lower and higher."
"01;16;50;21","01;16;51;19","So here with the lower"
"01;16;51;19","01;16;53;19","model is the finer scale and the"
"01;16;53;19","01;16;54;11","the red."
"01;16;54;11","01;16;55;04","I'm not I'm trying"
"01;16;55;04","01;16;56;11","not to mix metaphors,"
"01;16;56;11","01;16;58;07","but lower and higher is"
"01;16;58;07","01;17;00;10","sometimes used with inner and outer"
"01;17;00;24","01;17;04;01","or finer and coarser core screening."
"01;17;04;01","01;17;05;14","More specific, more general."
"01;17;05;14","01;17;06;09","So"
"01;17;07;02","01;17;09;11","what is that restaurant"
"01;17;09;25","01;17;12;16","where those are the dishes"
"01;17;15;05","01;17;15;17","how could it"
"01;17;15;17","01;17;16;25","something be above or below"
"01;17;16;25","01;17;18;01","and you get it,"
"01;17;18;01","01;17;19;18","but it could also be more like a kernel"
"01;17;19;18","01;17;21;06","and more like the fruit."
"01;17;21;06","01;17;22;09","And you get it"
"01;17;22;09","01;17;23;20","and it could be more like sand"
"01;17;23;20","01;17;24;19","or more like gravel"
"01;17;24;19","01;17;26;01","and you would get it."
"01;17;26;07","01;17;29;23","What does that mean or say"
"01;17;36;02","01;17;36;18","well, think"
"01;17;36;18","01;17;39;29","and then allow Adam to speak first"
"01;18;02;27","01;18;03;20","I think that's a deep"
"01;18;03;20","01;18;06;06","and complex question."
"01;18;06;25","01;18;08;26","And there's a couple levels or a couple"
"01;18;08;28","01;18;10;01","entry points there, but"
"01;18;12;01","01;18;12;28","one thing"
"01;18;12;28","01;18;13;11","is, like"
"01;18;13;11","01;18;14;17","you mentioned, like inner and outer"
"01;18;14;17","01;18;15;16","is another way of describing,"
"01;18;15;16","01;18;16;28","I suppose, the higher and lower."
"01;18;16;28","01;18;19;00","And there's a,"
"01;18;19;00","01;18;19;19","I think, connection"
"01;18;19;19","01;18;21;04","between this art this late"
"01;18;21;04","01;18;23;04","and some architecture"
"01;18;23;05","01;18;24;05","and like"
"01;18;24;20","01;18;28;12","and metal learning where you're having"
"01;18;28;12","01;18;30;10","like a more fine grained process"
"01;18;30;10","01;18;31;07","for like"
"01;18;31;27","01;18;32;11","that's more"
"01;18;32;11","01;18;33;22","asks just this back"
"01;18;33;22","01;18;35;24","and forth for like adaptive fine"
"01;18;35;24","01;18;36;16","grained couplings."
"01;18;36;16","01;18;38;16","But then you nest that are there,"
"01;18;38;20","01;18;40;06","you create like an outer loop,"
"01;18;40;06","01;18;41;12","which is like a slower"
"01;18;41;12","01;18;43;23","aggregation process that's coarser"
"01;18;44;04","01;18;44;27","but then allows for"
"01;18;44;27","01;18;47;19","sharing of information across episodes."
"01;18;47;19","01;18;49;12","So it's a kind of like"
"01;18;49;28","01;18;50;18","this is basically"
"01;18;50;18","01;18;52;17","a kind of metal learning system"
"01;18;52;17","01;18;53;18","and giving you this divide"
"01;18;53;18","01;18;54;04","and conquer"
"01;18;54;04","01;18;56;16","approach of like levels of granularity,"
"01;18;58;00","01;19;00;26","I don't think anyone quite knows"
"01;19;01;17","01;19;04;03","gets what the significance of this is."
"01;19;04;03","01;19;05;18","But one interesting thing"
"01;19;05;18","01;19;06;20","about the grid cells,"
"01;19;06;20","01;19;08;29","as they seem to have"
"01;19;08;29","01;19;11;03","a multi scale hierarchy"
"01;19;11;06","01;19;13;03","in their organization"
"01;19;13;03","01;19;15;20","in terms of there's this axis I believe"
"01;19;15;21","01;19;17;11","is as you go"
"01;19;17;12","01;19;18;28","within entering the cortex, as"
"01;19;18;28","01;19;20;23","you go more like more"
"01;19;24;28","01;19;25;28","dorsal to"
"01;19;25;28","01;19;26;19","eventual or more"
"01;19;26;19","01;19;29;05","superior to the inferior"
"01;19;29;05","01;19;31;27","it you'll get these like"
"01;19;31;27","01;19;34;05","discrete cut offs of"
"01;19;35;12","01;19;37;12","potentially implants, kind of"
"01;19;37;12","01;19;38;29","harmonic nesting of scales,"
"01;19;38;29","01;19;40;07","maybe even coupling"
"01;19;40;07","01;19;41;14","with like multi scales,"
"01;19;41;14","01;19;44;01","like synchronous dynamics and cortex."
"01;19;44;01","01;19;45;02","Unclear,"
"01;19;45;24","01;19;47;04","but there does seem to be these"
"01;19;47;04","01;19;49;13","like multiple scales reflected"
"01;19;49;29","01;19;50;26","in the end"
"01;19;50;26","01;19;51;24","grid scales"
"01;19;51;24","01;19;52;29","and internal processes"
"01;19;52;29","01;19;55;17","having different levels of granularity"
"01;19;55;17","01;19;58;22","of their spatial representations"
"01;20;03;06","01;20;04;05","and the thing"
"01;20;04;05","01;20;04;24","that's interesting"
"01;20;04;24","01;20;06;11","I'm curious about is like"
"01;20;06;11","01;20;08;12","what are the one thing"
"01;20;08;12","01;20;10;14","I'm curious about is like"
"01;20;10;14","01;20;12;18","to what degree, for instance,"
"01;20;12;18","01;20;14;03","do differently neuro modular systems"
"01;20;14;03","01;20;16;04","like some of the ways in which like"
"01;20;16;04","01;20;17;28","they could be understood in terms of"
"01;20;17;28","01;20;19;08","having their functions"
"01;20;19;08","01;20;19;20","as maybe"
"01;20;19;20","01;20;21;08","like influencing"
"01;20;21;08","01;20;22;15","which granularity"
"01;20;22;15","01;20;26;03","is most present, like moving into like"
"01;20;26;12","01;20;27;18","now in a situation of like"
"01;20;27;18","01;20;29;22","attending to the fine granules"
"01;20;29;22","01;20;31;27","and or this is a situation"
"01;20;31;27","01;20;32;27","where we're going to really go"
"01;20;32;27","01;20;35;11","coarse and just ignore those details."
"01;20;35;21","01;20;36;10","And there's some"
"01;20;36;10","01;20;37;24","neurobiologist racisms there"
"01;20;39;06","01;20;40;22","and their effects"
"01;20;40;22","01;20;42;22","on like General Dynamics"
"01;20;42;22","01;20;44;08","might actually be best explained."
"01;20;44;08","01;20;44;27","It might be."
"01;20;44;27","01;20;45;12","Well, explain"
"01;20;45;12","01;20;46;25","in terms of this like adaptive"
"01;20;46;25","01;20;49;18","changing of the granularity"
"01;20;51;13","01;20;53;03","very cool."
"01;20;53;03","01;20;55;09","And we see that in teamwork"
"01;20;55;09","01;20;56;00","where sometimes"
"01;20;56;00","01;20;58;04","it's time to control paced"
"01;20;58;04","01;21;00;02","and just fill out the spreadsheet."
"01;21;00;02","01;21;00;23","Other times it's"
"01;21;00;23","01;21;02;27","time to add a column to the spreadsheet."
"01;21;03;06","01;21;04;13","Other times there are"
"01;21;04;13","01;21;05;14","this open ended ness"
"01;21;05;14","01;21;06;11","to the task"
"01;21;06;11","01;21;07;17","and including"
"01;21;07;17","01;21;09;20","the local objectives"
"01;21;09;20","01;21;11;09","and also even broader"
"01;21;11;09","01;21;12;10","mission and one's"
"01;21;12;10","01;21;13;09","own relationship"
"01;21;13;09","01;21;14;15","to the team and the project."
"01;21;14;15","01;21;15;08","So"
"01;21;16;22","01;21;18;05","perhaps if there's a similar"
"01;21;18;05","01;21;20;16","biological substrate,"
"01;21;20;16","01;21;22;09","then it would stand to reason"
"01;21;22;09","01;21;24;10","that there could be multiple"
"01;21;24;10","01;21;26;00","representations that are emitted"
"01;21;26;00","01;21;27;11","from some kind of common"
"01;21;27;11","01;21;29;14","generative model."
"01;21;30;03","01;21;32;14","I'm one up for forget."
"01;21;33;15","01;21;34;24","So one thing that I'm"
"01;21;34;24","01;21;36;10","actually really interested in"
"01;21;36;10","01;21;38;22","is exploring these same principles"
"01;21;39;02","01;21;41;03","and the in case because they have like"
"01;21;42;07","01;21;42;28","analogous and"
"01;21;42;28","01;21;44;29","potentially largely homologous systems"
"01;21;44;29","01;21;46;28","of the central complex."
"01;21;46;28","01;21;50;03","And I feel like that's like an area"
"01;21;50;03","01;21;51;19","like I'm looking to look into"
"01;21;51;19","01;21;52;20","next is like"
"01;21;52;20","01;21;53;29","to really understand these things,"
"01;21;53;29","01;21;55;21","not just looking at the mammal case,"
"01;21;55;21","01;21;56;28","but when I look at the inset case"
"01;21;56;28","01;21;57;29","with the central complex"
"01;21;57;29","01;21;58;26","and see the similarities"
"01;21;58;26","01;21;59;28","and differences,"
"01;21;59;28","01;22;00;15","what"
"01;22;00;23","01;22;03;22","what special adaptations were there,"
"01;22;03;22","01;22;04;21","what to what"
"01;22;04;21","01;22;05;22","extent are the functions realized"
"01;22;05;22","01;22;07;02","by similar means are different means."
"01;22;07;02","01;22;09;12","But there's some in terms"
"01;22;09;12","01;22;09;21","of like"
"01;22;09;21","01;22;10;25","a way of understanding things"
"01;22;10;25","01;22;11;16","like like that"
"01;22;11;16","01;22;12;08","neuro modulator"
"01;22;12;08","01;22;13;21","hypothesis of like influencing"
"01;22;13;21","01;22;16;03","like the granularity of spatial modeling"
"01;22;16;03","01;22;17;03","as possible,"
"01;22;17;03","01;22;19;08","although I wouldn't necessarily"
"01;22;20;10","01;22;22;22","bet on outcome based on conversations"
"01;22;22;22","01;22;24;08","with you, David, but"
"01;22;25;02","01;22;26;20","it's possible that you're getting like"
"01;22;26;20","01;22;28;21","extensive homology and common"
"01;22;28;21","01;22;31;20","significances for things like flexible"
"01;22;31;28","01;22;33;03","influencing of the granularity"
"01;22;33;03","01;22;34;15","and the forging parameters."
"01;22;34;15","01;22;35;04","It's possible"
"01;22;35;04","01;22;37;22","those are like remarkably conserved"
"01;22;37;28","01;22;39;19","and that you might actually see them."
"01;22;39;19","01;22;40;21","That being said,"
"01;22;40;21","01;22;42;18","like you also were alluding to, though,"
"01;22;42;18","01;22;44;05","the salmon since is different"
"01;22;44;05","01;22;45;19","in insects about this is"
"01;22;45;19","01;22;46;25","this is a multi slam"
"01;22;47;27","01;22;48;15","in general."
"01;22;48;15","01;22;50;22","There's a lot of what is happening"
"01;22;50;22","01;22;52;00","in vertebrates also,"
"01;22;52;00","01;22;53;13","but I think not to the same degree"
"01;22;53;13","01;22;53;25","and that"
"01;22;53;25","01;22;54;19","so you might expect"
"01;22;54;19","01;22;56;25","some potentially substantial differences"
"01;22;56;25","01;22;59;00","there as a result of"
"01;22;59;00","01;22;59;23","the same problem"
"01;22;59;23","01;23;01;10","being having that additional way."
"01;23;01;10","01;23;03;10","It's different set of challenges and"
"01;23;06;10","01;23;09;12","sources of information I can leverage."
"01;23;09;20","01;23;12;08","I can't wait for solitary wasp slam"
"01;23;12;22","01;23;15;20","and you social colony slam even"
"01;23;18;09","01;23;19;17","from what I'm hearing you could"
"01;23;19;17","01;23;20;20","you could correlate"
"01;23;20;20","01;23;22;05","these multi slams"
"01;23;22;05","01;23;24;16","to regimes of attention in many ways"
"01;23;24;16","01;23;25;13","because"
"01;23;25;16","01;23;28;02","that that could take the nature"
"01;23;28;02","01;23;30;25","of these granularity and where they are"
"01;23;31;17","01;23;34;09","in the space, in the place in the body."
"01;23;34;15","01;23;35;16","So"
"01;23;36;03","01;23;39;00","because we often assume I think"
"01;23;39;07","01;23;42;02","when blue is saying they're about"
"01;23;42;02","01;23;44;13","there's this inner outer"
"01;23;44;13","01;23;46;05","and the sum of those are also"
"01;23;46;05","01;23;47;17","false assumptions"
"01;23;47;17","01;23;50;02","that that rolls out over everything"
"01;23;50;17","01;23;53;13","that we so in the sense that in"
"01;23;53;13","01;23;56;05","a is pure"
"01;23;56;14","01;23;59;09","and higher is pure but often"
"01;24;00;08","01;24;02;19","that might depend on the multi slam"
"01;24;03;05","01;24;04;23","that's been done at the time"
"01;24;06;20","01;24;07;09","yeah."
"01;24;07;09","01;24;08;08","Like one"
"01;24;08;08","01;24;09;20","other than blue, like coarser"
"01;24;09;20","01;24;11;17","and finer, slower and faster."
"01;24;11;17","01;24;13;05","So one interpretation"
"01;24;13;05","01;24;13;14","would be"
"01;24;13;14","01;24;14;21","that the slower time scale"
"01;24;14;21","01;24;17;00","is the coarser draining"
"01;24;17;00","01;24;18;14","in the sense that it's like seconds,"
"01;24;18;14","01;24;19;07","not milliseconds,"
"01;24;19;07","01;24;22;16","and the finer is the faster."
"01;24;22;16","01;24;25;04","But there's also maybe an interpretation"
"01;24;25;04","01;24;26;16","where actually the"
"01;24;26;16","01;24;28;08","if you're clicking up mile by mile"
"01;24;28;08","01;24;29;29","instead of foot by foot,"
"01;24;29;29","01;24;31;09","that is actually moving faster"
"01;24;31;09","01;24;32;12","and it's coarser."
"01;24;32;12","01;24;33;27","And if you're counting grains of sand"
"01;24;33;27","01;24;36;07","at a time, it's finer and slower."
"01;24;36;17","01;24;38;29","So I think even sometimes the direction"
"01;24;39;04","01;24;40;28","that one interprets"
"01;24;40;28","01;24;41;20","is not there,"
"01;24;41;20","01;24;42;23","but it doesn't remove"
"01;24;42;23","01;24;44;14","the dialectical nature"
"01;24;44;14","01;24;45;26","or the intermodal nature."
"01;24;45;26","01;24;48;21","But the way that is, it going to be like"
"01;24;51;04","01;24;52;23","a sugar with all the O-H"
"01;24;52;23","01;24;53;18","is pointing down"
"01;24;53;18","01;24;56;06","or all the O-H is pointing up or some"
"01;24;56;18","01;24;57;02","blend"
"01;24;58;10","01;24;59;22","has to go one way or the other."
"01;24;59;22","01;25;00;16","But"
"01;25;00;21","01;25;02;09","maybe it doesn't have to be"
"01;25;02;09","01;25;04;24","any one specific way."
"01;25;04;24","01;25;05;12","Blue"
"01;25;07;17","01;25;09;19","so I am wondering,"
"01;25;09;19","01;25;11;09","and this is also interesting"
"01;25;11;09","01;25;13;12","in terms of the insects case,"
"01;25;13;12","01;25;16;00","if there is some kind of"
"01;25;16;00","01;25;19;10","maybe like a generic pre installed"
"01;25;19;11","01;25;20;18","like readily"
"01;25;20;18","01;25;21;19","adaptable course"
"01;25;21;19","01;25;23;17","screened version of a place."
"01;25;23;17","01;25;25;17","So like that's just"
"01;25;25;17","01;25;25;28","kind of"
"01;25;25;28","01;25;27;21","there is like a generic representation."
"01;25;27;21","01;25;30;01","So like a perfect example."
"01;25;30;12","01;25;31;15","I mean, when you're thinking"
"01;25;31;15","01;25;32;11","about screening"
"01;25;32;11","01;25;33;25","like a map at a location,"
"01;25;33;25","01;25;34;26","like you know where everything is"
"01;25;34;26","01;25;35;17","in your house, like,"
"01;25;35;17","01;25;36;17","you know, where your bathroom is"
"01;25;36;17","01;25;38;11","and you know where all the things are."
"01;25;38;11","01;25;39;28","But you know, when you travel,"
"01;25;39;28","01;25;41;20","you have an expectation."
"01;25;41;20","01;25;42;17","Even if you've never been"
"01;25;42;17","01;25;44;00","to the hotel before,"
"01;25;44;00","01;25;45;11","you have the expectation of what"
"01;25;45;11","01;25;46;29","the elevator's going to sound like,"
"01;25;46;29","01;25;47;24","how the carpet"
"01;25;47;24","01;25;48;18","all looks the same"
"01;25;48;18","01;25;49;18","with that funky, weird"
"01;25;49;18","01;25;51;18","pattern in the hallways, twist and turn."
"01;25;51;18","01;25;52;25","And like"
"01;25;52;25","01;25;54;00","when you get into the hotel room,"
"01;25;54;00","01;25;55;05","there's going to be a bathroom"
"01;25;55;05","01;25;56;06","and there's going to be a window"
"01;25;56;06","01;25;57;00","and there's going to be bed"
"01;25;57;00","01;25;58;05","and a TV and a remote."
"01;25;58;05","01;26;01;04","So you have this like pre generic"
"01;26;01;27","01;26;02;25","supposition of how"
"01;26;02;25","01;26;04;04","the hotel is going to look."
"01;26;04;04","01;26;05;15","Does that live in a place?"
"01;26;05;15","01;26;06;02","So somewhere"
"01;26;06;02","01;26;08;12","that just like morphs into, oh,"
"01;26;08;13","01;26;09;21","the bathrooms here and the lights here"
"01;26;09;21","01;26;10;28","so that you're not stumbling around"
"01;26;10;28","01;26;12;13","in the middle of the night."
"01;26;12;13","01;26;13;13","And similarly, like,"
"01;26;13;13","01;26;14;04","there's all kinds of"
"01;26;14;04","01;26;15;13","when you go out hiking,"
"01;26;15;13","01;26;15;20","you know,"
"01;26;15;20","01;26;17;16","you expect there to be trees"
"01;26;17;16","01;26;19;10","and rocks and stuff outside."
"01;26;19;10","01;26;20;02","And so"
"01;26;20;02","01;26;20;28","do you just like"
"01;26;20;28","01;26;22;24","mash your map on"
"01;26;22;24","01;26;25;04","to like some preexisting generic"
"01;26;26;01","01;26;28;15","place holder a place so place holder."
"01;26;29;07","01;26;30;10","It's interesting to think about"
"01;26;35;07","01;26;37;18","it's like a prior for the abstract"
"01;26;37;23","01;26;39;22","space prior distribution"
"01;26;39;22","01;26;40;20","over hotel rooms,"
"01;26;40;20","01;26;42;02","which is totally in culture"
"01;26;42;02","01;26;44;08","and totally based upon experience."
"01;26;44;08","01;26;46;08","And then either one is surprised or not"
"01;26;46;08","01;26;50;16","just as with when any other prior meets"
"01;26;51;16","01;26;53;19","sense I'm Adam."
"01;26;53;19","01;26;55;29","What do you think of that, Steve?"
"01;26;56;28","01;26;57;29","I mean, these are"
"01;26;58;21","01;27;00;25","details that are definitely"
"01;27;00;28","01;27;03;16","out here beyond the edge of anything I"
"01;27;03;16","01;27;06;04","or maybe anyone knows, but the"
"01;27;07;26","01;27;11;10","I guess I like these"
"01;27;11;19","01;27;13;22","how many different"
"01;27;13;23","01;27;15;06","so one way that these"
"01;27;15;06","01;27;17;19","place feels or sometimes modeled"
"01;27;17;19","01;27;18;05","is in terms"
"01;27;18;05","01;27;20;06","of like these like chained attractors"
"01;27;20;22","01;27;21;05","and so like"
"01;27;21;05","01;27;22;13","within the hippocampus system,"
"01;27;22;13","01;27;23;24","like you can get like this"
"01;27;23;24","01;27;25;27","highly recurrent activity,"
"01;27;25;27","01;27;28;02","especially in some of the sub fields"
"01;27;28;02","01;27;30;06","and you can set up like that"
"01;27;30;07","01;27;31;16","this such of"
"01;27;33;16","01;27;33;26","like these"
"01;27;33;26","01;27;35;29","densities of"
"01;27;37;08","01;27;38;08","return activity."
"01;27;38;08","01;27;39;13","And then you can have like information"
"01;27;39;13","01;27;40;10","kind of moving"
"01;27;40;10","01;27;42;23","between them as a predictive map,"
"01;27;42;23","01;27;44;03","not just of like"
"01;27;44;03","01;27;46;03","not just like here's the things,"
"01;27;46;03","01;27;47;21","but you know, people"
"01;27;47;21","01;27;48;15","that have better things."
"01;27;48;15","01;27;49;13","Like Gershman talks"
"01;27;49;13","01;27;50;22","about census representations,"
"01;27;50;22","01;27;53;01","but there's a transition structure"
"01;27;53;01","01;27;55;01","of which a chapter will act."
"01;27;55;01","01;27;56;21","Which of the places will activate"
"01;27;56;21","01;27;59;06","first in the sequence."
"01;27;59;06","01;27;59;29","And"
"01;28;01;03","01;28;02;16","and so I guess the question,"
"01;28;02;16","01;28;02;28","the question"
"01;28;02;28","01;28;03;25","I'm wondering is like so like,"
"01;28;03;25","01;28;04;04","you know, you're"
"01;28;04;04","01;28;05;13","encountering like a new scene"
"01;28;05;13","01;28;06;21","and you're like laying down"
"01;28;06;21","01;28;08;08","like a set of landmarks"
"01;28;08;08","01;28;09;24","or a timeline of space."
"01;28;09;24","01;28;12;23","Like to what degree is"
"01;28;12;23","01;28;15;06","this information encoded in"
"01;28;16;13","01;28;17;24","in what circumstances"
"01;28;17;24","01;28;19;13","and to what degree is it"
"01;28;19;13","01;28;21;25","encoded in like the local connectivity"
"01;28;21;25","01;28;22;26","within that mechanical system?"
"01;28;22;26","01;28;24;02","And whether you're getting like this"
"01;28;24;02","01;28;25;25","set of schemas"
"01;28;25;25","01;28;26;22","that you're going to like drop"
"01;28;26;22","01;28;28;09","like the most similar one"
"01;28;28;09","01;28;32;05","based on some degree of similarity"
"01;28;32;05","01;28;32;18","will cause"
"01;28;32;18","01;28;34;03","like one attractor"
"01;28;34;03","01;28;34;11","that works"
"01;28;34;11","01;28;35;29","to get pulled up over another."
"01;28;35;29","01;28;37;01","And now this is the challenge"
"01;28;37;01","01;28;37;20","you're working within."
"01;28;37;20","01;28;38;24","And this is like"
"01;28;38;28","01;28;39;22","the policies"
"01;28;39;22","01;28;40;29","that the policy set"
"01;28;40;29","01;28;42;15","you're likely to be pulling from."
"01;28;42;15","01;28;43;28","And this is your framing of the domain"
"01;28;45;20","01;28;46;00","or to"
"01;28;46;00","01;28;48;13","what degree is it relying more heavily"
"01;28;49;00","01;28;50;25","on like the moments of moments"
"01;28;50;25","01;28;52;02","like cortical dynamics"
"01;28;52;02","01;28;53;18","and like the mental simulation"
"01;28;53;18","01;28;54;26","that might be happening"
"01;28;54;26","01;28;58;06","and to what extent is it constrained"
"01;28;59;06","01;29;01;13","by the history of plasticity"
"01;29;01;21","01;29;03;02","within the hippocampus?"
"01;29;03;02","01;29;05;29","What schemas are going to be operative"
"01;29;05;29","01;29;06;27","and to what degree is"
"01;29;06;27","01;29;09;14","it more of a negotiation"
"01;29;09;14","01;29;11;25","where it's going to be more abstract,"
"01;29;12;05","01;29;13;07","more determined"
"01;29;13;07","01;29;14;21","by the moments when the contingencies"
"01;29;14;21","01;29;15;14","and this funneling"
"01;29;15;14","01;29;17;17","through the whole like"
"01;29;17;17","01;29;19;20","cortical virtual reality machinery,"
"01;29;19;20","01;29;21;05","everyone's sick of it."
"01;29;21;26","01;29;24;00","And to what degree is this"
"01;29;24;00","01;29;25;05","that there's not one answer?"
"01;29;25;05","01;29;26;12","This varies both across"
"01;29;26;12","01;29;28;06","and within individuals."
"01;29;28;06","01;29;29;24","This is actually like"
"01;29;29;24","01;29;31;17","a core aspect of cybernetic functioning."
"01;29;31;17","01;29;33;08","This is actually leaning"
"01;29;33;08","01;29;33;29","more heavily"
"01;29;33;29","01;29;36;09","on the progress or the current"
"01;29;36;11","01;29;37;28","of established"
"01;29;39;13","01;29;41;17","over more of more learning and exploring"
"01;29;41;17","01;29;42;10","or leaning more on"
"01;29;42;10","01;29;44;14","like the situationally specific factors"
"01;29;44;24","01;29;46;03","like how much do you shoehorn"
"01;29;46;03","01;29;46;19","what's going on"
"01;29;46;19","01;29;48;05","into your existing schemas,"
"01;29;48;05","01;29;49;01","how much you assimilate,"
"01;29;49;01","01;29;50;11","how much do you accommodate?"
"01;29;50;11","01;29;50;27","And at this thing,"
"01;29;50;27","01;29;53;07","potentially like a flexible parameter"
"01;29;53;07","01;29;54;23","and maybe some of that flexibility is"
"01;29;54;23","01;29;55;27","like is"
"01;29;55;27","01;29;57;08","like baked into the logic"
"01;29;57;08","01;29;58;09","of neuro modulators,"
"01;29;58;09","01;29;59;20","like actually"
"01;29;59;20","01;30;02;19","flexibly influencing is unclear, but"
"01;30;03;19","01;30;05;10","they're very free as of anything."
"01;30;05;10","01;30;07;11","But it's very much like"
"01;30;07;11","01;30;08;07","part of the excitement"
"01;30;08;07","01;30;10;10","for me is like wondering like"
"01;30;10;26","01;30;12;24","is this like"
"01;30;14;19","01;30;15;21","does this provide"
"01;30;15;21","01;30;16;25","like a functional"
"01;30;16;25","01;30;18;02","and algorithmic significance"
"01;30;18;02","01;30;19;13","for like this?"
"01;30;19;13","01;30;20;09","Like otherwise"
"01;30;20;09","01;30;21;23","like just mass of"
"01;30;21;23","01;30;23;16","like biological details, like"
"01;30;23;16","01;30;24;13","do some of them have like"
"01;30;24;13","01;30;27;01","elegant cybernetic understandings"
"01;30;27;01","01;30;28;22","by virtue of like"
"01;30;28;22","01;30;30;02","thinking of these kinds of questions?"
"01;30;31;14","01;30;32;24","Can I just respond?"
"01;30;32;24","01;30;34;02","Yes, please. The"
"01;30;35;04","01;30;37;10","so that made me think a whole bunch"
"01;30;37;10","01;30;38;03","about like"
"01;30;38;03","01;30;41;01","maybe we don't need a map, a place self"
"01;30;41;02","01;30;42;20","for each individual hotel room"
"01;30;42;20","01;30;44;03","but it's like a node"
"01;30;44;03","01;30;44;17","when we're"
"01;30;44;17","01;30;45;27","discussing nodes earlier,"
"01;30;45;27","01;30;46;25","like a core screens,"
"01;30;46;25","01;30;48;12","just an attractive space"
"01;30;48;12","01;30;49;01","like dump"
"01;30;49;01","01;30;50;02","all of the hotel room"
"01;30;50;02","01;30;52;03","maps into this little nodules."
"01;30;52;03","01;30;52;12","So that"
"01;30;52;12","01;30;53;29","when you get to a hotel room, it's"
"01;30;53;29","01;30;55;21","all the same thing."
"01;30;55;21","01;30;56;17","Like it's OK."
"01;30;56;17","01;30;57;06","I've been here before,"
"01;30;57;06","01;30;58;01","even if you've never been"
"01;30;58;01","01;30;59;09","to that kind of place."
"01;30;59;09","01;31;01;00","And that would kind of explain things"
"01;31;01;00","01;31;02;10","like Deja Vu,"
"01;31;02;10","01;31;03;15","like when you get to a place"
"01;31;03;15","01;31;04;19","like I've been here before,"
"01;31;04;19","01;31;05;14","when did I come here?"
"01;31;05;14","01;31;06;06","Like when you're driving down"
"01;31;06;06","01;31;06;22","a street, didn't"
"01;31;06;22","01;31;07;25","I just drive down the street?"
"01;31;08;24","01;31;09;09","It just"
"01;31;09;09","01;31;09;26","lumped over"
"01;31;09;26","01;31;12;07","there into that little attractor"
"01;31;12;07","01;31;13;16","mesh node"
"01;31;13;16","01;31;14;18","that's not necessarily"
"01;31;14;18","01;31;16;05","a specific place,"
"01;31;16;05","01;31;17;01","but just like a"
"01;31;17;01","01;31;19;08","squishy ball of similar places"
"01;31;21;03","01;31;23;18","and also really love how we spoke"

"01;31;25;10","01;31;27;06","Adam and your collaboration"

"01;31;58;28","01;32;00;08","Yeah, you could go a bit further"
"01;32;00;08","01;32;01;22","still because"
"01;32;01;22","01;32;03;12","what if you don't have maps"
"01;32;03;12","01;32;05;04","put to one side that"
"01;32;05;04","01;32;06;22","this action policies"
"01;32;08;02","01;32;08;25","actually have interest in"
"01;32;08;25","01;32;09;26","how much this is feasible,"
"01;32;09;26","01;32;10;16","but action"
"01;32;10;16","01;32;12;16","policies that recapitulate"
"01;32;12;16","01;32;14;14","something like a map,"
"01;32;14;14","01;32;16;15","so like by an embodiment,"
"01;32;16;15","01;32;18;01","by an inactive chain"
"01;32;18;01","01;32;20;12","of or initiation of some actions"
"01;32;20;21","01;32;22;06","at different scales,"
"01;32;22;06","01;32;23;24","it basically recapitulates"
"01;32;23;24","01;32;27;13","some sort of nascent starting point."
"01;32;27;25","01;32;28;26","So you don't have to have"
"01;32;28;26","01;32;30;16","any representations there."
"01;32;30;16","01;32;34;05","And like when the door is engaged,"
"01;32;34;19","01;32;38;15","the set of actions that that does"
"01;32;38;24","01;32;40;25","that creates could open up"
"01;32;41;12","01;32;44;04","an effectively a map."
"01;32;44;04","01;32;45;24","So I don't know how much between"
"01;32;45;24","01;32;46;10","I mean, I know"
"01;32;46;10","01;32;46;27","in this model"
"01;32;46;27","01;32;47;26","it does"
"01;32;47;26","01;32;50;10","start to create a network of attractors,"
"01;32;50;10","01;32;50;26","but I'm wondering"
"01;32;50;26","01;32;52;07","whether how much"
"01;32;52;07","01;32;54;22","things could be sparked off"
"01;32;54;22","01;32;58;03","from engage in a particular affordance,"
"01;32;58;03","01;33;00;21","a particular meaningfulness in something"
"01;33;04;17","01;33;05;01","I mean,"
"01;33;06;00","01;33;08;13","there's actually like a live debate"
"01;33;08;13","01;33;10;13","about like the extent to which"
"01;33;11;20","01;33;11;29","it's like"
"01;33;11;29","01;33;13;03","Tolman initially was talking"
"01;33;13;03","01;33;15;04","about the hippocampal cognitive memory."
"01;33;15;04","01;33;16;14","And part of the reason"
"01;33;16;14","01;33;17;25","people like to talk about maps"
"01;33;17;25","01;33;19;12","is because of the"
"01;33;19;12","01;33;22;02","flexibility they give you in terms of"
"01;33;23;05","01;33;24;20","if you"
"01;33;24;28","01;33;25;16","like, the map"
"01;33;25;16","01;33;26;27","serves as a generative model"
"01;33;26;27","01;33;28;28","and like it gives you like a"
"01;33;31;18","01;33;33;09","like I can flexibly actually set"
"01;33;33;09","01;33;35;08","to generate trajectories,"
"01;33;35;08","01;33;36;15","but you can do that with a well"
"01;33;36;15","01;33;37;22","structured graph also,"
"01;33;37;22","01;33;38;18","but there's like a spectrum"
"01;33;38;18","01;33;40;18","of interpretations of people thinking"
"01;33;41;21","01;33;42;01","that you're"
"01;33;42;01","01;33;43;09","dealing with more things"
"01;33;43;09","01;33;43;27","that are more map"
"01;33;43;27","01;33;46;12","like and things that are more"
"01;33;47;19","01;33;49;26","context specific and graphs like"
"01;33;50;12","01;33;51;20","and flexible"
"01;33;51;20","01;33;53;12","and more dynamically constructed."
"01;33;53;12","01;33;57;07","And it seems like"
"01;33;58;24","01;33;59;22","it's kind of a cop up."
"01;33;59;22","01;34;00;21","And I'm like,"
"01;34;00;21","01;34;01;16","I always like"
"01;34;01;16","01;34;02;05","take every debate"
"01;34;02;05","01;34;02;21","and I'm like, you're"
"01;34;02;21","01;34;03;26","probably both right."
"01;34;03;26","01;34;06;04","And so it's like you want like"
"01;34;06;08","01;34;07;17","for the sake of I guess"
"01;34;07;17","01;34;11;02","maybe stability or for the sake of"
"01;34;12;07","01;34;12;25","potentially greater"
"01;34;12;25","01;34;15;06","transfer of understandings"
"01;34;15;06","01;34;17;07","and inferential power across episodes."
"01;34;17;07","01;34;19;06","You might want something more map like,"
"01;34;19;06","01;34;20;19","but if you go to map"
"01;34;20;19","01;34;21;06","like you're"
"01;34;21;06","01;34;22;18","losing like"
"01;34;22;18","01;34;23;14","the ability to deal"
"01;34;23;14","01;34;24;12","like the nuances"
"01;34;24;12","01;34;27;10","of like specific context and so,"
"01;34;29;00","01;34;30;24","you know, so this again"
"01;34;30;24","01;34;32;03","might be like different perspectives"
"01;34;32;03","01;34;32;27","on the same thing"
"01;34;32;27","01;34;35;03","that tend to converge with tradeoffs."
"01;34;35;03","01;34;36;26","Like you could have"
"01;34;36;26","01;34;38;20","more context sensitive"
"01;34;38;20","01;34;40;13","or more situationally"
"01;34;40;13","01;34;41;20","invariant representations,"
"01;34;41;20","01;34;43;05","and these could reflect"
"01;34;43;05","01;34;44;08","cognitive styles"
"01;34;44;08","01;34;46;11","and maybe like fundamental axes"
"01;34;46;15","01;34;47;24","of variation"
"01;34;47;24","01;34;51;12","for cognition and sense making"
"01;34;53;01","01;34;53;17","yeah."
"01;34;53;17","01;34;56;14","The one thing that"
"01;34;58;03","01;35;00;06","in terms of like cybernetics"
"01;35;00;18","01;35;02;10","generally of like earlier like,"
"01;35;02;10","01;35;03;28","you know, like drawing Peterson"
"01;35;03;28","01;35;04;19","like parties."
"01;35;04;19","01;35;06;01","Like it's actually interesting"
"01;35;06;01","01;35;08;01","that maps of meeting"
"01;35;08;01","01;35;09;11","Peterson's book"
"01;35;09;11","01;35;11;23","was actually heavily informed by"
"01;35;12;22","01;35;15;00","concepts and affective neuroscience"
"01;35;15;00","01;35;16;13","and ecological models"
"01;35;16;13","01;35;17;03","more generally,"
"01;35;17;03","01;35;18;08","like based on things"
"01;35;18;08","01;35;19;20","like animal foraging."
"01;35;19;20","01;35;20;16","So I actually think that's"
"01;35;20;16","01;35;21;15","where Jordan Peterson got"
"01;35;21;15","01;35;22;10","that rhetoric about"
"01;35;22;10","01;35;23;25","maps is actually"
"01;35;23;25","01;35;24;05","from doing"
"01;35;24;05","01;35;24;15","a kind"
"01;35;24;15","01;35;26;06","of affective neuroscience"
"01;35;26;06","01;35;28;08","perspective grounded"
"01;35;28;08","01;35;30;17","in this ecological perspective."
"01;35;30;25","01;35;33;03","Of foraging animals."
"01;35;33;03","01;35;34;11","And so,"
"01;35;34;16","01;35;35;18","yeah, I think that's actually where"
"01;35;35;18","01;35;36;07","that came from."
"01;35;37;24","01;35;39;10","Yes, very nice."
"01;35;39;10","01;35;39;27","And I"
"01;35;39;27","01;35;40;15","think I"
"01;35;40;15","01;35;42;06","agree, and we may have even"
"01;35;42;06","01;35;43;28","explored as such"
"01;35;43;28","01;35;46;11","in, in one paper reimagining maps"
"01;35;46;11","01;35;46;28","that I wrote"
"01;35;46;28","01;35;49;04","with RJ and a colleague Michael"
"01;35;50;08","01;35;51;08","we learned about this"
"01;35;51;08","01;35;52;09","historical distinction"
"01;35;52;09","01;35;53;17","between archival maps"
"01;35;53;17","01;35;54;29","and itinerary maps."
"01;35;54;29","01;35;55;14","And today"
"01;35;55;14","01;35;56;13","we just think about maps"
"01;35;56;13","01;35;58;17","as being like one more lumpy category."
"01;35;58;17","01;35;59;22","But there's many differences"
"01;35;59;22","01;36;00;22","between the map"
"01;36;00;22","01;36;01;12","that actually"
"01;36;01;12","01;36;03;03","is like a multi map"
"01;36;03;03","01;36;05;05","or a mega map and holds"
"01;36;05;05","01;36;06;03","a lot of information"
"01;36;06;03","01;36;08;13","potentially in a metric way"
"01;36;08;13","01;36;10;10","versus the itinerary map."
"01;36;10;10","01;36;10;29","Head straight"
"01;36;10;29","01;36;12;22","until you see the two big trees."
"01;36;12;22","01;36;13;07","Then you're going"
"01;36;13;07","01;36;14;19","to want to take a left,"
"01;36;14;19","01;36;15;09","that type"
"01;36;15;09","01;36;16;01","of more"
"01;36;16;01","01;36;17;01","conversational"
"01;36;17;01","01;36;19;29","or casual or navigable map"
"01;36;20;05","01;36;22;09","that is highly contextual"
"01;36;22;09","01;36;23;21","and with current map systems."
"01;36;23;21","01;36;24;23","That's one of the challenges"
"01;36;24;23","01;36;27;07","because we have that mega map."
"01;36;27;07","01;36;28;04","It's downloadable,"
"01;36;28;04","01;36;29;28","but it's not going to fit on your phone."
"01;36;29;28","01;36;32;14","So what is the projection"
"01;36;32;25","01;36;35;12","that's contextual and situational"
"01;36;35;12","01;36;36;00","that's actually going"
"01;36;36;00","01;36;37;22","to enable effective action"
"01;36;38;24","01;36;40;14","that is also going to be perceived"
"01;36;40;14","01;36;42;21","as map like by the user on"
"01;36;44;14","01;36;45;17","yes, blue"
"01;36;48;13","01;36;49;12","OK, so"
"01;36;49;12","01;36;49;24","this is like"
"01;36;49;24","01;36;52;19","a personal attack in question."
"01;36;52;19","01;36;54;14","So anybody who spent any kind of time"
"01;36;54;14","01;36;55;01","with Daniel"
"01;36;55;01","01;36;57;24","knows that he's constantly drawing"
"01;36;58;06","01;36;59;04","or writing"
"01;36;59;04","01;37;00;21","or writing things down"
"01;37;00;21","01;37;02;03","like all the time taking notes, taking"
"01;37;02;03","01;37;03;04","notes, taking notes."
"01;37;03;04","01;37;04;07","And I wonder, like,"
"01;37;04;07","01;37;06;06","can you take your notes"
"01;37;06;06","01;37;09;00","as like a mental map of where you were"
"01;37;09;00","01;37;09;19","at that time"
"01;37;09;19","01;37;11;04","that you were making that drawing like"
"01;37;11;04","01;37;12;15","it does it like"
"01;37;12;15","01;37;14;25","recapitulate your conversations"
"01;37;14;25","01;37;15;28","that you're having the ideas"
"01;37;15;28","01;37;16;14","that were running through"
"01;37;16;14","01;37;16;27","your head, like"
"01;37;16;27","01;37;18;12","can you use these drawings"
"01;37;18;12","01;37;19;05","that you're always doing"
"01;37;19;05","01;37;21;24","as like a kind of conversational,"
"01;37;21;24","01;37;23;27","like mental space map"
"01;37;26;12","01;37;29;02","if anything, it's the opposite."
"01;37;29;02","01;37;31;06","I just leave the thought behind."
"01;37;31;06","01;37;32;28","And if we look at this and think, OK,"
"01;37;32;28","01;37;33;24","something happened"
"01;37;33;24","01;37;35;20","by which we wrote this down"
"01;37;35;20","01;37;36;14","it would be awesome"
"01;37;36;14","01;37;37;20","if there were as"
"01;37;37;20","01;37;40;00","many people with a regime of attention"
"01;37;40;00","01;37;41;11","on taking live notes."
"01;37;41;11","01;37;42;17","I know that's not an approach"
"01;37;42;17","01;37;43;17","for everybody,"
"01;37;43;17","01;37;45;04","but then we could all look at that"
"01;37;45;04","01;37;47;06","Shared Ferryman distribution"
"01;37;47;23","01;37;49;26","and then make it new again."
"01;37;49;26","01;37;51;17","And maybe we remember"
"01;37;51;17","01;37;54;05","our exact previous thought, though."
"01;37;54;05","01;37;56;15","That's impossible. Or or unlikely."
"01;37;56;26","01;37;59;28","But instead we can make the relationship"
"01;37;59;28","01;38;00;27","with the material"
"01;38;00;27","01;38;02;17","and with those notes like new again."
"01;38;03;18","01;38;04;10","Stephen"
"01;38;06;09","01;38;07;17","Yes, maybe a little harder"
"01;38;07;17","01;38;09;09","to categorize with language,"
"01;38;09;09","01;38;12;22","but in a way it's the traces of"
"01;38;13;18","01;38;15;23","your action policies."
"01;38;15;23","01;38;18;13","Even if it was captured in"
"01;38;18;13","01;38;19;18","the interpretation."
"01;38;19;18","01;38;21;19","So one thing I'm very interested in"
"01;38;21;19","01;38;24;20","is how we can realign things to action"
"01;38;25;26","01;38;28;24","because we've kind of been enculturated"
"01;38;28;24","01;38;30;18","to think it's all about thoughts"
"01;38;30;18","01;38;31;27","and feelings, right?"
"01;38;31;27","01;38;33;20","And because Action"
"01;38;33;20","01;38;34;13","Act of inference"
"01;38;34;13","01;38;36;07","puts it in this other domain, well,"
"01;38;36;07","01;38;38;10","what does that mean?"
"01;38;38;10","01;38;40;12","And how do we talk about"
"01;38;40;12","01;38;41;07","active inference"
"01;38;41;07","01;38;41;21","when we're"
"01;38;41;21","01;38;44;07","coaching culture to think through other"
"01;38;45;14","01;38;47;09","natural ways of using English?"
"01;38;47;09","01;38;49;05","I'm finding that a big challenge myself,"
"01;38;49;05","01;38;50;11","but I think so"
"01;38;50;11","01;38;52;23","as you're laying down those traces,"
"01;38;52;23","01;38;53;22","all you show"
"01;38;53;22","01;38;56;14","in your action policies of how to"
"01;38;57;17","01;38;59;09","record something"
"01;38;59;09","01;39;01;15","rather than your thoughts,"
"01;39;01;15","01;39;03;10","if that makes sense,"
"01;39;03;10","01;39;04;11","and if your thoughts always"
"01;39;04;11","01;39;05;04","slightly hidden."
"01;39;06;19","01;39;08;11","Yeah, great question."
"01;39;08;11","01;39;08;21","Just like"
"01;39;08;21","01;39;09;24","we were thinking about earlier"
"01;39;09;24","01;39;11;05","with a sort of"
"01;39;11;06","01;39;14;17","substrate implicit agnostic ignored"
"01;39;14;17","01;39;16;25","linguistic symbolic models"
"01;39;17;12","01;39;18;14","like a Turing tape."
"01;39;18;14","01;39;19;23","It has infinite space"
"01;39;19;23","01;39;21;14","and it can just make infinite grammar."
"01;39;21;14","01;39;21;26","And so that"
"01;39;21;26","01;39;23;00","sort of purely"
"01;39;23;00","01;39;25;21","symbolic approach to language"
"01;39;25;21","01;39;27;08","and then its relationship to thought"
"01;39;27;08","01;39;29;06","and experience is one question."
"01;39;29;06","01;39;32;02","But when we think about finite actual"
"01;39;32;02","01;39;33;18","sequences of language,"
"01;39;33;18","01;39;36;09","use and deployment as action,"
"01;39;36;14","01;39;38;17","either keyboard typing or assisted"
"01;39;38;28","01;39;40;20","typing technology"
"01;39;40;20","01;39;44;06","or speaking as also a motor action,"
"01;39;44;26","01;39;46;25","it totally changes the game"
"01;39;46;25","01;39;47;09","because we're"
"01;39;47;09","01;39;48;26","not just in this forest"
"01;39;48;26","01;39;51;01","of infinite plausible grammars,"
"01;39;51;01","01;39;54;27","but rather one realized and preferred"
"01;39;55;08","01;39;56;03","action sequence."
"01;39;56;03","01;39;56;28","And then of course,"
"01;39;56;28","01;39;59;00","thoughts are unobserved,"
"01;39;59;00","01;40;00;16","but the actions are not."
"01;40;00;16","01;40;02;09","And that's the whole"
"01;40;02;09","01;40;03;19","quantum reference frame"
"01;40;03;19","01;40;04;06","and share"
"01;40;04;06","01;40;06;23","generative model and rhetorical nature,"
"01;40;06;23","01;40;08;27","narrative nature of cognition."
"01;40;08;27","01;40;12;05","And so indeed the the action insight"
"01;40;12;05","01;40;13;28","I think is going to be something that"
"01;40;13;28","01;40;14;27","we'll keep returning to."
"01;40;16;04","01;40;18;22","We have a final"
"01;40;18;22","01;40;20;24","closing the plane or whatever"
"01;40;21;05","01;40;23;21","and I'll also just"
"01;40;25;10","01;40;27;13","give a little preview,"
"01;40;27;13","01;40;29;22","which is that next week"
"01;40;29;22","01;40;31;01","we're going to be having"
"01;40;31;01","01;40;33;02","a guest stream with Adam."
"01;40;33;02","01;40;35;22","So if it relates at all, Adam,"
"01;40;35;22","01;40;38;06","how does it relate?"
"01;40;38;06","01;40;40;11","What is the guest going to be about?"
"01;40;40;11","01;40;42;27","And then that's in your absence."
"01;40;42;27","01;40;44;09","What would be exciting to discuss"
"01;40;44;09","01;40;51;26","in 42.20,"
"01;40;53;02","01;40;53;12","you're right."
"01;40;53;12","01;40;54;28","There is a stream."
"01;40;54;28","01;40;57;06","A quick thought, though, so I blew."
"01;40;57;07","01;40;58;05","You're suggesting"
"01;40;58;05","01;40;59;21","like Daniel's notes"
"01;40;59;21","01;41;00;05","could serve"
"01;41;00;05","01;41;02;12","almost like a kind of memory palace"
"01;41;02;12","01;41;04;27","and accessible map."
"01;41;05;06","01;41;05;22","And then, Daniel,"
"01;41;05;22","01;41;06;06","you're saying it's"
"01;41;06;06","01;41;08;10","more like a stigma just stick"
"01;41;09;16","01;41;10;26","mechanism for coordination,"
"01;41;10;26","01;41;13;09","like with pointing and cueing."
"01;41;13;09","01;41;16;04","And that's interesting."
"01;41;17;00","01;41;17;28","I wonder if like when people"
"01;41;17;28","01;41;18;26","are reading books,"
"01;41;18;26","01;41;19;18","like the ability"
"01;41;19;18","01;41;21;10","to like use the book instead of like"
"01;41;21;10","01;41;22;23","as a map slash palace"
"01;41;22;23","01;41;23;24","gives it better retention"
"01;41;23;24","01;41;25;14","than something like a Kindle,"
"01;41;25;14","01;41;27;11","like a book is like a physical object."
"01;41;27;11","01;41;29;16","That was so. Yeah,"
"01;41;30;24","01;41;31;14","free will."
"01;41;31;14","01;41;33;22","And so because if your next to me,"
"01;41;33;22","01;41;36;18","I would say that basically"
"01;41;36;18","01;41;38;15","so somebody like over a hypothesis"
"01;41;38;15","01;41;39;23","is that like"
"01;41;39;23","01;41;42;10","all of the details or are there"
"01;41;42;10","01;41;44;10","that many of the details"
"01;41;44;10","01;41;47;01","that Tim is using for these systems"
"01;41;47;06","01;41;50;06","will end up being relevant"
"01;41;50;26","01;41;53;13","as abstract interpretations"
"01;41;53;13","01;41;55;16","of the core"
"01;41;56;17","01;41;58;19","parameters of us as active"
"01;41;58;19","01;42;00;17","inferential cybernetic systems,"
"01;42;00;17","01;42;03;05","both with respect to basically"
"01;42;03;19","01;42;04;16","the basics of let's"
"01;42;04;16","01;42;05;13","just be in the world"
"01;42;05;13","01;42;08;01","and embodied way as far as"
"01;42;09;05","01;42;11;24","living life, living robots, but"
"01;42;12;25","01;42;15;11","also in terms of their extension to"
"01;42;15;11","01;42;16;24","high level cognition,"
"01;42;16;24","01;42;18;09","scaling active inference"
"01;42;18;09","01;42;20;16","to more complex domains."
"01;42;20;16","01;42;22;21","And so like in general, like"
"01;42;22;28","01;42;25;06","I I'm trying to understand"
"01;42;25;18","01;42;27;16","with limited success"
"01;42;27;16","01;42;28;16","with as many details"
"01;42;28;16","01;42;30;13","as I can optimize work"
"01;42;30;13","01;42;31;13","because I think it's"
"01;42;31;13","01;42;32;03","just some of the"
"01;42;32;03","01;42;34;04","most promising sources of"
"01;42;34;04","01;42;34;21","constraints"
"01;42;34;21","01;42;36;04","we have on inference"
"01;42;36;04","01;42;37;12","interpretations and sources"
"01;42;37;12","01;42;38;03","of hypotheses."
"01;42;38;03","01;42;39;21","So basically"
"01;42;39;21","01;42;40;18","whatever details"
"01;42;40;18","01;42;42;01","Jane is willing to get into,"
"01;42;42;01","01;42;43;21","I think you'll be well,"
"01;42;43;21","01;42;45;18","well worth while to try to grok those."
"01;42;45;18","01;42;45;27","And"
"01;42;47;00","01;42;50;00","that's what I'm that's what I'm doing"
"01;42;50;01","01;42;53;22","in terms of next week"
"01;42;53;22","01;42;54;17","so"
"01;42;55;27","01;42;58;07","some of this is relevant and that"
"01;42;58;07","01;43;01;12","the basic idea would be that"
"01;43;01;12","01;43;04;01","these phenomenon, these studies"
"01;43;04;01","01;43;05;01","in which people are seeing"
"01;43;05;01","01;43;06;16","these slowly building"
"01;43;06;16","01;43;08;09","potentials leading up to action"
"01;43;08;09","01;43;10;08","that have predictive information"
"01;43;10;08","01;43;11;24","where they peak"
"01;43;12;14","01;43;14;04","in advance of people claiming"
"01;43;14;04","01;43;16;21","that they have decided to take actions."
"01;43;16;29","01;43;18;12","And where these studies are interpreted"
"01;43;18;12","01;43;20;04","as evidence"
"01;43;20;04","01;43;21;08","that people don't have free will,"
"01;43;21;08","01;43;22;19","we can get into,"
"01;43;22;21","01;43;23;13","you know,"
"01;43;23;13","01;43;26;24","all sorts of conversations about how we"
"01;43;27;07","01;43;28;06","what makes how it makes sense"
"01;43;28;06","01;43;29;21","to think of free will in different ways,"
"01;43;29;21","01;43;32;02","what it makes sense to talk about it all"
"01;43;32;02","01;43;33;24","but that these studies"
"01;43;33;24","01;43;34;18","are usually interpreted"
"01;43;34;18","01;43;37;18","as saying that you're"
"01;43;37;21","01;43;40;02","consciously experienced mental states"
"01;43;40;02","01;43;40;26","cannot enter"
"01;43;40;26","01;43;43;04","causal streams leading to action."
"01;43;43;04","01;43;44;26","And so what I'm suggesting is"
"01;43;44;26","01;43;46;05","that is not the case"
"01;43;46;05","01;43;47;17","and that there's multiple ways"
"01;43;47;17","01;43;48;20","in which"
"01;43;48;20","01;43;49;27","your subjective states"
"01;43;49;27","01;43;51;22","are meaningfully causal."
"01;43;51;22","01;43;53;10","If we think of what's leading up"
"01;43;53;10","01;43;54;02","to something"
"01;43;54;02","01;43;55;06","like deciding"
"01;43;55;06","01;43;56;07","to move your hand"
"01;43;56;07","01;43;58;07","and like an experiment,"
"01;43;58;07","01;44;01;03","if that is reflecting a build up"
"01;44;01;08","01;44;02;04","model evidence"
"01;44;02;04","01;44;03;22","over your proprioceptive pose"
"01;44;03;22","01;44;05;17","or of you deciding to take that action,"
"01;44;07;03","01;44;08;16","this kind of evidence accumulation,"
"01;44;08;16","01;44;09;10","if it's occurring"
"01;44;09;10","01;44;10;05","via sophisticated"
"01;44;10;05","01;44;12;08","and affective inference,"
"01;44;12;15","01;44;13;13","that this would be a way"
"01;44;13;13","01;44;14;27","of understanding it"
"01;44;14;27","01;44;17;17","and that part of it would influence"
"01;44;17;17","01;44;19;18","how much build up or not you get"
"01;44;19;18","01;44;20;27","would be the specifics"
"01;44;20;27","01;44;23;26","of this basically deep research"
"01;44;24;21","01;44;26;06","from sophisticated enough"
"01;44;26;06","01;44;27;11","that we might understand"
"01;44;27;11","01;44;29;08","a sophisticated affective inference"
"01;44;29;08","01;44;31;05","as being orchestrated by the hippocampal"
"01;44;31;05","01;44;32;25","and insurance system"
"01;44;32;25","01;44;34;22","as iterative mental stimulation,"
"01;44;34;22","01;44;35;20","where you're sampling out"
"01;44;35;20","01;44;36;04","these different"
"01;44;36;04","01;44;37;24","possibilities of"
"01;44;37;27","01;44;38;20","what it would be like"
"01;44;38;20","01;44;40;08","if I move my arm or not."
"01;44;40;08","01;44;42;07","And then you're then evaluating that"
"01;44;42;07","01;44;43;25","and your plant, you're peeling off"
"01;44;43;25","01;44;45;24","these different counterfactuals"
"01;44;45;24","01;44;48;24","and that if across these"
"01;44;48;24","01;44;52;04","you get enough"
"01;44;52;04","01;44;54;06","affective charge associated"
"01;44;54;06","01;44;56;02","with going out to these forks,"
"01;44;56;02","01;44;57;01","eventually this results"
"01;44;57;01","01;44;57;29","in threshold crossing."
"01;44;57;29","01;44;59;09","But the idea would be that"
"01;44;59;09","01;45;00;11","so this would be relevant"
"01;45;00;11","01;45;03;02","to some of the hippocampal SAM work"
"01;45;03;13","01;45;05;14","and that you can think of this"
"01;45;06;02","01;45;08;05","imaginative planning stage"
"01;45;08;13","01;45;10;08","leading up to even seemingly"
"01;45;10;08","01;45;11;26","spontaneous actions."
"01;45;11;26","01;45;12;14","You can think of this"
"01;45;12;14","01;45;13;07","imaginative face"
"01;45;13;07","01;45;15;23","as being largely orchestrated"
"01;45;15;23","01;45;17;20","by the hippocampal system,"
"01;45;17;20","01;45;19;22","which might be best understood as a"
"01;45;20;01","01;45;21;28","general system for"
"01;45;22;27","01;45;23;14","or a system"
"01;45;23;14","01;45;26;26","for generalized foraging and mapping"
"01;45;27;08","01;45;28;07","so nothing made sense,"
"01;45;28;07","01;45;30;03","but that's like some of the connections."
"01;45;30;03","01;45;30;16","Well,"
"01;45;30;16","01;45;31;16","if you still want to come through"
"01;45;31;16","01;45;33;20","the gas stream, you're welcome to do so."
"01;45;34;04","01;45;35;08","I know that."
"01;45;35;08","01;45;36;20","Thanks for the awesome summary"
"01;45;36;20","01;45;37;07","and I know that"
"01;45;37;07","01;45;38;10","we'll be able to unpack it"
"01;45;38;10","01;45;42;09","a lot more next week on Blue or Stephen."
"01;45;42;09","01;45;43;28","What are some like last thoughts?"
"01;45;43;28","01;45;45;26","What was exciting"
"01;45;45;26","01;45;47;14","or interesting to you in Where"
"01;45;47;14","01;45;48;04","We've Been"
"01;45;48;04","01;45;50;05","and Where Shall We Forage next"
"01;45;52;21","01;45;53;26","so I Can Go?"
"01;45;53;26","01;45;55;27","I was really interested"
"01;45;55;27","01;45;57;05","in taking this into"
"01;45;57;05","01;45;58;01","semantic space,"
"01;45;58;01","01;45;59;03","and I wonder what"
"01;45;59;03","01;46;01;10","other kind of spaces that we can maybe"
"01;46;01;27","01;46;04;00","think about mapping out"
"01;46;04;00","01;46;06;04","how we build, how we construct maps,"
"01;46;06;04","01;46;07;21","cognitive space and so forth."
"01;46;07;21","01;46;10;00","And I'm excited to talk to him"
"01;46;10;00","01;46;10;26","about where"
"01;46;10;26","01;46;12;25","we're emergence fits into that"
"01;46;12;25","01;46;14;01","hierarchical model."
"01;46;15;17","01;46;16;02","Awesome."
"01;46;16;02","01;46;18;10","Thank you. Blue Stephen."
"01;46;18;16","01;46;20;25","Yeah, I think keeping the"
"01;46;20;25","01;46;23;09","the idea of keeping things clean,"
"01;46;23;10","01;46;25;00","keeping things nice and,"
"01;46;25;00","01;46;27;24","and deflate re it even in this case"
"01;46;27;24","01;46;29;11","here is really something"
"01;46;29;11","01;46;31;10","I think to continue looking at."
"01;46;31;10","01;46;32;05","And I"
"01;46;32;08","01;46;33;06","I'm really curious"
"01;46;33;06","01;46;35;16","about what happens when we see that door"
"01;46;36;13","01;46;37;17","and that door says"
"01;46;37;17","01;46;39;16","you can go down that corridor."
"01;46;39;16","01;46;42;19","Am I going to go down into a different"
"01;46;42;19","01;46;43;23","regime of attention?"
"01;46;43;23","01;46;44;24","I'm going to stay where I am."
"01;46;44;24","01;46;48;00","So I think that that ability"
"01;46;48;00","01;46;51;17","to take these principles"
"01;46;52;05","01;46;52;28","and say, OK,"
"01;46;52;28","01;46;53;29","what is it that happens"
"01;46;53;29","01;46;56;03","when I encounter something"
"01;46;56;03","01;46;58;03","and it triggers something,"
"01;46;58;03","01;47;00;05","how much is that"
"01;47;00;05","01;47;01;15","significant in terms"
"01;47;01;15","01;47;02;16","of making things happen?"
"01;47;02;16","01;47;05;21","And I'm curious then how that can marry"
"01;47;05;21","01;47;08;06","with a lot of the mental space work"
"01;47;08;06","01;47;09;15","that I do, building out"
"01;47;09;15","01;47;10;23","metaphor landscapes"
"01;47;10;23","01;47;14;13","or actually letting someone explore"
"01;47;14;24","01;47;16;06","spatially."
"01;47;16;06","01;47;17;15","And one last thing"
"01;47;17;15","01;47;18;10","actually that came up,"
"01;47;18;10","01;47;19;04","someone said to me"
"01;47;19;04","01;47;20;16","the other day is"
"01;47;20;16","01;47;21;23","there's really curious why"
"01;47;21;23","01;47;23;15","when he picks up his plastic pencil,"
"01;47;23;15","01;47;25;18","it doesn't mean as much to him"
"01;47;25;18","01;47;27;28","as when he holds a shell."
"01;47;27;28","01;47;28;19","So there's something about"
"01;47;28;19","01;47;32;27","like when that door has got some prior"
"01;47;32;27","01;47;33;29","there's something that you know"
"01;47;33;29","01;47;36;05","about being in the woodland"
"01;47;36;05","01;47;38;08","versus being somewhere which is dead."
"01;47;38;28","01;47;40;11","And even that itself"
"01;47;40;11","01;47;41;25","could explain a lot about"
"01;47;42;24","01;47;43;26","how navigating"
"01;47;43;26","01;47;46;09","those places, the eco psychology of"
"01;47;46;28","01;47;48;14","going into a wooded space,"
"01;47;48;14","01;47;50;02","a living place"
"01;47;50;02","01;47;54;04","actually can be important for people."
"01;47;54;22","01;47;55;07","Just seeing that"
"01;47;55;07","01;47;56;00","in a wellness,"
"01;47;56;00","01;47;58;29","what might seem a very woo woo"
"01;47;58;29","01;48;00;28","type of stuff actually"
"01;48;00;28","01;48;02;07","could be somehow linked"
"01;48;02;07","01;48;03;13","to what we're talking about here."
"01;48;03;13","01;48;06;02","So we have brilliant things"
"01;48;06;21","01;48;07;28","awesome. Yeah."
"01;48;07;28","01;48;10;29","Very exciting and fun"
"01;48;11;20","01;48;12;26","discussion."
"01;48;13;29","01;48;16;03","I really like that last piece, which is"
"01;48;16;03","01;48;16;11","I know"
"01;48;16;11","01;48;17;11","I'm going to"
"01;48;17;14","01;48;18;04","carry forward"
"01;48;18;04","01;48;20;23","and hopefully reflect on next week."
"01;48;21;16","01;48;23;22","How will we build that colony?"
"01;48;24;14","01;48;26;05","Is it a memory palace?"
"01;48;26;05","01;48;27;17","Blueprint,"
"01;48;27;24","01;48;28;22","is it stigma,"
"01;48;28;22","01;48;30;23","logic, coordination, but how?"
"01;48;32;00","01;48;34;27","And so somewhere between the"
"01;48;34;27","01;48;37;13","mental Alice Cathedral"
"01;48;37;29","01;48;39;26","and the sort of picking up pebbles"
"01;48;39;26","01;48;41;21","and having no bigger picture"
"01;48;41;21","01;48;43;14","is where we are"
"01;48;43;14","01;48;45;28","in our cognitive and social maps."
"01;48;45;28","01;48;46;13","And so"
"01;48;47;22","01;48;49;00","that's quite an area."
"01;48;49;00","01;48;51;24","And out of the central complex modeling,"
"01;48;52;01","01;48;53;07","I can't wait."
"01;48;53;19","01;48;55;24","So thank you all for joining."
"01;48;55;24","01;48;56;08","Thanks, Tim."
"01;48;56;08","01;48;58;12","Also, so Adam, Stephen and Blue"
"01;48;58;16","01;49;00;06","and Syd and Dean in the chat."
"01;49;00;06","01;49;01;11","So thanks everybody"
"01;49;01;11","01;49;02;06","and see you next time."
