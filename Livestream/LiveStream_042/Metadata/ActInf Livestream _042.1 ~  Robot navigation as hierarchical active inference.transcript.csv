"Speaker 1","00;00;00;02","00;00;35;08","Some questions that we had from the zero. But also new questions arising. So we'll just start with an introduction and saying hello and then it will be awesome to hear the authors initial contextualization. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California. And as explored a little bit in the dot zero with Sid, there's a few places that we were super curious about, ranging from how does one go from a phenomena that they want to model, like navigation to the analytical equations, and how is that related to active inference and the free energy principle?"
"Speaker 1","00;00;35;08","00;00;47;12","And then how do we go from that analytical formulation? To the actual gigabyte of video data and the real time sensing in action. So a lot of exciting topics and all paths to blue."
"Speaker 2","00;00;49;12","00;01;14;23","I am blue. I'm a researcher in New Mexico, and this paper was kind of way over my head for a lot of reasons. It's just so far out of what I normally do but I have some questions related to the hierarchical modeling and how that is kind of used and how that can be related or cannot be related to maybe biological systems that model in a hierarchical way."
"Speaker 2","00;01;14;23","00;01;22;04","Similarly, and I'll pass it off to Adam I guess if you want to start or introduce yourself then and you guys can take it away."
"Speaker 3","00;01;24;12","00;01;59;15","Hi, I'm Adam. I'm a systems neuroscientist who's currently a research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelics and Consciousness Research I've been collaborating with Tim and Ozone and others on trying to understand the nature of navigation and nature and the ways in which the hippocampal and end to renal system might be relevant and the ways in which this could be used as a means of understanding thought more generally."
"Speaker 3","00;02;00;11","00;02;08;15","And it's been awesome and slightly intimidating, except Tim is awesome. So that's made it less intimidating."
"Speaker 3","00;02;13;08","00;02;53;05","The lab brings it to me. Scientists and their computer scientists roboticists have gone to university and we haven't subscribed to the active inference formalism to try to make the selection more intelligent. But this paper. Well, I think one of our major accomplishments last year recently deliberation with the Edinburgh based, we look at the problem from navigation, from from different angles ranging from active inference modeling to an actual implementation on a real robot."
"Speaker 3","00;02;54;07","00;03;31;14","And at the same time looking at how could this work in an actual brain or model relations and the synergies there. So it's really exciting to get this paper out. But also this was just getting started. I'd say that it was basically our first artifact that we published. We had another run together with Adam in the works and yeah, I'm pretty sure that we will continue this endeavor for quite some time longer."
"Speaker 3","00;03;31;17","00;03;50;00","So we're all just only just getting started. So that being said, probably a lot of the questions are also still questions for us there to see what extent we can give an answer. As of today, already awesome. Well."
"Speaker 1","00;03;50;08","00;04;19;00","We can start with this sort of triad that is highlighted in the paper and Adam, you said it as understanding the basis of navigation. And we have these three legs to the stool, kind of three threads that intertwine in the paper with it analytical formulation of navigation, which is what Blue mentioned with a hierarchical generative model and the implementation in robotic and in biological systems."
"Speaker 1","00;04;19;07","00;04;34;12","So maybe a first question is how has this intersection of modeling navigation with robotics and biology been conceptualized? And what brought you to apply active inference in this way? And what does it add."
"Speaker 3","00;04;45;03","00;05;32;22","You should go first though. So maybe my perspective here is that we basically got started from from a robotics perspective, like looking at the navigation problem and looking at the the ways that it's being solved right now and implemented right now. And at the same time, we already have quite some experience with active inference, but more like, oh, yeah, simpler problems, let's say, or first or first experiments or more on these kind of mountain core environments or smooth core research."
"Speaker 3","00;05;33;05","00;06;10;17","But it will always our goal to kind of drive skills up through the real world robots. And so we got started by drawing and seeing parallels between current civilizations out there. And that seemed to match with how we would look at it from an active inference perspective and kind of work our way from both ways. So on the one hand, try to get some implementation running and on the other hand, seeing how we could formalize it and actually made the math work."
"Speaker 3","00;06;10;28","00;06;44;00","In the case of inference framework. And what we found out was that actually the best matching implementation from a robotics perspective was actually one that was quite bio inspired. So it was basically the lab model from Seattle where they had these heavy inspiration from grid cells, these cells and these things. And of course, it was not really a surprise given the fact how active inference is also grounded in neuroscience."
"Speaker 3","00;06;44;15","00;07;19;25","And so that's where we reached out to to them to basically show off like a big this is our trajectory, this is our plan, this is our current implementation. Then how do you think the math could work and then, Adam, with this infinite knowledge of how the this could work in the range of like all kind of forms was like, okay, but this is interesting because what you implemented here is actually a lot for local like this kind of system."
"Speaker 3","00;07;19;25","00;07;52;13","And what you're doing here is actually very much like these kind of things. And then we just set up let's begin this further and we basically stole this on curving out becoming like, OK, if this is how it's done in the brain, then maybe we can make something more similar in the models or in the implementation and vice versa and the was basically the first step where we had like the three bits kind of in place."
"Speaker 3","00;07;52;13","00;08;08;23","But we know where the open issues are, but it actually had something working and sensible on all three levels, I'd say. And that's, that's the very me we are at at this moment."
"Speaker 1","00;08;11;26","00;08;14;16","Awesome. Thank you, Adam. Anything you add."
"Speaker 3","00;08;14;23","00;09;11;04","To that well, I guess what I would add is an increasingly compelled by the idea that robotics as a touchstone and basis for understanding different aspects of mind is like it might be the most powerful kind of grounded empiricism we can do. And I think it's both because it's like a lot of times, like that Feynman quote of like, what I can cannot build I cannot understand is like mentioned, but this is actually building systems that this is that have to work and and that these problems like in going through them and looking at the different solutions like the kind of understanding you get I think is really unique but also I think it's particularly"
"Speaker 3","00;09;11;04","00;10;00;00","apps because of what our minds other than control cybernetic control systems for bodies that have to move through the world. And so this idea that like the way roboticists are approaching it like it's and that is the exact problem that nature had to solve but natural selection has a self and now the question is was it the same it might be in some cases as you'd expect within the bounds of nature to be a fairly clever blind designer in terms of what you might discover and so just this going back and forth between the the robotics perspective and how it might work in biology and then this abstract ways that there are the, the abstract"
"Speaker 3","00;10;00;00","00;10;18;11","algorithmic implementations of them for the robots and seeing how those can mutually inform each other. It's that for me, it's a this is how I basically want all my thinking about the mind to be formalized. Like, I feel like this is just like this is how it is that this is the most powerful way of thinking on it."
"Speaker 3","00;10;19;03","00;10;20;00","That back and forth."
"Speaker 1","00;10;26;00","00;10;49;16","Let's entering the biological door or blue, do you have a question? OK, so Adam, what even though of course it's a deep area and there's writing in the paper and citations and so on, what is so interesting about the structuring of the grid cells through space and time and what can we learn from that about effective ways of navigating."
"Speaker 3","00;11;07;04","00;11;35;24","So in in latent slam we have these pose cells and actually I think probably better for him to talk about that, like the exact ways in which these cells function within the robotic system. I think that actually brings more clarity than the more mysterious like so there's lots of ideas been going around like computational neuroscience stuff like what the brain cells might do."
"Speaker 3","00;11;36;09","00;12;09;10","But I actually think the greatest clarity comes from like, well, how would the analogs work in the robotic system? So kick that's a term what do you think to yeah. So I think that's in implementation. The the parallel with grid. So that's kind of on hardwired in the patient. So this by design, you have something that looks if you squint your eyes a lot, it looks a bit like grooves."
"Speaker 3","00;12;09;10","00;12;51;20","So I wouldn't say that we actually have grid cells in here because to me the group sort of basically it should be an abstract, it should be giving you a way of modeling movement in an abstract space basically. And in the case of navigation, the space by accident maps to the real world and the grid cell activation is just the the grid, an array of encoding where you are in space without without just giving you the x y coordinates."
"Speaker 3","00;12;51;20","00;13;22;15","Basically, there's a more kind of higher dimensional, more robust representation of where are you on this on the grid and how do you define our move how those how does your location in in this reference frame or does this change as we know in our representation, we basically just said we know that we are in the roughly flat surface world."
"Speaker 3","00;13;23;02","00;13;56;20","So the main coordinates that we need to correct and integrate over are the x, x, y position and the head direction. These are basically the main things. And we use this thing called the continuous director network to kind of represent this street coordinates. And we basically inject knowledge that if you move forward, then you will also move forward."
"Speaker 3","00;13;56;28","00;14;39;00","In this, the director network location and roughly this, this corresponds to doing kind of false integration. And I'm pretty sure the grid cells are giving you similar functionality in the brain that I would not say that our current implementation actually has good rules. I think the parallel is more with these cells because there we do have kind of we do learn representations from visual sensory inputs that kind of give you an and this is the middle, this is a particular location."
"Speaker 3","00;14;39;14","00;15;05;21","And if you see a similar or better than it is likely that you are visiting the same location again. And if at the same time you happen to have a very similar X, y and head direction as in your as in your previous time, you, you saw something similar, then you're pretty good evidence that you are actually in the same spot."
"Speaker 3","00;15;06;00","00;15;23;11","And then this is what you then go loop closure and then you kind of reorient yourself as if you were at the same location. So that's kind of how I would think of cells and body cells in North Korea."
"Speaker 1","00;15;23;11","00;15;31;12","Current thank you. Blue, do you have any questions? Yes, please go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;15;32;15","00;16;00;19","So I'm curious as to the role, if any, or how the system may change if you included propria reception, which is like the sense of where your body is in space. And so like this is partially modeled through the visual system at play cells, grid cells, et cetera. But it's it's not always right. So it includes other senses like balance and where's my hand and these kinds of things."
"Speaker 2","00;16;01;06","00;16;14;29","And I'm just curious if your model includes that in any way or only or not or how it may change if it did give it give it kind of like a more embodied yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;16;14;29","00;16;50;24","So so basically in our case, the reception is limited to basically the the velocity commands that you that you issued to the to the robot. It also observes these again, so it assumes that it knows which command sending and then these are also going to be fed back through the model as kind of a sensor. So if you say drive forward or turn left or turn right with this kind of anger of all this, this information is also sent into the model and this is then what we call the action."
"Speaker 3","00;16;50;24","00;17;26;21","So I remember in the especially in the low level mobile injection for this is basically you can you can see this as kind of a pro-U.S. thing. And so everything kind of predicts what will happen given given what I, I sense that I was doing basically and we do it both for the for the visual sensor, like what's what I see if I if I'm turning left or right to go forward, but also for tracking the force and doing the integration."
"Speaker 3","00;17;26;21","00;17;38;17","Like if I move forward and my heading was zero angle, then I will probably just move forward to the X direction of the, of the, of the became."
"Speaker 1","00;17;42;06","00;18;13;08","And that introduction of counterfactuals and anticipation. What would happen if I did this is very interesting area. And also it speaks to the Campos ability and the flexibility of the active inference model. Like I said, highlighted that only the visual data were being used here with RG B values of video. But there are other kinds of sensors that could be used as another sense state and that would kind of increase the dimensionality of the model."
"Speaker 1","00;18;13;13","00;18;57;09","Maybe it is a value add, maybe it's not, but it doesn't require RI writing. It's like more like plugging in a different hard drive than it is like having a different computer. So you mentioned a higher dimensional robust representation of location, and that's definitely one of the advantages and and aspects of the model that'll be important to explore more like in the dot zero, we explored this paper, are we ready for service robots that showed how sometimes even trivial changes to environments can result in the robot getting lost because it has reference to something like a chair that's no longer at the same location."
"Speaker 1","00;18;57;25","00;19;35;01","So how does this model provide a higher dimensional, robust representation of location and how did you go from thinking about that to the actual way that the generative model is framed? That's the first question. And then the second part is going to be about how do you go from the framing to the actual computational implementation, but just the first stage of this pipeline, how do we go from wishing upon a star that we could have biologically inspired resilient navigation to writing down the formalisms as you had them."
"Speaker 3","00;19;38;07","00;20;20;17","And so to get back at your your first the problems that you that you mentioned on the on the service robot like. So basically the major problem in robotics slam is that indeed if your environment changes like your bits, then then the same location doesn't look the same anymore in whatever sensor modality you're using. And that can be problematic, especially if you if you want to model the environment as like the metric system where you basically define this is my origin."
"Speaker 3","00;20;20;17","00;21;07;15","So this is see where zero in the grid system. And now I will for every obstacle or thing that I approach I really lost my estimation of the x y coordinates. And then suddenly when your chair moves, of course everything breaks here. And in this system we actually get rid of being grounded in the metric space the only thing that matters is that this location looks very similar to something I visited before and it also seems likely, given the the integrated trajectory I assumed I was following."
"Speaker 3","00;21;07;24","00;21;39;18","So this might be the same spot. And if you think that or if the chair moves in the place that that's fine, then you just say, OK, maybe it's a different spot. It doesn't really matter at some points you will have kind of a cue that is stable, right? So and that's actually what we also do as humans, if you want to navigate, you just look for the cues that you are that you know, that are pretty stable."
"Speaker 3","00;21;39;18","00;22;14;19","If you visit a new town, you will look for church tower because you know it will not move. You will not orient yourself based on the color of the cars that are forth somewhere. So I think by by using the active inference principle as a starting point, you can you can get rid of all a lot of these these problems because your agents will automatically look for disabled cues and if suddenly the environment changes."
"Speaker 3","00;22;14;19","00;22;47;13","But just accept this and just model it as like, OK, I, I think I'm revisiting this same trajectory, but now it looks different. So maybe I just have to model such as this is kind of the trajectory. This can change often and maybe this implies that if you plan the next time you do, I would prefer a different trajectory where you know that everything is stable so this is the, the same as reducing your ambiguity."
"Speaker 3","00;22;47;27","00;23;19;03","So I think that getting rid of everything from this structure in this X Y location, in the metric space and else I don't know what's going on just by getting rid of that and and just assume anything can happen, anything can change. And if it does not change, I prefer I like it better. This helps a lot to circumvent a lot of the traditional problems of the Foo."
"Speaker 1","00;23;19;17","00;23;21;16","Adam, anything to add on that."
"Speaker 3","00;23;24;00","00;24;02;27","I mean, so one of the things that we've been working on is so like in this paper, it's like trying to say, OK, OK, so to what degree are the principles of what we understand about like the natures of like hippocampal enteritis system being reflected in this simultaneous localization and mapping problem and latency and some of the other work that we're doing is also going the reverse direction of what, you know, what can these principles of these same principles use for autonomous navigation."
"Speaker 3","00;24;03;13","00;24;33;12","What can you tell us about the brain functioning as a cybernetic system? And so one idea in general is that each of these operations, in addition to having this fundamental significance of the of the basics of being able to move through the world is, you know, tasks and any active inferential system that's going to survive and repeat and do what it needs to do has to handle."
"Speaker 3","00;24;33;12","00;25;19;04","But to what extent were these same principles repurposed for sophisticated inference more generally? And there are actual and to what degree is sophisticated inference structured according to some principles. And so, so if you talk about things like loop closure or events like this one in this highly familiar state and where you think you know where you are by this convergence of like your trajectory information and your pose, this question would be like, is this a model potentially for the feeling of insight or discovering of like causal accounts?"
"Speaker 3","00;25;20;11","00;25;33;09","Is this and is this actually a inter an intra individual source of internal individual differences, which would be fairly fundamental, like how familiar do you think things are or not?"
"Speaker 3","00;25;36;04","00;26;13;29","How much do you update on a county or any country in these highly familiar situations? And so like so for me personally, what I've been wondering is, OK, so to what extent like of all the details, so to what degree so re representing the biological details in terms of the kinds of descriptions that Tim is giving here and also the thinking of cognition more generally as navigation and so thinking of like each of these things, what are the analogs at the level of thought as a kind of navigation through generalized space wow."
"Speaker 3","00;26;14;19","00;26;16;13","Awesome map and navigation."
"Speaker 1","00;26;17;22","00;26;33;13","A lot of interesting work on exploration, exploitation in mind and space hills at all 20, 15 and on thinking about planning and the evolution of planning as being related to spatial as well as cognitive foraging split."
"Speaker 2","00;26;36;00","00;27;07;19","So it's interesting to think about cognition as navigation. Like I think about the feeling that I have when I'm like searching for a thought, a word, a name of a person. Like it literally feels like a like you're scrolling through a filing cabinet, like physically looking for this like piece of information in your brain. And I know that like different neurons, like store different pieces of information like the Jennifer Aniston neuron and, and these kinds of things."
"Speaker 2","00;27;08;06","00;27;21;07","So I wonder what can you just elaborate maybe a little bit more on that, Adam, about cognition as navigation, is it like literally navigating to find the right like neuron that goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding? That's the one I wanted."
"Speaker 3","00;27;22;21","00;28;00;08","For like to subject to it could be. And that like so too is it might think of this one like you were talking before and you really bring up like memory palaces and I think that would be like one example of thought navigation, navigation, which is like with this like art of memory in terms of like it can be like part of the way we access and organize the information we work with when we're thinking is through a kind of spatial zation of and actually like to the extent that we show like really great virtuosity with memory, it's through an explicit process of space analyzing and navigating through domain."
"Speaker 3","00;28;00;24","00;28;38;04","And that gives us like the best purchase we have on, you know, remembering these building constructions and accessing these complex structures. But in terms of like what you're describing is like something kind of like Jennifer Anderson or like neurons are like to kind of finding the things come to mind. There's like foraging theory. And so what you might be foraging for like when you're like looking for like something that fits is a certain amount of like familiarity or like some amount of like it could take different forms like, you know, some sort of."
"Speaker 3","00;28;38;24","00;29;01;24","Yeah, maybe, maybe it's anti receptive code. It's like, like a visceral feeling of like comparing this or maybe it's like a more appropriate set of code and like tension in the body. I don't know what it might be, but like there's some sort of read you're having and are you finding what you're looking for and suddenly there'd be like, you're foraging for it."
"Speaker 3","00;29;01;24","00;29;19;24","And so you might spend a little bit of time in some area of conceptual space and you're kind of moving around in there, like trying out different permutations. And then like now I'm not finding it. And then you might do like a different tech and then move to another area of semantic or conceptual space and you're searching around there."
"Speaker 3","00;29;19;24","00;29;40;21","And so like and foraging theory, these we call them, I believe luvvie flights. And so there's like a something called the Marginal Value Theorem, which is like if you're trying to be an optimal forager you're trying to balance exploration and exploitation. And so you don't want to spend too long in a given like patch if it's not having what you want."
"Speaker 3","00;29;40;29","00;30;08;10","But you don't want to leave a patch prematurely if it's a good patch to be exploited. And so the idea is like if you're looking for like searching for a name or something that fits it might take the form of this kind of like generalized foraging. But instead of you like locomote in three spaces, you're actually spending different amounts of time in semantic spaces and then shifting based on whether you think you're actually it's like a juicy patch."
"Speaker 3","00;30;09;05","00;30;50;16","And so like the marginal value differences like if your current rate of foraging drops below the historical return, then you should, then you should go. And so this like there might be different like inductive biases in the brain that would represent this like from a campus system. This might look like for instance, like the way by cloud is like you might get like this pretty dictionary air drops below a certain amount or goes past a certain amount and then hippocampal system like ramps up with a lot of recurrent activity is called like a ripple and then it resets itself and like retail space and like stimulates cortex and like a new like set of operative"
"Speaker 3","00;30;50;24","00;31;15;08","policies and spatial relations might occur. And so like this would be like an example of like a mechanism like hippocampus is going to have like a built in mechanism for like these like attentional shift and shifts in these imagine of shifts when you're doing foraging, it might be reflected also like other ways, like a dopamine. So there's like some thoughts on like Nathaniel, let's talk about like one way of interpreting opponent C between like physic and tonic."
"Speaker 3","00;31;15;08","00;31;38;18","Dopamine would be like the tonic would tell you like what's your average return? Basically and there seems to be like a kind of functional alt. It's not antagonism, but like the more your tonic is high, the more you're the less impactful any face like event is. And so it would be kind of like if you're foraging, like what would occasion a shift or not?"
"Speaker 3","00;31;39;17","00;32;02;04","You might actually see this like playing out like in the way neuro modulators work. And so I don't know if I like helps a lot, but the idea is like this is the sort of like thinking in terms of foraging or navigation to generalized spaces as basically being so the reason like, you know, so I guess there's like a kind of like apriori reason."
"Speaker 3","00;32;02;04","00;32;21;23","Like you would expect it to be generally good, which is doesn't everything like in most of the things you encounter do indeed exist in spaces? And then most things, the way we understand them is by like specializing them, it's like we grow them. We, we do like multidimensional scale and we do different things to try to like it's just like a way we understand things."
"Speaker 3","00;32;22;11","00;32;59;23","But it also seems like this was probably both evolutionarily and developmentally like this was the original challenge that had to be solved where the systems were paying their weight and that this would then involve like a repurposing and or redeploying for more abstract domains. So like there's some other like I think it's Burgess has done some good work like finding like for instance, like we might create like amorphous space and we're like looking like, like they'll create like these generative like birds with like different like neck lengths and you're trying to do like categories over like what the different kinds of birds are."
"Speaker 3","00;33;00;09","00;33;24;28","And there's, there's evidence that like the way we do the categorization is we'll create a, a specialization of this task structure and there's some others that have a couple system is we're navigating through that and dealing with these categories. And so that's that was a lot of rambling. But like, I don't know if that got to any of that land or."
"Speaker 2","00;33;25;04","00;33;27;11","Yeah, lots of it land. It is very cool. Thank you."
"Speaker 3","00;33;27;14","00;33;27;24","OK."
"Speaker 1","00;33;29;16","00;34;06;17","One note that will I'm sure, be exploring going forward. Optimal foraging theory is often put in the context of utility, which is just the pragmatic components in active inference in terms of policy selection. So optimal active inference foraging is like when the epistemic and the pragmatic gain are being considered. So that's quite interesting. And then also there's as you brought up individual and collective navigation and so one case is sort of the sovereign robot, no Wi-Fi onboard computation alone in the warehouse."
"Speaker 1","00;34;07;03","00;34;37;29","But then in the case of, for example, an ant colony where there's stigma and modification of the environment that might be possible or even facilitated by different onboard cognition and different outsourced or offloaded, which brings us to extended cognitive discussions. But let's return to this question about going from this resiliency of navigation that a biologist knows exist. A roboticist might want to see."
"Speaker 1","00;34;38;18","00;34;59;27","How did you then go to that third space and actually have a hierarchical model so here in figure two or wherever else, you suggest what is happening here? And how did this graphical structure come to be as opposed to potentially like other graphical structures that could have been used."
"Speaker 3","00;35;03;16","00;35;46;14","So basically let me first maybe explain all the variables in this in this figure. So going from the bottom to up at the bottom, we have the both of these which are basically observations. So these are like the visual inputs that what the robot thinks is and then we have to leave them variables s and P. S is basically an estimation of all the different factors that give rise to the observation."
"Speaker 3","00;35;46;14","00;36;17;25","So this is it's kind of a belief in space that the film finds all possible visual observations. And B, on the other hand, is the leading variable that's has a representation of, of your force, which is then basically in this case your your ex wife position and direction and there we go, we have one more, which is the need action."
"Speaker 3","00;36;18;12","00;36;55;04","And so that's what I hinted at previously. This is basically your, your proprioception, you know, you know, what you have been doing. So there, there for up until the past the eighties are also shaded. So it means that you basically have access to what you have been doing. It's like the low level action, like move forward to this philosophy, alternate for life, but then for the future this becomes an observer thing and you basically want to infer potential actions you should be doing in the future."
"Speaker 3","00;36;56;27","00;37;22;23","And then for the future, the number of actions can be just summarized spy, which is then the policy. So the policy is no more than the sequence of future actions that you that you that you want to do, that you intend to do, and then you move up the level in the hierarchy and there and through more variables."
"Speaker 3","00;37;22;23","00;38;00;17","One is the location. Oh, and this is then basically kind of a more green yeah. Look, representation of location, where am I? But it's not really it's not necessarily sides to a metric space. It's just like identify this is a location. And then we have also an action space at this level. But this is the more we call this moves or M and the move is basically kind of moving from one location to another."
"Speaker 3","00;38;00;26","00;38;29;23","So locations can just be more coarse grains like what you what you define as like a separate location in your environment. Whereas at the lower level, the states, if you move from one states to the other, it's basically just saying, OK, what would be the next frame of my camera sensor, if you like? And so it's also crucial to know that these two levels operate on different kind of time scales."
"Speaker 3","00;38;30;04","00;39;02;08","So the lowest level time scale is basically your very fine, fine grained action perception loop. I, I send the motor commands through the robots and I resolve my camera and this can go through. I think we implemented that like ten versus ten times per second the newcomer frames updated the motor command, various locations just like and moving from one location to another again can take you maybe ten or more times."
"Speaker 3","00;39;02;08","00;39;35;15","That's at the lower level. And then of course one of the crucial bits is then when when do you how do you then how do you identify a location? And so basically how it comes to be is that if you you you basically observe your right your space through the camera images, we can infer this abstract states space and then we look at some what what is the surprise of being in the states versus what they predicted."
"Speaker 3","00;39;35;28","00;40;20;25","And if this supports is like a certain threshold. So yeah, it's a pretty complex move to to explain, but I'll do my best. So every time everything's step you get basically a new camera image and you can go too late like what is what is the divergence between what I was thinking about the state previously and how does that how did that shift with my new observation is that of the Bayesian surprise that you have from studying this observation and everything that we accumulate like this number and once we follow a certain threshold, which is kind of hard for me to read just speaks of the something that seems to work if you suppose this"
"Speaker 3","00;40;20;25","00;41;07;21","threshold to basically say, OK, this is now this thing to know and timestamp before so it must be something new, it must be a new kind of location in my neck. And then you add this thing as this thing, this thing to location then your map and you add like the link from the previous location to this one and you start and then you continue further on building the map and this is how you then kind of create this more course grain map of your environment and, and you can then reason like how should I move from this location to another and you then can, you can then basically use your, your previous you visit"
"Speaker 3","00;41;07;21","00;41;34;27","locations and moves together. I have a model of how can I move in this space, but at the more great level, moving from one location to another. And it also means that by by using this surprise on the first meeting space that we infer from from visual input, it means that it's not not every edge has the same distance in real space."
"Speaker 3","00;41;35;02","00;42;00;23","So so if you're if the robot is reversing a white hallway where the walls are perfectly white and everything that everything's the same, then it will take a long time for this special to be reached. And it will only have larger distances. Make a new node because everything looks the same anyway. So there's no extra information that I need to put in the map."
"Speaker 3","00;42;01;08","00;42;43;22","But if you then suddenly see a door, for example, then you're suddenly reach your threshold, then you add a new location in your map. So it's basically the locations in the map or basically the final on what is the information I got by looking at this thing rather than how much meters that I traverse in this in this thing and this makes it a really interesting way of representing maps because it's more like how much information is there in this particular location rather than which x y look position?"
"Speaker 3","00;42;43;22","00;42;51;16","Is this your does does it make sense yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;42;52;04","00;43;21;06","And it feels to map onto the distinction between like Chronos and Kairos, like in this analogy, here, Chronos is the chronometer, it's the watch time, it's the geometry, it's the x y grid, it's one meter. And then Kairos is like the timeliness of action in the time it takes to complete an action. And then something being like boring that's going through a low information hallway in the cognitive foraging."
"Speaker 1","00;43;21;06","00;43;52;12","It's like, are we there yet? Driving through this featureless landscape where the salience is low because my predictions are basically being met almost too well, and there's a lot of other ways to go with it. Adam, anything to add? And also, again, I'm just kind of curious, like, what is the space of the possible graphical structures? Do you think that this is the only or the sort of grandfather graphical model for hierarchical navigation?"
"Speaker 1","00;43;52;12","00;44;04;00","Like how do we go from imagining this tactics and strategy, multilevel model to a graphical model that we believe will be consistent with active inference and amenable to message passing."
"Speaker 3","00;44;06;11","00;44;36;26","And maybe to act on this last question, I think Kristen has the as a paper on some role models where he basically lays out more generic. So like if you're looking at the ultimate generic hierarchical model, you'll find it. There is basically just an aggregation of states that give rise to observations that go from one state to another given the action."
"Speaker 3","00;44;37;09","00;45;06;25","And then you can add the level of doctor you can keep on adding levels. And that's kind of the prototypical article model, I would say. And what we see here, this kind of particular instantiation where we took some domain knowledge like OK, from every nation, what would be sensible levels to think about and what would these latent things then what should they represent?"
"Speaker 3","00;45;07;08","00;45;37;05","And then of course around the end of like, OK, at the lowest level, I need to have some state that represents my images. And at the higher level, I want to have some locations in the map and how do they then relate? OK, I probably also want this, this, this false integration. So maybe I need to have a special first couple citizens here in the form of my folks."
"Speaker 3","00;45;37;27","00;46;04;14","And that's how you basically build up the model from first we have this was difficult to model then looking at. Yeah, but in my case, what do I think is sensible? What could these things mean and then try to figure out like, OK, at this at this stage we kind of converge on the one hand from top down, like does the math work out through bottom up?"
"Speaker 3","00;46;04;14","00;46;10;14","Does this match match with my implementation? And then at some point we converge to do this basically."
"Speaker 1","00;46;12;07","00;46;16;06","So the high road and the low road, they do lead to Rome after all."
"Speaker 3","00;46;17;09","00;46;17;22","Exactly."
"Speaker 1","00;46;19;05","00;46;20;23","Adam, what would you add in there?"
"Speaker 3","00;46;23;08","00;47;19;24","Well, first, I don't I love that metaphor just now. And the another thing I would add is so like, you know, on my end, like I'm trying to use this is like abstractions for understanding, you know, aspects of like brain functioning. So let's say we're talking about these you know, this top level. This is one way of interpreting like the hippocampal place cells and these whether you create a new node or not, based on what threshold of familiarity or surprise this would potentially be like an example, I think of X, an extremely powerful source of individual differences like maybe you could think of this in terms of like positioning and like assimilation or accommodation, but"
"Speaker 3","00;47;19;24","00;47;49;09","you could see like if your thresholds are too low or too high, you could end up representing a domain in ways with their other. Like you can get false, you can get things that are like excessively granular or insufficiently granular to represent the domain, and you can get different types of errors associated with it. And so like this, for instance, could define even the things like more like some people are talking like autism to schizophrenia spectrums."
"Speaker 3","00;47;49;09","00;48;10;08","And so there could be like kind of underlying predispositions for this it might actually be. I think that's an oversimplification. But you could think of these thresholds as some cognitive spectrum. This might just fall out of them. As you get different types of minds. If you have like a more granular, like an overly inclusive or an utterly inclusive category structure."
"Speaker 3","00;48;10;27","00;49;01;22","But some other things like just trying and this would be like if we're talking about this, you know, lower level and if we're thinking of like these like internal grid cells as well, not quite being well, the posts here are like red cells, but this idea of like this mapping of your what your body position is and where you're oriented and then having this conjoined with what's in your visual field and then using these sources of information to mutually constrain each other and using where you are in space and these all being necessary for instance, this seems to be fundamentally what was needed to get the robots to work."
"Speaker 3","00;49;01;22","00;49;47;01","And we have not so dissimilar sensors in effectors and so once I was you know, I think it's got a tumor has just messed up his name but he has this interesting paper and like default mode system as it's called a dark control and thinking of it as doing like tree search. But to loop it around this pose information, it's somewhat like the posterior nodes of the demon are actually helping to encode this information like if you go like to the parietal portions that actually might be where is my body where it's reflected."
"Speaker 3","00;49;47;01","00;50;37;29","And then if you're going like to these midline portions of it, the you know, what's in my visual field or what am I imagining? And then if you want to go for like this future part, that might be like the anterior portions. So like the demon or the semiofficial cortex, maybe coupling with the hippocampal anterior, the campus, but basically it would seem that like the stream, these core aspects of the model might be ways of functionally understanding the core aspects of an ancient architecture used for mental stimulation that there just seems to be a striking amount of convergence between the things that people like Tim are identifying as just like what's necessary, how do we"
"Speaker 3","00;50;37;29","00;51;10;25","solve a problem? And the features of neuronal organization that would be these two defaults or canonical processes that you just you're seeing it as a as really just fundamental you know, we call it a default purposely active all the time. What's it doing maybe part of what it's doing is it's allowing us to do this kind of navigation through space and time yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;51;11;01","00;51;12;02","So those are some touch."
"Speaker 1","00;51;14;10","00;51;43;02","Navigation through space and time in these sort of territory. Sense would be clock time and metric space what is your X-Y-Z T? And then navigation through mental space and time might have some resonances or analogies, but it's not a piece of paper. So what is it and how does it become realized through ecology, evolution and development? So awesome points."
"Speaker 1","00;51;43;02","00;51;43;15","Thank you."
"Speaker 3","00;51;44;06","00;52;06;29","Real quickly, in terms of the time issue, it seems like there's these multiple ways the time comes in. It's like one sense of like the sense of time as you might be doing like accumulation based on like the frequency with which you're having like meaningful informational events like but Craig calls these like global emotional moments, but an email and others have some."
"Speaker 3","00;52;07;00","00;52;39;03","I think Murray Shanahan's have some interesting models, like the sense of time in terms of like the amount of like information flux through your sensors. But then there's like another kind of time that might actually involve like over specialization of a trajectory. And you might be using something like path integration in terms of like how you're doing some types of duration estimation, not necessarily just like accumulating like like a sense of accumulation, but some of it might be like, where am I in navigating through a timeline?"
"Speaker 3","00;52;39;20","00;52;59;08","And I think you'll see this reflected in like the way people talk. And we could like dismiss this to say, I guess that's just more metaphor. No, I think that that metaphor is how we're actually constructing some sense of time, which actually gives us like forms of control that we would not have otherwise, where we not able to actually extend our minds metaphorically in that way."
"Speaker 3","00;52;59;18","00;53;07;19","And then be able to basically navigate through spatial time to keep track of some longer time sequences if we want to plan with respect to them."
"Speaker 1","00;53;09;00","00;53;10;18","Awesome. Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;53;12;28","00;53;50;06","Hello. Great to see you. And I was curious in terms of time. Well, one of the things is do you think time is or this process is distributed around different parts of the sensor and processing because different sensor them have different speeds or different rates or different abilities. And then the other thing coming back to time as well is people can be going through time they can be like or they can be time can come towards them or a time can be sort of developing around them, which often happens in Asian cultures."
"Speaker 4","00;53;50;06","00;54;04;16","It's a time it's seen more as something that's around them. So I'm curious, like how these these ideas of temporality might might link to the ways that we imagine ourselves. We are sensor."
"Speaker 3","00;54;12;10","00;54;55;28","I mean, if it is indeed the case that some forms of the spatial association, if it's a case of spatial rising time that's happening both in some cases through some some fairly abstract metaphorical linguistic constructions, then this would imply that you should be able to get meaningful cultural differences based on these shared constructions and maybe even some quasi like work in effects where like linguistic modifications could actually change the way people are seeing themselves and others in relation to time with some fairly significant consequences."
"Speaker 3","00;54;56;14","00;55;18;09","So when we're working on effects to contact the jargon of just like the idea that the our thought is constrained in some meaningful way by the constraints and affordances of our language, our constraints, influences the way we think. There's like stronger and weaker versions of that hypothesis."
"Speaker 1","00;55;19;22","00;55;20;01","Thank you."
"Speaker 2","00;55;20;01","00;56;08;08","Blue So it's interesting because as we've been talking about like spatial maps and spatial contexts like spatial representation, navigating through space, I have been thinking a lot about semantic navigation also like when we're looking through, looking for a thought when we're looking for navigating foraging for information or, you know, in these context rich domains and they just wonder what like is the semantic navigation related to linked to like is there overlap in the brain in the way that we process semantic orientation and representation and space also?"
"Speaker 2","00;56;08;13","00;56;09;26","So I'm just curious."
"Speaker 1","00;56;12;08","00;56;13;14","Hashtag maps of meaning."
"Speaker 3","00;56;21;17","00;56;56;05","Maybe I can I can respond to this from from my perspective and then I'll probably have to leave you guys. But so I think one of the most important things of this to me of all of a whole this this whole endeavor of of constructing this and doing it together with Adam, is that we basically we start off with this robot navigation, which is from this perspective, this really like about X and Y position and about times and seconds."
"Speaker 3","00;56;56;25","00;57;26;05","But what we do here is we by by creating this model, we basically get rid of this loci of being ground within seconds and meters basically. I think this is one of the most crucial aspects of of our model because it shows that well, on the one hand, I think we all agree that we don't get bored measuring diamond seconds and measuring space and meters."
"Speaker 3","00;57;26;19","00;58;11;04","So we actually get at least the framework that also gets rid of these these metrics and just learn to navigate in this more abstract space. And if we can get it to work for navigation for, say, moving through actual physical space, then I'm pretty sure that we can also extend the model further to navigate any space because in the end, this once we are at the lowest, we get the level above our sensory inputs, then everything is in our case, just learn these things basically."
"Speaker 3","00;58;11;18","00;58;39;19","So if we can, if we can make this work for physical navigation, I think we're all already a big step closer to, to making it work for, for any navigation. And indeed, we come to the realm of like you said, I have lots of memories these are tied together somehow because how, how these memories just came to be, can I now navigate this space towards the memory that I'm looking for?"
"Speaker 3","00;58;40;03","00;59;11;14","Or if you are solving a math problem, how do you navigate the space of medications through get the solution for this thing? I think once you get rid of that, the time and space that that's so tight for your your sensorium and move towards the more abstract space and be able to navigate that this is this is the crucial the crucial bit here, I would say."
"Speaker 3","00;59;12;06","00;59;21;27","So with that. So I'd like to thank you for for the discussion. So now I'll try to be there next week. As well and I enjoyed the discussion further."
"Speaker 1","00;59;22;18","00;59;59;04","Thank you, Tim. You cool. Very interesting. And also speaking to that cultural basis, there was the inch foot pound paradigm and that has in certain places also coexisted or been complementary or contradictory with the centimeters, grams second is based upon something different and what would happen if a larva was born. And the little one, the second was like what we call 3 seconds is that just a more chill larva?"
"Speaker 1","00;59;59;17","01;00;26;15","Because every one of its moments is taking a few more heartbeats. It can actually take a breath per little one. So there's a lot that we probably don't even know, how much we don't know. And so we're in feedback with these models that both fully realized not just in the equations, but in the actual robotics grounding us in those actual observations of red, green, blue pixel intensities."
"Speaker 1","01;00;26;26","01;00;43;11","Which is like when Adam was saying that robotics are an empirical platform to be studying the nature of cognition and brain in mind. And then here is where we move into a different space in time. And so that is an excellent point by Tim."
"Speaker 4","01;00;43;29","01;01;12;05","Stephen Yeah. So following on from what you're saying, Daniel, as we know, Tim just mentioned about, you know, have the abstracted ideas but there's also maybe the grounded you mentioned grounded ways of knowing. So it might be that the future we abstract out what we think it might be and then there may be ways where we feel what's riots, what feels."
"Speaker 4","01;01;12;16","01;01;38;29","So you hit a door and you feel there's an information affordance and it could be grounds. So I was wondering how much that can that supports not needing to have the metrics, like you say, and maybe the metrics that we've created like the second apart because they're at that kind of sweet spot. OK, somehow close to a sweet, sweet spot of what sort of makes sense."
"Speaker 4","01;01;39;08","01;01;56;23","You know, someone had to decide on a foot or a hand, you know, so was it the small person's hand was the big person's hand? And they sort of said, well, what about John? I maybe was the king, I don't know. But it got decided somehow. So I think this is a a good question about ground universe is an abstraction."
"Speaker 4","01;01;56;23","01;01;59;16","I don't know what the what the thoughts are on that."
"Speaker 1","01;02;00;22","01;02;38;14","Yes. This higher level in a purely metric model, it could be like, well, on the bottom level, we're dealing with centimeters and 100 milliseconds frames. And the core screening is at the level of 100 times the spatial distance and 100 times the temporal distance. What this model is doing is something different and I think that is, again, this biological inspiration, which is that what is happening in the level that the action perception loop is nested within is not just of a bigger version."
"Speaker 1","01;02;39;21","01;03;02;00","Well, it both is in essence because it has some resonance graphical structures that support the compose ability and the tracked ability of active models. Yet also it's doing something that's categorically difference, which is navigating in a more topological space rather than the more geometric space down the bottom. What do you I'm thinking about."
"Speaker 3","01;03;07;05","01;03;29;17","It seems like with the well, I guess one is I suspect it is near no coincidence that seconds are about the time extended that they are and that we have like the metric units we use like a foot or a meter or a yard in terms of like in terms of grounding and in terms of connection to affordance."
"Speaker 3","01;03;30;02","01;04;12;01","So like a second for maybe, you know, a relation to signal maybe like heart rates or certain biophysical pattern generators or like the scope of working memory being an iconic memory being stable on different scales or like a yard or a meter like the basically the reach of your arm like Harry personal space and like a field of affordances around your body was particularly concentrated and so, you know, these are ways in which like for instance, like the granularity of our modeling would be influenced by language or their language would reflect it and maybe to different extents influence it."
"Speaker 3","01;04;12;01","01;04;52;06","But you would have like this other kind of granularity of space that might be different for different species, but also within a species and with an individual like for instance, like these like tilings of like hippocampal system, like layout, things like titans of space for each house domain. And they'll have like a kind of the they'll be refreshed like maybe it looks like like every 3 seconds or so, but if you're in like a big space, but this tiling will actually attack of hexagonal arrays and just like hexagonal time, it will fill whatever space and then it'll have different levels of granularity."
"Speaker 3","01;04;52;27","01;05;15;09","And so if you're in like a big space, it's going to necessarily be less granular. And if you're in a small space, it'll be probably be more green. But there's other things that influence the granularity. Also like there's like brainstem locomotor nuclei, they're like detecting how fast are you moving? And then this will influence the granularity of like kind of space."
"Speaker 3","01;05;15;29","01;05;48;25","And so that's like some of it you know, some of this what is relevant now, some of this is a greening of a domain, some of it will be affected by like these basically innate, like architectural inductive biases. And some of them will be more like sociocultural or constructed ones. And just moving on as opposed to say like how?"
"Speaker 3","01;05;49;23","01;06;33;01","Tim Russert does one hell of a mike drop because, you know, what you're saying is like basically. Yeah. So he's already solved like in terms of kinds of grounding. Like not only is this like potentially a way of having an architecture capable of navigating conceptual domains and abstractions, basically with NGO like system two way, I or what some would call like strong A.I., but it's also grounding in that it actually works as a control system for an embodied embedded agent and so now you might have a single system capable of both giving you simple grounding by allowing something to be in the world alongside other agents."
"Speaker 3","01;06;33;23","01;07;07;27","And have actual actual semantics in terms of pointing to things in the world, like taking a kind of like a semantic network of just like symbols pointing at symbols. But ultimately these such a system would allow you to ground out your semantic network and things in the world and shared symbols and so, I mean, ultimately, this is a path to, you know, who knows how far, you know, anyone working on it today gets, but this is ultimately a path to A.I. built that takes on an activist principles of what you would need to do."
"Speaker 3","01;07;07;27","01;07;11;11","So which is more than a little exciting to think."
"Speaker 1","01;07;12;07","01;07;47;25","Oh, I'm starting to see why people are interested in this excellent point about the symbolic semantics and logic and how that connects to the inactive insight, the pragmatic turn, ecological psychology, biosimilars is like all of these features that get left on the cutting block. If we take a computational linguistics approach only and computational linguistics plus the mouth movements already, one has incorporated that pragmatic turn in that embodiment element."
"Speaker 1","01;07;47;25","01;07;54;14","And that's quite a different model than just the substrate independence symbol manipulator. Stephen."
"Speaker 4","01;07;55;13","01;08;26;20","Right. Yeah, I think it's exciting indeed, because it can open up a lot of I'm very interested in mental space psychology and very personal space and working with space as an instrument and well, I'm more than interested in it. That's my main focus in many ways. And but what's really been the challenge is giving it a plausible bridge right back because they're working primarily on looking at what action policies are and what has been enacted."
"Speaker 4","01;08;27;20","01;08;58;27","And it's very hard to go back to observations because you're coming from the other direction. So I think it'd be very interesting to see what this robot, whether you could actually see. Well, what kind of robot is this robot? What's it like? What kind of story patterning gets triggered by this robot? And maybe if I grew up with a slightly heavier wheel on one side or something, it has a slightly different character, you know?"
"Speaker 4","01;08;59;06","01;09;14;17","So I mean, I wonder if there's a kind of an actual a way that the action policies themselves start to encode a server personality based on the physicality and sensor that get weighted."
"Speaker 3","01;09;18;04","01;09;58;10","I mean, that would be like in terms of this generalization of slam principles as a way of understanding cognition more generally. I think that would be like a great test case and that those are the kinds of hypotheses you would look for. I think like if you're real is like weighted more heavily on one side or the other that can have all sorts of things like for instance, like, like what Tim was describing like this know creation where it's not just a function of like a metrics, but on information and the and so this creates like a distorted space, but, but an adaptively distorted space."
"Speaker 3","01;09;58;10","01;10;19;22","You would expect usually because multiple forms of value are influencing the granularity of this sort of space. Like that's always like a map. It's like space is a graph, but a graph being shaped by multiple kinds of value and so you would expect things like that kind of real asymmetry you're talking about to result in different kinds of graph spaces."
"Speaker 3","01;10;20;00","01;10;57;10","And this could then potentially have some transfer more generally across more than just physical spaces in theory. Also, you know, coming back to like that granularity issue like let's say like the way you move through the world is quicker or slower. That itself then might have transferred not just to, well, how is it that I'm representing the space I'm physically moving through, but that then could get reflected in cognitive styles in terms of like the way you relate to like semantic spaces in terms of the way you're going to forge through them, what you consider to be near or far connections."
"Speaker 3","01;10;57;22","01;11;25;14","So like this is the kind of like that would be like a whole research program, which would be but using this as like a source of bridging principles of like so some connection between embodied experience and then more abstract thinking. Well, maybe this is a source of some of the ways in which concrete and body experiences go on to shape been basically thought in the more abstract level as well."
"Speaker 1","01;11;30;03","01;12;09;09","Very, very interesting. And especially when we think about the mental action papers that we've read like Livestream number 25 with Sanford Smith at all about metacognition as mental action. And so in this two level robotics case, we're talking about the sort of lower level motion and then the higher level navigation of locations where we can say, I want to go to the post office and then the grocery store, but then we have this more tactical taking a step timescale that's a lot faster if this bottom layer is based upon cognition and perception."
"Speaker 1","01;12;09;18","01;12;41;18","Also, this higher level is not just navigation in the warehouse. That's actually like where do I wants to be in my regime of attention, or what would I like to be considering from a metacognitive perspective? How do I navigate to a place where I prefer was healthy for me? So there's all kinds of other questions about navigation in parameter spaces that are not just like top of logically, the cousin of the warehouse space, but truly in the mental space, fully blue."
"Speaker 1","01;12;41;18","01;12;42;05","And then Steve."
"Speaker 2","01;12;44;22","01;13;10;19","So since we brought up Hierarchical here in the paper, it looks like, I mean, I can hold this for ten, Adam two if you don't feel comfortable talking about it, but maybe, maybe you're good in the hierarchical space. It seems that it's just a course screening like in this paper, right? So like, you know, the, the higher level is just like a core screen version of what happens at the lower level."
"Speaker 2","01;13;11;03","01;13;35;18","And it's easy to see how that takes place or takes shape in like a topographical way that it doesn't leave a lot of room for emergence and I wonder, like if we jump to thinking about a semantic space, you know, we have words and that the relationships with words to each other, proximity, you know, how close do you expect to find, you know, there to was or whatever."
"Speaker 2","01;13;35;25","01;14;03;06","So how how linked are the words together in a semantic space? But I wonder if you can go into topic modeling and that gives you like a kind of a queer screaming. But like is there more room for emergence in that kind of space? Maybe or like what other like how do you I don't know. How would you just allow for emergent things to come through in this kind of hierarchical modeling or mapping."
"Speaker 3","01;14;06;16","01;14;57;05","I think when Sam comes back, it could be worth it for him to go into more detail on the parameters that go into node creation or not, because I feel like to the extent that you're getting some flexibility in ways of understanding like emergence that would be your your models of emergence and where you are, that that would be like where you would basically create this course grained ontology of different levels of granularity what what constitutes like an occasion for course screening of all kinds it seems like the node creation would be where your assumptions about that of what kinds of emergency might be dealing with."
"Speaker 3","01;14;58;18","01;15;19;21","That's where would come into this kind of model. Is it rich enough to account for all of them? I wouldn't quite say that in terms of like, you know, all the different forms of emergence you can get. So some of it, you know, but that is fair. But by enough, I mean, you know, enough to be a full on general intelligence."
"Speaker 3","01;15;20;03","01;15;33;19","But but but I do think there is room for some some flexibility there at that parameter ization of of terms model. But he would explain it better than I would."
"Speaker 1","01;15;36;18","01;15;58;28","Make a comment and then ask a question in the chat and then also see Stephen. So it was mentioned that there is the embodiment of certain prior information in the continuous attractor network. Like if my position is this and I move forward, then that is putting me into this different position in the can and blue asked about topic modeling and semantic spaces."
"Speaker 1","01;15;58;28","01;16;49;25","So that territory is different. So the maps should be appropriately different and so we could say, for example, like California is nested within the United States, that is not violating any geographical priors. But what about a paper that's interdisciplinary that might be at the intersection of two different topics or depending on how those topic models are generated, one could think of every paper as existing across 100 different topics to different quantitative amounts and so it actually does bring us to this question which it has asked, which is we're hearing a lot in the paper in the natural speech and so on, different complementarities lower and higher."
"Speaker 1","01;16;50;21","01;17;21;06","So here with the lower model is the finer scale and the the red. I'm not I'm trying not to mix metaphors, but lower and higher is sometimes used with inner and outer or finer and coarser core screening. More specific, more general. So what is that restaurant where those are the dishes how could it something be above or below and you get it, but it could also be more like a kernel and more like the fruit."
"Speaker 1","01;17;21;06","01;17;38;08","And you get it and it could be more like sand or more like gravel and you would get it. What does that mean or say well, think and then allow Adam to speak first."
"Speaker 3","01;18;02;27","01;18;36;15","I think that's a deep and complex question. And there's a couple levels or a couple entry points there, but one thing is, like you mentioned, like inner and outer is another way of describing, I suppose, the higher and lower. And there's a, I think, connection between this art this late and some architecture and like and metal learning where you're having like a more fine grained process for like that's more asks just this back and forth for like adaptive fine grained couplings."
"Speaker 3","01;18;36;15","01;19;04;03","But then you nest that are there, you create like an outer loop, which is like a slower aggregation process that's coarser but then allows for sharing of information across episodes. So it's a kind of like this is basically a kind of metal learning system and giving you this divide and conquer approach of like levels of granularity, I don't think anyone quite knows gets what the significance of this is."
"Speaker 3","01;19;04;03","01;19;44;01","But one interesting thing about the grid cells, as they seem to have a multi scale hierarchy in their organization in terms of there's this axis I believe is as you go within entering the cortex, as you go more like more dorsal to eventual or more superior to the inferior it you'll get these like discrete cut offs of potentially implants, kind of harmonic nesting of scales, maybe even coupling with like multi scales, like synchronous dynamics and cortex."
"Speaker 3","01;19;44;01","01;20;35;11","Unclear, but there does seem to be these like multiple scales reflected in the end grid scales and internal processes having different levels of granularity of their spatial representations and the thing that's interesting I'm curious about is like what are the one thing I'm curious about is like to what degree, for instance, do differently neuro modular systems like some of the ways in which like they could be understood in terms of having their functions as maybe like influencing which granularity is most present, like moving into like now in a situation of like attending to the fine granules and or this is a situation where we're going to really go coarse and just ignore those details."
"Speaker 3","01;20;35;21","01;20;53;03","And there's some neurobiologist racisms there and their effects on like General Dynamics might actually be best explained. It might be. Well, explain in terms of this like adaptive changing of the granularity very cool."
"Speaker 1","01;20;53;03","01;21;14;15","And we see that in teamwork where sometimes it's time to control paced and just fill out the spreadsheet. Other times it's time to add a column to the spreadsheet. Other times there are this open ended ness to the task and including the local objectives and also even broader mission and one's own relationship to the team and the project."
"Speaker 1","01;21;14;15","01;21;28;12","So perhaps if there's a similar biological substrate, then it would stand to reason that there could be multiple representations that are emitted from some kind of common generative model."
"Speaker 3","01;21;30;03","01;22;07;02","I'm one up for forget. So one thing that I'm actually really interested in is exploring these same principles and the in case because they have like analogous and potentially largely homologous systems of the central complex. And I feel like that's like an area like I'm looking to look into next is like to really understand these things, not just looking at the mammal case, but when I look at the inset case with the central complex and see the similarities and differences, what what special adaptations were there, what to what extent are the functions realized by similar means are different means."
"Speaker 3","01;22;07;02","01;22;34;01","But there's some in terms of like a way of understanding things like like that neuro modulator hypothesis of like influencing like the granularity of spatial modeling as possible, although I wouldn't necessarily bet on outcome based on conversations with you, David, but it's possible that you're getting like extensive homology and common significances for things like flexible influencing of the granularity and the forging parameters."
"Speaker 3","01;22;34;15","01;23;01;10","It's possible those are like remarkably conserved and that you might actually see them. That being said, like you also were alluding to, though, the salmon since is different in insects about this is this is a multi slam in general. There's a lot of what is happening in vertebrates also, but I think not to the same degree and that so you might expect some potentially substantial differences there as a result of the same problem being having that additional way."
"Speaker 3","01;23;01;10","01;23;07;26","It's different set of challenges and sources of information I can leverage."
"Speaker 1","01;23;09;20","01;23;14;19","I can't wait for solitary wasp slam and you social colony slam."
"Speaker 3","01;23;15;11","01;23;15;20","Even."
"Speaker 4","01;23;18;09","01;24;07;03","From what I'm hearing you could you could correlate these multi slams to regimes of attention in many ways because that that could take the nature of these granularity and where they are in the space, in the place in the body. So because we often assume I think when blue is saying they're about there's this inner outer and the sum of those are also false assumptions that that rolls out over everything that we so in the sense that in a is pure and higher is pure but often that might depend on the multi slam that's been done at the time yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;24;07;09","01;24;32;02","Like one other than blue, like coarser and finer, slower and faster. So one interpretation would be that the slower time scale is the coarser draining in the sense that it's like seconds, not milliseconds, and the finer is the faster. But there's also maybe an interpretation where actually the if you're clicking up mile by mile instead of foot by foot, that is actually moving faster and it's coarser."
"Speaker 1","01;24;32;11","01;24;59;22","And if you're counting grains of sand at a time, it's finer and slower. So I think even sometimes the direction that one interprets is not there, but it doesn't remove the dialectical nature or the intermodal nature. But the way that is, it going to be like a sugar with all the O-H is pointing down or all the O-H is pointing up or some blend has to go one way or the other."
"Speaker 1","01;24;59;22","01;25;04;02","But maybe it doesn't have to be any one specific way."
"Speaker 2","01;25;04;24","01;25;37;20","Blue so I am wondering, and this is also interesting in terms of the insects case, if there is some kind of maybe like a generic pre installed like readily adaptable course screened version of a place. So like that's just kind of there is like a generic representation. So like a perfect example. I mean, when you're thinking about screening like a map at a location, like you know where everything is in your house, like, you know, where your bathroom is and you know where all the things are."
"Speaker 2","01;25;38;11","01;25;57;29","But you know, when you travel, you have an expectation. Even if you've never been to the hotel before, you have the expectation of what the elevator's going to sound like, how the carpet all looks the same with that funky, weird pattern in the hallways, twist and turn. And like when you get into the hotel room, there's going to be a bathroom and there's going to be a window and there's going to be bed and a TV and a remote."
"Speaker 2","01;25;58;05","01;26;19;10","So you have this like pre generic supposition of how the hotel is going to look. Does that live in a place? So somewhere that just like morphs into, oh, the bathrooms here and the lights here so that you're not stumbling around in the middle of the night. And similarly, like, there's all kinds of when you go out hiking, you know, you expect there to be trees and rocks and stuff outside."
"Speaker 2","01;26;19;10","01;26;30;10","And so do you just like mash your map on to like some preexisting generic place holder a place so place holder. It's interesting to think about."
"Speaker 1","01;26;35;07","01;26;54;24","It's like a prior for the abstract space prior distribution over hotel rooms, which is totally in culture and totally based upon experience. And then either one is surprised or not just as with when any other prior meets sense I'm Adam. What do you think of that, Steve?"
"Speaker 3","01;26;56;28","01;27;38;08","I mean, these are details that are definitely out here beyond the edge of anything I or maybe anyone knows, but the I guess I like these how many different so one way that these place feels or sometimes modeled is in terms of like these like chained attractors and so like within the hippocampus system, like you can get like this highly recurrent activity, especially in some of the sub fields and you can set up like that this such of like these densities of return activity."
"Speaker 3","01;27;38;08","01;27;57;29","And then you can have like information kind of moving between them as a predictive map, not just of like not just like here's the things, but you know, people that have better things. Like Gershman talks about census representations, but there's a transition structure of which a chapter will act. Which of the places will activate first in the sequence."
"Speaker 3","01;27;59;06","01;28;22;26","And and so I guess the question, the question I'm wondering is like so like, you know, you're encountering like a new scene and you're like laying down like a set of landmarks or a timeline of space. Like to what degree is this information encoded in in what circumstances and to what degree is it encoded in like the local connectivity within that mechanical system?"
"Speaker 3","01;28;22;26","01;28;42;04","And whether you're getting like this set of schemas that you're going to like drop like the most similar one based on some degree of similarity will cause like one attractor that works to get pulled up over another. And now this is the challenge you're working within. And this is like the policies that the policy set you're likely to be pulling from."
"Speaker 3","01;28;42;15","01;29;20;12","And this is your framing of the domain or to what degree is it relying more heavily on like the moments of moments like cortical dynamics and like the mental simulation that might be happening and to what extent is it constrained by the history of plasticity within the hippocampus? What schemas are going to be operative and to what degree is it more of a negotiation where it's going to be more abstract, more determined by the moments when the contingencies and this funneling through the whole like cortical virtual reality machinery, everyone's sick of it."
"Speaker 3","01;29;21;26","01;29;49;29","And to what degree is this that there's not one answer? This varies both across and within individuals. This is actually like a core aspect of cybernetic functioning. This is actually leaning more heavily on the progress or the current of established over more of more learning and exploring or leaning more on like the situationally specific factors like how much do you shoehorn what's going on into your existing schemas, how much you assimilate, how much do you accommodate?"
"Speaker 3","01;29;50;11","01;30;19;13","And at this thing, potentially like a flexible parameter and maybe some of that flexibility is like is like baked into the logic of neuro modulators, like actually flexibly influencing is unclear, but they're very free as of anything. But it's very much like part of the excitement for me is like wondering like is this like does this provide like a functional and algorithmic significance for like this?"
"Speaker 3","01;30;19;13","01;30;30;02","Like otherwise like just mass of like biological details, like do some of them have like elegant cybernetic understandings by virtue of like thinking of these kinds of questions?"
"Speaker 2","01;30;31;14","01;30;32;05","Can I just respond?"
"Speaker 1","01;30;32;24","01;30;33;08","Yes, please."
"Speaker 2","01;30;33;08","01;30;55;21","The so that made me think a whole bunch about like maybe we don't need a map, a place self for each individual hotel room but it's like a node when we're discussing nodes earlier, like a core screens, just an attractive space like dump all of the hotel room maps into this little nodules. So that when you get to a hotel room, it's all the same thing."
"Speaker 2","01;30;55;21","01;31;19;08","Like it's OK. I've been here before, even if you've never been to that kind of place. And that would kind of explain things like Deja Vu, like when you get to a place like I've been here before, when did I come here? Like when you're driving down a street, didn't I just drive down the street? It just lumped over there into that little attractor mesh node that's not necessarily a specific place, but just like a squishy ball of similar places."
"Speaker 1","01;31;21;03","01;31;52;15","And also really love how we spoke about some of these things. Adam and your collaboration with Collin DeYoung, Cybernetic Big Five in Livestream, number 13 I think at the beginning of 20, 21 and now we're revisiting same but different more things change the more they stay the same. And this idea of like modulatory features of cybernetic systems as being important for variation within and among individuals is just such an essential point."
"Speaker 1","01;31;52;15","01;31;57;09","And it's so true that a lot of the details are yet to be resolved. Stephen."
"Speaker 4","01;31;58;27","01;32;27;13","Yeah, you could go a bit further still because what if you don't have maps put to one side that this action policies actually have interest in how much this is feasible, but action policies that recapitulate something like a map, so like by an embodiment, by an inactive chain of or initiation of some actions at different scales, it basically recapitulates some sort of nascent starting point."
"Speaker 4","01;32;27;25","01;33;04;24","So you don't have to have any representations there. And like when the door is engaged, the set of actions that that does that creates could open up an effectively a map. So I don't know how much between I mean, I know in this model it does start to create a network of attractors, but I'm wondering whether how much things could be sparked off from engage in a particular affordance, a particular meaningfulness in something I mean."
"Speaker 3","01;33;06;00","01;33;53;05","There's actually like a live debate about like the extent to which it's like Tolman initially was talking about the hippocampal cognitive memory. And part of the reason people like to talk about maps is because of the flexibility they give you in terms of if you like, the map serves as a generative model and like it gives you like a like I can flexibly actually set to generate trajectories, but you can do that with a well structured graph also, but there's like a spectrum of interpretations of people thinking that you're dealing with more things that are more map like and things that are more context specific and graphs like and flexible and more dynamically constructed."
"Speaker 3","01;33;53;12","01;34;35;03","And it seems like it's kind of a cop up. And I'm like, I always like take every debate and I'm like, you're probably both right. And so it's like you want like for the sake of I guess maybe stability or for the sake of potentially greater transfer of understandings and inferential power across episodes. You might want something more map like, but if you go to map like you're losing like the ability to deal like the nuances of like specific context and so, you know, so this again might be like different perspectives on the same thing that tend to converge with tradeoffs."
"Speaker 3","01;34;35;03","01;35;19;07","Like you could have more context sensitive or more situationally invariant representations, and these could reflect cognitive styles and maybe like fundamental axes of variation for cognition and sense making yeah. The one thing that in terms of like cybernetics generally of like earlier like, you know, like drawing Peterson like parties. Like it's actually interesting that maps of meeting Peterson's book was actually heavily informed by concepts and affective neuroscience and ecological models more generally, like based on things like animal foraging."
"Speaker 3","01;35;19;20","01;35;36;07","So I actually think that's where Jordan Peterson got that rhetoric about maps is actually from doing a kind of affective neuroscience perspective grounded in this ecological perspective. Of foraging animals. And so, yeah, I think that's actually where that came from."
"Speaker 1","01;35;37;24","01;36;09;28","Yes, very nice. And I think I agree, and we may have even explored as such in, in one paper reimagining maps that I wrote with RJ and a colleague Michael we learned about this historical distinction between archival maps and itinerary maps. And today we just think about maps as being like one more lumpy category. But there's many differences between the map that actually is like a multi map or a mega map and holds a lot of information potentially in a metric way versus the itinerary map."
"Speaker 1","01;36;10;10","01;36;48;18","Head straight until you see the two big trees. Then you're going to want to take a left, that type of more conversational or casual or navigable map that is highly contextual and with current map systems. That's one of the challenges because we have that mega map. It's downloadable, but it's not going to fit on your phone. So what is the projection that's contextual and situational that's actually going to enable effective action that is also going to be perceived as map like by the user on yes, blue OK."
"Speaker 2","01;36;49;05","01;37;23;27","So this is like a personal attack in question. So anybody who spent any kind of time with Daniel knows that he's constantly drawing or writing or writing things down like all the time taking notes, taking notes, taking notes. And I wonder, like, can you take your notes as like a mental map of where you were at that time that you were making that drawing like it does it like recapitulate your conversations that you're having the ideas that were running through your head, like can you use these drawings that you're always doing as like a kind of conversational, like mental space map."
"Speaker 1","01;37;26;12","01;37;49;20","If anything, it's the opposite. I just leave the thought behind. And if we look at this and think, OK, something happened by which we wrote this down it would be awesome if there were as many people with a regime of attention on taking live notes. I know that's not an approach for everybody, but then we could all look at that Shared Ferryman distribution and then make it new again."
"Speaker 1","01;37;49;26","01;38;02;17","And maybe we remember our exact previous thought, though. That's impossible. Or or unlikely. But instead we can make the relationship with the material and with those notes like new again."
"Speaker 4","01;38;03;18","01;38;37;27","Stephen Yes, maybe a little harder to categorize with language, but in a way it's the traces of your action policies. Even if it was captured in the interpretation. So one thing I'm very interested in is how we can realign things to action because we've kind of been enculturated to think it's all about thoughts and feelings, right? And because Action Act of inference puts it in this other domain, well, what does that mean?"
"Speaker 4","01;38;38;10","01;39;05;03","And how do we talk about active inference when we're coaching culture to think through other natural ways of using English? I'm finding that a big challenge myself, but I think so as you're laying down those traces, all you show in your action policies of how to record something rather than your thoughts, if that makes sense, and if your thoughts always slightly hidden."
"Speaker 1","01;39;06;19","01;39;56;03","Yeah, great question. Just like we were thinking about earlier with a sort of substrate implicit agnostic ignored linguistic symbolic models like a Turing tape. It has infinite space and it can just make infinite grammar. And so that sort of purely symbolic approach to language and then its relationship to thought and experience is one question. But when we think about finite actual sequences of language, use and deployment as action, either keyboard typing or assisted typing technology or speaking as also a motor action, it totally changes the game because we're not just in this forest of infinite plausible grammars, but rather one realized and preferred action sequence."
"Speaker 1","01;39;56;03","01;40;32;16","And then of course, thoughts are unobserved, but the actions are not. And that's the whole quantum reference frame and share generative model and rhetorical nature, narrative nature of cognition. And so indeed the the action insight I think is going to be something that we'll keep returning to. We have a final closing the plane or whatever and I'll also just give a little preview, which is that next week we're going to be having a guest stream with Adam."
"Speaker 1","01;40;33;02","01;40;51;25","So if it relates at all, Adam, how does it relate? What is the guest going to be about? And then that's in your absence. What would be exciting to discuss in 42.20."
"Speaker 3","01;40;53;02","01;41;14;21","You're right. There is a stream. A quick thought, though, so I blew. You're suggesting like Daniel's notes could serve almost like a kind of memory palace and accessible map. And then, Daniel, you're saying it's more like a stigma just stick mechanism for coordination, like with pointing and cueing. And that's interesting."
"Speaker 3","01;41;17;00","01;42;04;28","I wonder if like when people are reading books, like the ability to like use the book instead of like as a map slash palace gives it better retention than something like a Kindle, like a book is like a physical object. That was so. Yeah, free will. And so because if your next to me, I would say that basically so somebody like over a hypothesis is that like all of the details or are there that many of the details that Tim is using for these systems will end up being relevant as abstract interpretations of the core parameters of us as active inferential cybernetic systems, both with respect to basically the basics of let's just be in"
"Speaker 3","01;42;04;28","01;42;38;03","the world and embodied way as far as living life, living robots, but also in terms of their extension to high level cognition, scaling active inference to more complex domains. And so like in general, like I I'm trying to understand with limited success with as many details as I can optimize work because I think it's just some of the most promising sources of constraints we have on inference interpretations and sources of hypotheses."
"Speaker 3","01;42;38;03","01;43;16;21","So basically whatever details Jane is willing to get into, I think you'll be well, well worth while to try to grok those. And that's what I'm that's what I'm doing in terms of next week so some of this is relevant and that the basic idea would be that these phenomenon, these studies in which people are seeing these slowly building potentials leading up to action that have predictive information where they peak in advance of people claiming that they have decided to take actions."
"Speaker 3","01;43;16;29","01;43;42;12","And where these studies are interpreted as evidence that people don't have free will, we can get into, you know, all sorts of conversations about how we what makes how it makes sense to think of free will in different ways, what it makes sense to talk about it all but that these studies are usually interpreted as saying that you're consciously experienced mental states cannot enter causal streams leading to action."
"Speaker 3","01;43;43;04","01;44;28;09","And so what I'm suggesting is that is not the case and that there's multiple ways in which your subjective states are meaningfully causal. If we think of what's leading up to something like deciding to move your hand and like an experiment, if that is reflecting a build up model evidence over your proprioceptive pose or of you deciding to take that action, this kind of evidence accumulation, if it's occurring via sophisticated and affective inference, that this would be a way of understanding it and that part of it would influence how much build up or not you get would be the specifics of this basically deep research from sophisticated enough that we might understand a sophisticated affective"
"Speaker 3","01;44;28;09","01;44;57;25","inference as being orchestrated by the hippocampal and insurance system as iterative mental stimulation, where you're sampling out these different possibilities of what it would be like if I move my arm or not. And then you're then evaluating that and your plant, you're peeling off these different counterfactuals and that if across these you get enough affective charge associated with going out to these forks, eventually this results in threshold crossing."
"Speaker 3","01;44;57;29","01;45;29;14","But the idea would be that so this would be relevant to some of the hippocampal SAM work and that you can think of this imaginative planning stage leading up to even seemingly spontaneous actions. You can think of this imaginative face as being largely orchestrated by the hippocampal system, which might be best understood as a general system for or a system for generalized foraging and mapping so nothing made sense, but that's like some of the connections."
"Speaker 1","01;45;30;02","01;45;50;05","Well, if you still want to come through the gas stream, you're welcome to do so. I know that. Thanks for the awesome summary and I know that we'll be able to unpack it a lot more next week on Blue or Stephen. What are some like last thoughts? What was exciting or interesting to you in Where We've Been and Where Shall We Forage next."
"Speaker 2","01;45;52;20","01;46;14;01","So I Can Go? I was really interested in taking this into semantic space, and I wonder what other kind of spaces that we can maybe think about mapping out how we build, how we construct maps, cognitive space and so forth. And I'm excited to talk to him about where we're emergence fits into that hierarchical model."
"Speaker 1","01;46;15;17","01;46;17;06","Awesome. Thank you. Blue Stephen."
"Speaker 4","01;46;18;16","01;46;43;23","Yeah, I think keeping the the idea of keeping things clean, keeping things nice and, and deflate re it even in this case here is really something I think to continue looking at. And I I'm really curious about what happens when we see that door and that door says you can go down that corridor. Am I going to go down into a different regime of attention?"
"Speaker 4","01;46;43;23","01;47;15;26","I'm going to stay where I am. So I think that that ability to take these principles and say, OK, what is it that happens when I encounter something and it triggers something, how much is that significant in terms of making things happen? And I'm curious then how that can marry with a lot of the mental space work that I do, building out metaphor landscapes or actually letting someone explore spatially."
"Speaker 4","01;47;16;06","01;47;38;07","And one last thing actually that came up, someone said to me the other day is there's really curious why when he picks up his plastic pencil, it doesn't mean as much to him as when he holds a shell. So there's something about like when that door has got some prior there's something that you know about being in the woodland versus being somewhere which is dead."
"Speaker 4","01;47;38;28","01;48;07;05","And even that itself could explain a lot about how navigating those places, the eco psychology of going into a wooded space, a living place actually can be important for people. Just seeing that in a wellness, what might seem a very woo woo type of stuff actually could be somehow linked to what we're talking about here. So we have brilliant things awesome."
"Speaker 1","01;48;07;20","01;48;45;28","Yeah. Very exciting and fun discussion. I really like that last piece, which is I know I'm going to carry forward and hopefully reflect on next week. How will we build that colony? Is it a memory palace? Blueprint, is it stigma, logic, coordination, but how? And so somewhere between the mental Alice Cathedral and the sort of picking up pebbles and having no bigger picture is where we are in our cognitive and social maps."
"Speaker 1","01;48;45;28","01;49;02;06","And so that's quite an area. And out of the central complex modeling, I can't wait. So thank you all for joining. Thanks, Tim. Also, so Adam, Stephen and Blue and Syd and Dean in the chat. So thanks everybody and see you next time."
