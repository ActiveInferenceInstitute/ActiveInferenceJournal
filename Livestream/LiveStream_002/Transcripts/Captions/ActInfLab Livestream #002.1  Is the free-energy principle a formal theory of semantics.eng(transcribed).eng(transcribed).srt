00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,640
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,480
welcome to team com podcast number two

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
this is going to be a journal discussion

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,519
of ramstead at all 2020

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
and it is going to be a great discussion

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,039
i'm really looking forward to it

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
so before we start off the discussion of

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,080
the paper

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
could the other two panelists introduce

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,439
themselves

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
maybe sasha first sure

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,079
hi my name is sasha i'm a neuroscientist

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,640
and

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
a free energy enthusiast

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
andy vaughn hello my name is iran and

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,399
i'm just interested in active inference

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,520
stuff

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600
and today we got to

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
read some soft book

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,199
yes absolutely a tough book so

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,960
does the screen look okay for sharing my

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,559
slides

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
all right here we go so the structure

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
of this discussion will be as follows

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,240
first we'll talk about some warm-up

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
questions

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,119
then we're going to jump into the paper

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,720
discussion we'll

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
go through the abstract and the big

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,560
questions making sure that we really

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,640
understand how the authors summarize

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
their own work

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
then we'll look at the roadmap of the

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,159
paper which are just the section headers

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,960
to understand

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
how they kind of get from a to z

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
we'll review some of the key claims and

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,600
the aims

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,079
of the paper so that we can evaluate

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,799
later on

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,640
whether the claims are justified or

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
whether they end up achieving the aims

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
that they set out to

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
to achieve then we're going to go

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,799
through

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
each of the six figures of the paper

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,119
and then um if not addressed during

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
a through d we'll have extra time at the

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,640
end to discuss

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
any other questions about the paper or

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
related topics and we have some other

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
figures that we could put up if we need

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
to

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
so here we go with the warm-up questions

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,399
first

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
what is semantics

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,959
or what does the word make you think of

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,040
when you first hear the word semantics

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
and you might want to think about

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
logical and lexical

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
semantics any thoughts there sasha

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
um yeah i think this is uh kind of the

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
getting into the confusing theme of the

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
paper where you have to be extremely

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,959
specific with the language that

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
you use and so to me semantics means

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,160
um how we use words

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
and how we make meaning

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
okay very nice and the way that we use

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,959
words

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
the meaning of words is often what

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
people mean by semantics like syntax is

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,879
how it's written

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,959
and then semantics uh or at least the

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,080
semantics of words

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,239
is about how the words are related to

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
each other and then also we have logical

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
semantics which is just purely

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
about logical statements and may or may

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
not have any word

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
representation behind it so there's that

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,280
word

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
representation and this is definitely

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
one of the key words of the paper

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
so maybe yvonne what do you think about

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
or what does a representation mean to

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
you

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,239
to me as we can say yeah as

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
as we as we are saying

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,159
we actually represent in our mind

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,230
different uh

92
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,440
[Music]

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
different things behind different

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
conceptions

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
so it's always

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
hard to understand not always but

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
usually have to understand what people

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
saying when

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
when they use one or

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,080
another concept yep

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
and that vagueness about the term

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,599
representation

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
is really one of the things that the

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
paper sets out to clarify

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,959
because a lot of times people will use

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
the word representation

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
assuming that one must exist oh if

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,599
you're thinking of

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
elephants there must be some neural

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
state in your head that represents an

111
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,199
elephant otherwise how could you be

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,680
thinking about an elephant um and then

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
this paper is going to really drill down

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
what is the relationship between that

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
conception and the neural representation

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
um next question what is intentionality

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
who or what has it so just kind of off

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
the cuff because of course this is a big

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
topic but what does intentionality mean

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
or who gets to have intentionality

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
either of you

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,760
i think intention

123
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,320
[Music]

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,719
is

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
became when

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
when someone wanted wanted to do

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,039
something

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,120
yes intention it about the future so

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,880
i will do it in the future

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
any thoughts there um

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
yeah another wonderfully vague word and

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
um we often talk about

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,759
uh in interpreting other people's

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,400
actions

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,120
whether or not we can infer their intent

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,520
and

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,320
of course that gets quite messy but

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
with how vague the word is you could say

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
that everything has intention

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,360
because it um

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
you know even a rock knows that it will

142
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
continue to stay a rock

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
in its uh sort of thermodynamic

144
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
landscape

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,759
very nice um and this is sort of that

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,800
pan psychist

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
twist which is do physical objects have

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
intention or what about criminal intent

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
do humans have intention or

150
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
how would we even know and then

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,479
how are narratives related to semantics

152
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,000
and then i'll just throw on the last one

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
there are narratives real

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,840
or in what sense are narratives real

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
any thoughts yvonne or we can move on

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
it's it's

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
really it's really hard philosophical

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,639
questions about are narratives real or

159
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
not

160
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
agreed i mean this is really and it's

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
why it's the last question before we

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,639
jump into the paper because

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,199
narratives are real like harry potter is

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,160
real it's really

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
a narrative but then of course you go

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
into it a little bit deeper and if

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
everybody has their own interpretation

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,319
of the narrative

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
well it's real but everyone has a

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,360
different reality

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
and then is that real well that's kind

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,039
of what we want to explore

173
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
and yes it's a different tool than

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,400
people expect

175
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
the usual tools that people would expect

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
to discuss these topics would be

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
very qualitative and wordy philosophy

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
arguments

179
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
and this is going to be a pretty totally

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,759
different approach

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,080
involving the free energy principle so

182
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,199
here we go

183
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
the paper that we're discussing today is

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
a recently accepted paper

185
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
from the journal of entropy but we're

186
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
reading off of the version that we found

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,280
on researchgate

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
and the paper is called is the free

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
energy principle a formal theory of

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,160
semantics

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
from variational density dynamics to

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
neural and phenotypic representations

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,199
so a lot of new words and for some

194
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
people this is going to

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
wrangle them because they think it's a

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
philosophical word being used improperly

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
other people they might not have clarity

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
on what all the words mean

199
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
so what we're going to do is look at the

200
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
big questions of the paper which are

201
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
thankfully the first two sentences of

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
the abstract and then we're going to run

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,840
through the rest of the abstract before

204
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
we go on to the rest of the paper

205
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
so kind of just like you're reading this

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
at home this is how we're going to

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,479
unpack the paper from the beginning to

208
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,680
the end

209
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
so there's two big questions and again

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
these are the first two sentences of the

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
abstract

212
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
their first question or their first uh

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
big goal

214
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
is to assess whether the construct of

215
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,080
neural representations

216
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
plays an explanatory role under the

217
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
variational free energy principle and

218
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
its corollary process theory active

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,479
inference

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,560
so there's a lot happening here i would

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
kind of jump into the middle

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
and it's where you start with a free

223
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
energy principle as a principle

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
meaning it's a paradigmatic it's

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,639
axiomatic it's foundational

226
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
and then there's a corollary which means

227
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
like a subsidiary or a secondary theory

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
and the secondary theory happens to be a

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,280
process theory

230
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
which means it's not a state theory it's

231
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
not about how things are it's about how

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,760
they relate

233
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
so another example of a process theory

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,240
would be evolution by natural selection

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
it doesn't tell you what state the

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,599
system is going to be in but it tells

237
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:43,839
you

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,000
if certain characteristics are present

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
in the system like replicators with

240
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
differential success and heritability

241
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
you're going to end up with this process

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
playing out so the process is active

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
inference and the paradigm is the free

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
energy principle

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
and then the question that they're going

246
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
to work on

247
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,519
is to assess whether the construct of

248
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,959
neural representations

249
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,160
so neural states whether those

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
have an explanatory role or are going to

251
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,839
enrich us

252
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,760
when we're thinking about free energy

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
principle active inference

254
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
and their second question that's tied to

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
the first is

256
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
if there is an explanatory role for

257
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
neural representations under active

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
inference and the free energy principle

259
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,600
which

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
we think that there will be then they're

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
going to assess

262
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
which philosophical stances in

263
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
relationship to ontological and

264
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
epistemological statuses of

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
representations is most appropriate

266
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,399
so they're going to use active inference

267
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,519
free energy principle

268
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,680
to explore how neural representations

269
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,519
are related to the real world

270
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
and then they're going to try to

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
translate that back to the classical

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
vocabulary and some of the classical

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,920
theories from philosophy

274
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
okay so let's continue going through the

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,959
abstract and this is definitely where

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,240
we're going to want to slow down and

277
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
make sure that we understand

278
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
what each of these terms mean from a

279
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
philosophical perspective what are the

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,519
baggage what are the assumptions what

281
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,959
are the implications

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
so they're going to focus on non-realist

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
which are deflationary and fictionalist

284
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
instrumentalist approaches

285
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
and they define it in the next sentence

286
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
a little bit so we don't need to dwell

287
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,480
there

288
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
we consider a deflationary account of

289
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,079
mental representation

290
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,320
according to which the explanatory

291
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,760
relevant contents of neural

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,240
representations are mathematical rather

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
than cognitive

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
so that's one type of account of

295
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
representation they're gonna pursue

296
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,839
the second type of representation that

297
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,360
they're gonna pursue

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
is this fictionalist or instrumentalist

299
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
account

300
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,160
in this view or this account the

301
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
representations are scientifically

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
useful fictions that

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
serve explanatory and other aims so

304
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
looking at this deflationary account in

305
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
the middle

306
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
and then the fictionalist

307
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
instrumentalist account at the bottom

308
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
what does that make either of you two

309
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,360
think about or how do

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
those two ideas differentiate themselves

311
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
or what would be another way that you

312
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
would restate either the middle one or

313
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,279
the bottom one

314
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,959
um i kind of struggle with

315
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
really specifically understanding what

316
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,160
the deflationary account

317
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
means and how it differs because

318
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
i kind of imagine that something could

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,839
be a mathematical representation as well

320
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,920
as a useful story

321
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
but

322
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,959
i think this is a common theme that

323
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
we'll be coming back to

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,600
um for this whole paper is that

325
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
um using active active inference um as a

326
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
framework it's not just a hypothesis

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,160
it's a lens that you apply um

328
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
to how you view things and so um viewing

329
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,639
things through

330
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
the active inference lens it seems like

331
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
these can all coexist in a way that's

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,000
not

333
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,680
exclusionary okay very nice yvonne

334
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
let me pass now okay i think that you

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,040
really

336
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
um said it well sasha which is that

337
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,800
um from a different lens the non-free

338
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
energy principle lens

339
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,760
these two viewpoints might be uh very

340
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
opposed to each other i'm just thinking

341
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,839
at some you know psychology conference

342
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,519
first someone says i propose a

343
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
deflationary account according to which

344
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
dot dot and the next person says

345
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,959
i propose a fictionalist account dot dot

346
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,600
dot but free energy is this new

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
lens and this new way of trying to

348
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
approach these classical

349
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
philosophical problems and the goal

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
would be that we could get

351
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
the best parts of both of them and use

352
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
them under the free energy principle

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,360
so from the deflationary account we

354
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,839
could

355
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
make mathematical representations of

356
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,959
neural

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
states that would be awesome and then

358
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
using a fictionalist or instrumentalist

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
accounts

360
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
maybe we could also have those

361
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
mathematical states be useful

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
so we kind of have like this this triad

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
we have neural states

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
i mean the neurons are definitely doing

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,600
something we don't know what but they're

366
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,639
doing something

367
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
then we have mathematical uh inference

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
which

369
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
what whatever the neurons are doing you

370
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
can always mathematically represent it

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
and then there's utility for the

372
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,880
scientist and or for the organism itself

373
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,839
and it's like you can choose one two or

374
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,639
three of them

375
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
and the goal would be we'd want all of

376
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,639
them to be under a common framework

377
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,320
so that's really where they're going

378
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
with this approach is instead of just

379
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
butting heads

380
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
oh well this part of the triangle is

381
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
better than this part of the triangle

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
they're going to see if free energy can

383
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
integrate across these different

384
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
perspectives

385
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
so the abstract's a little long here's

386
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
the second part

387
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
after reviewing the free energy

388
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
principle and active inference

389
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,079
we argue that a model of adaptive

390
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,760
phenotypes under the free energy

391
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,399
principle

392
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,839
can be used to furnish a formal

393
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,800
semantics enabling us to assign semantic

394
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
content to specific

395
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
phenotypic states which are the internal

396
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
states of a markovian system that exists

397
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
far from equilibrium so phenotype is

398
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
being used here quite broadly

399
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,199
a lot of times people think about

400
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
phenotype as measurable components of an

401
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,480
organism

402
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
and that's like oh well leg length is a

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,760
phenotype or hair

404
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
color is a phenotype and they are but

405
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,880
also

406
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,519
the instantaneous representation of the

407
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,000
neural

408
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,959
uh system is like a phenotype and so

409
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,480
just like a phenotype could be

410
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
reaction time another type of phenotype

411
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,600
could be

412
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
when i play a 200 hertz hone tone

413
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
into your ear your brain state in

414
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
response to that tone

415
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,880
is a phenotype so here phenotype is just

416
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,440
meaning

417
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
measurable components of a biological

418
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,279
system whether you actually measured

419
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
them or not

420
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
and then um they're going to ask

421
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
whether they can assign semantic content

422
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,040
so

423
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,760
that's meaningful content either lexical

424
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
semantics which is how words are related

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
or logical semantics which is how

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
ideas and propositions are related and

427
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,360
they're going to ask

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,880
whether they can make some sort of a

429
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,399
mapping between

430
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
semantics and phenotypic states within a

431
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,600
markovian system

432
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
and by markovian system far from

433
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
equilibrium they're highlighting

434
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
two pieces to call the system markovium

435
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
means that it can be bounded within a

436
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,320
markov blanket

437
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
which is to say that there are states

438
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
that are internal to the system

439
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
and states that are external to the

440
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
system and then the boundary nodes

441
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
um where when you're inside looking out

442
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
it's what you see or outside looking in

443
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,000
is what you see and that's this markov

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
blanket idea that we kind of come back

445
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,160
to in a lot of our discussions

446
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
they're going to propose and this is why

447
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
i made this font big a modified

448
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
fictionalist account in

449
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,560
organism-centered fictionalism or

450
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,120
instrumentalism so they're going to say

451
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,600
um

452
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
let's be pragmatic let's make a modified

453
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,600
account

454
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
where the organism is in its own

455
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,880
generative model

456
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
making an instrumental fiction about the

457
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,000
world

458
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,320
where uh i'm not exactly sure all the

459
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
connotations of instrumentalism here

460
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
but it's kind of like the body is an

461
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
instrument and then the song that's

462
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,480
being played

463
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
is the niche um is the fitness of the

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
organism's phenotype

465
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
to the challenges of its niche

466
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,880
they argue that under the free energy

467
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
principle pursuing even a deflationary

468
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,480
account

469
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,639
of the content of neural representations

470
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,000
licenses the appeal

471
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
to the kind of semantic content involved

472
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
in the aboutness or intentionality of

473
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
cognitive systems

474
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
our position is thus coherent with but

475
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
rests on distinct assumptions from

476
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,360
the realist position and so here we get

477
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,920
another

478
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
peek at the difference potentially

479
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,399
between the deflationary accounts and

480
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
the inflationary accounts

481
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,639
which is not really used but what does

482
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,759
it mean to deflate

483
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,440
or inflate in this context deflationary

484
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
it's like if somebody said oh it's just

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
a party it's a deflationary account of

486
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
the party it's like it's nothing big

487
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
okay whereas the inflationary account of

488
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,400
the party

489
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
would be like this is going to be the

490
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
most important party ever

491
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
it's going to be so important that all

492
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
these things happen in this really

493
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
symbolic way

494
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
and so the deflationary account of

495
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
neuroscience is it's

496
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
just what the brain is doing it's just

497
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
cells that are linked up to each other

498
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,240
and it's just time is passing and click

499
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,799
by click

500
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,000
in time it's just the physical system

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
but then you get into a little bit of a

502
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
bind when you want to reintroduce

503
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
semantics because if you just have this

504
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
massive agent-based model or dynamical

505
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,679
model

506
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
that's just being simulated forward

507
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
through time then

508
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
you can say um well it's as if it's

509
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
thinking about

510
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
elephants but you're never going to be

511
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
able to go back to the micro state and

512
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,559
say this is elephant

513
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
in the microstate as it's represented

514
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
because it's deflationary you kind of

515
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
deflated the meaning away

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,520
and um that's the realist position um

517
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
whereas this semantic is an inflationary

518
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
account it's like yes

519
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
it's a brain state but it actually is

520
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
meaning something more

521
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,799
and so that's what they're going to try

522
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
to take the best of both worlds they

523
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,840
want to have a formal

524
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,600
semantic system um like philosophy does

525
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
formal semantics but they want to ground

526
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
this formal semantics in how it arises

527
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
from phenotypic representation

528
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
specifically neural states

529
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
and then this is their closing argument

530
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
that we argue that the free energy

531
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,880
principle

532
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
thereby explains the aboutness or

533
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
intentionality in living systems

534
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
and hence their capacity to parse their

535
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
sensory streams using an ontology or

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
set of semantic factors and so here is

537
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
where they kind of

538
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
uh reach their synthesis and their

539
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
proposal

540
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
which is that if we can find some sort

541
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
of a bridge

542
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,440
between realism like what the brain is

543
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
actually doing

544
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
without any extra fluff just phenotype

545
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,520
and a formal semantic theory potentially

546
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,400
this will light the path forward for

547
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
understanding how

548
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
organisms parse their sensory data

549
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,799
coming in

550
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
into meaningful categories so instead of

551
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,160
just saying

552
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,080
well the photons hit my retina and

553
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
within a predictive processing framework

554
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760
my priors are updated and

555
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
yep there's sasha in the window and

556
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
there's evon in the window instead of

557
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
that type of

558
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,200
processing forward it's actually like we

559
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
get to think about

560
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
philosophically what the organism is

561
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
doing through parsing its sensory stream

562
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
but also retain the realism of the

563
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,440
sensory stream okay

564
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
any thoughts on that relatively long

565
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
abstract

566
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
it's more clear now okay that's the only

567
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,960
hope

568
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,440
if we aren't i would say the same good

569
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
if we're not reducing our uncertainty

570
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
about this paper

571
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
and their claims and their aims and

572
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
their goals then we're not really in it

573
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,559
so now that we have a little bit of a

574
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,600
better sense of

575
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,679
where they want to come from and where

576
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,039
they want to go to

577
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
let's look at the roadmap this is going

578
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
to be the path that we take

579
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
from the introduction of the problem and

580
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,159
its relevance

581
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,880
through the foundations to the claims

582
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
that are synthetic

583
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
so they're going to begin in the

584
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
introduction by talking about the idea

585
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
of neural representation

586
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
and the contents of neural

587
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
representation as well as a little bit

588
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,559
of a joke the dis

589
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
contents like dis discontented means to

590
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,080
be unhappy

591
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,840
so there's some issues with neural

592
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,080
representations um

593
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,600
and they're going to be discontent with

594
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
them by talking about the problems with

595
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
their contents

596
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,799
so classical joke the faces of

597
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,200
representationalism

598
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
realism and non-realism and so here is

599
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,280
those two different

600
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
dueling perspectives on representing and

601
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
it's another joke it's two faces

602
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
two faces of the same coin so if you're

603
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
gonna have representation

604
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
um it's kind of sitting just like a coin

605
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
on its edge

606
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
on one face it's the semantics what does

607
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,400
the

608
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
representation mean you're thinking of

609
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
an elephant it means elephant

610
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
and then there's the deflationary oh

611
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
it's just a neural state

612
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
and there's actually no meaning attached

613
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
to it even though it is a representation

614
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
of an elephant

615
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
then they're going to take a turn

616
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
towards anti-realism

617
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
they're going to talk about some of the

618
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
deficiencies of the realist view

619
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
and there's a lot of sort of ways to

620
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,320
approach this we'll look at the

621
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
specifics

622
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
but one example that i always come back

623
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,559
to is like

624
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
most people don't perceive their blind

625
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
spot or

626
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,880
they perceive that they have color

627
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
vision in their whole field of vision

628
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
and so yes the world really does have

629
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
wavelengths of different colors

630
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
coming from all over our visual field

631
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,799
but that's not

632
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
really what you're perceiving in your

633
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
retina so it

634
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,159
really is being generated by your brain

635
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,080
so it's really an organism's centered

636
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
fiction

637
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,919
which is why they're going to come back

638
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
to that idea later then they're going to

639
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,960
address

640
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
how representations are discussed

641
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
under the free energy principle as a

642
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
paradigm the second section

643
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
is where they turn more heartily to the

644
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
free energy principle

645
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
and they talk about active inference

646
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
again as a corollary process theory

647
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
to the free energy principle as a

648
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
paradigm and then specifically

649
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
they're going to bridge two topics here

650
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
they're going to move

651
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,919
from information geometry to the physics

652
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,280
of phenotypes

653
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,159
those might be two very new terms or two

654
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:26,559
way

655
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,200
new ways of thinking about information

656
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
and geometry a lot of times people think

657
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,799
about information theory is one type of

658
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,320
science and then geometry you know

659
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
triangles and squares

660
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
it's different so what is information

661
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,200
geometry

662
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,159
and then how is it related to not just

663
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,039
phenotype but the physics of phenotype

664
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,760
so first they go through state spaces

665
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
non-equilibrium dynamics and bears

666
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
oh my again hilarious writing

667
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,200
they're going to talk about markov

668
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
blankets and the dynamics of living

669
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,840
systems

670
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
so again a markov blanket is like this

671
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,760
set of nodes you can think of around a

672
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,480
system

673
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,159
that is the ideal perfect clean cut

674
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,000
carving up nature at the joint between

675
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
the internal and the external system

676
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
and going into the internal system is

677
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,679
sense data

678
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,840
and leaving the internal states are

679
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,960
action states

680
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,600
so we'll look more through that soon

681
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
then they're going to return to

682
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
information geometry and the physics

683
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
of not just phenotype but sentient

684
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,159
systems

685
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,919
and that's going to have to do with that

686
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,520
far from equilibrium nature

687
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,400
of living systems and it's why the rock

688
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
is uh not the person the object

689
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,400
is not alive but a person uh who has

690
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,080
far from equilibrium thermodynamic

691
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
states they're considered to be

692
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
living then they talk about phenotype as

693
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
a tale of two

694
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,919
den cities again trying to loop as many

695
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
puns as possible into their titles and

696
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
then they close out section two

697
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
with the discussion of living models

698
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
which is a mechanistic view

699
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,480
on goal directed probabilistic inference

700
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
and decision making under the free

701
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
energy principle

702
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,520
so everything is under the free energy

703
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
principle because that's

704
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
um our working model and then here

705
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
they're going to try to go from a

706
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,919
mechanistic

707
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,679
view so they want to talk about the

708
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
mechanisms which are how things are

709
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,000
actually

710
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,640
happening but they also want to include

711
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
some things that are not traditionally

712
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
included in mechanism

713
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,240
for example goal directedness

714
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,679
probabilistic inference

715
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,200
and even decision making then in section

716
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,600
3

717
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
is where they uh bring together their

718
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
deflationary and fictionalist account of

719
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
neural representation

720
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
first they're going to propose their

721
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
deflationary account to neural

722
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,679
representation

723
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
in the other words brains are just doing

724
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,720
brain stuff nothing more

725
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,440
nothing less that's what fristen calls

726
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,480
deflationary

727
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,559
um in a sense don't don't inflate your

728
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,000
hopes that there's going to be some

729
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,960
magical

730
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
secret you know between the neurons in

731
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
the brain the brain

732
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
is just doing brain stuff and it's

733
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,000
tremendously complex and it involves

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
multiple cell types

735
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,679
but it's just that nothing more and

736
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,200
nothing less

737
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,799
then they're going to talk about

738
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
fictionalism and how models come into

739
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,000
play

740
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,960
in scientific practice and then in the

741
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,400
closing section four

742
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
they're going to finally reach their

743
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,559
synthesis which is a variational

744
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,720
semantics from generate generative

745
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
models to deflated

746
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,720
semantic content so now they're going to

747
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
try to deflate meaning

748
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
itself so when i say that my name is

749
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
daniel and there's so many layers to

750
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,720
interpret that on

751
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
it's a string of audio bits now it's a

752
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,640
string of audio bits that is being

753
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,159
transmitted through the computer

754
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,559
through the live stream it's just

755
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,600
exactly what i mean

756
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,159
it's just the signal i'm sending nothing

757
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,600
more and nothing less

758
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
so how are we going to get this kind of

759
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
deflationary realism about the world

760
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,559
that's so critical for an unbiased or at

761
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,679
least transparent

762
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
scientific approach we want that

763
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,039
unbiasedness

764
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,080
that objectiveness yet because

765
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
we're semantic entities we know that

766
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
we're going to have to engage with the

767
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,919
world

768
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,760
in terms of meaning so how are we going

769
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200
to square this circle with

770
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
realism and what is just there with

771
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,559
meaning and all the power that meaning

772
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
based approaches can bring to the table

773
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
then they're going to um yeah provide

774
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
the deflationary account of content

775
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
under the free energy principle and move

776
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,799
from

777
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,840
a computational theory that is proper to

778
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
a formal semantics

779
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,679
and then they're going to close out with

780
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
the idea of phenotypic representations

781
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
and ontologies

782
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,039
okay big road map a lot of stops a lot

783
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
of gas stations a lot of restaurants

784
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
any thoughts on that

785
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,000
okay good sasha

786
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
all right yeah that was really helpful

787
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,039
um

788
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
to talk through the the road map and um

789
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,960
see where we end up okay

790
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
so sorry for the wall of text but i

791
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,799
wanted to

792
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
put one of their key claims verbatim

793
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
they write and this is a

794
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
pretty early on in the paper i think

795
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,720
this is on the bottom of page

796
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
uh the actual paper

797
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,880
uh page uh three or four yeah bottom of

798
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
page three in the

799
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
pdf but the page numbers could be

800
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
different for a future version

801
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
they write there are several well

802
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,440
accepted constraints for the

803
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
appropriateness

804
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
of representational explanations so

805
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
we're talking about

806
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,799
representations and now we want to think

807
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,760
what are the

808
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,399
desirada what do we want what would be a

809
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
great theory of representation

810
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,399
and they're going to play by the rules

811
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,320
of people who study representation

812
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,679
they're going to say these are the

813
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,960
community of people who study

814
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
representation they've decided that

815
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,520
these are like

816
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,480
the five rubrics if you can ace all five

817
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
of these tests

818
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,039
then you're going to get an a plus for

819
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,520
your theory so first it should cohere

820
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,240
broadly

821
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,399
with actual practices that are used in

822
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,000
computational cognitive science

823
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,480
research so that means if you have some

824
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
theory of representation that only

825
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,080
applies on a different planet or outside

826
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,440
of an fmri machine

827
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
you're probably not going to get too far

828
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
we want this representation model

829
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
to be grounded with the real things that

830
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,399
people are doing

831
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,799
in computational cognitive science and

832
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,480
also psychiatry

833
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,000
um two we want to allow for

834
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
misrepresentation

835
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
which means that the representation has

836
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,279
to be able to get it wrong

837
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,880
and so if you say think of an elephant

838
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
and then anything that the person thinks

839
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,159
of you're going to say right well that's

840
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
what they their version of elephant is

841
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,679
they started thinking about lunch

842
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
but they can't be wrong because no

843
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,240
representation is incorrect

844
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
that's not going to be super useful we

845
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
won't be able to actually parse the

846
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,399
world

847
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
into like useful pieces of information

848
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
and not useful

849
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,919
um and that's a lot like saying if you

850
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,960
can't um

851
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,679
if you can't have a model that gives you

852
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,960
the wrong answer it can't give you the

853
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
right answer you know if it just gives

854
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,039
you a one

855
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,120
no matter what you put into it it's not

856
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,679
useful just because it might be right

857
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,760
twice a day like a broken clock doesn't

858
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,919
mean that it's actually a useful model

859
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
three representation should provide the

860
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
principled method

861
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,960
for attributing determinate contents to

862
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
specific states or structures

863
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,279
internal to the system um so we're

864
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,520
looking for some sort of a bridge

865
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,919
for a way that we can uh go from a

866
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,279
specific brain state

867
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
like your amygdala is having a lot of

868
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,279
blood flow and your prefrontal cortex

869
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,440
isn't that would be a very coarse level

870
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799
representation

871
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,919
or uh you could imagine a a one million

872
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
dimensional representation

873
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,200
this neuron is doing that and this glia

874
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
is doing that we want to go from

875
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,640
that uh specific state representation

876
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,559
which might look like a vector or some

877
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,960
other map and we want to go from there

878
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
to something that is internal and or

879
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
external to the system like

880
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
thirsty or hungry or thinking of an

881
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,640
elephant

882
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,080
finally four we want this representation

883
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,200
theory to be naturalistic meaning that

884
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,520
the account of semantic content does not

885
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,840
itself appeal to semantic terms

886
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
when defining how the representational

887
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,880
capacity

888
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
is realized by the physical system on

889
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,240
pain of circularity and reasoning now um

890
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,919
pretty rich for the free energy

891
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,840
principle to call someone else

892
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,600
out on the circularity of reasoning and

893
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,880
it's uh it's a complex claim to parse

894
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
what is being said with number four

895
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,159
because

896
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
in some deep sense because our um

897
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,919
axioms are chosen without evidence by

898
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,880
definition

899
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,279
our paradigms uh are non-explanatory

900
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
they can't be explained

901
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
uh the question of what's a circular

902
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,120
reasoning argument and what isn't

903
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,159
um is is not perfectly well defined but

904
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,240
i think what they're getting for uh

905
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
getting out with number four

906
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,960
is like we want the semantic content

907
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,600
of the elephant to be an elephant not

908
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,039
just the word elephant

909
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,399
we don't want to enter into this

910
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,240
infinite recursion where like

911
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
language explains language and then that

912
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
explains another kind of language

913
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
and we just stay within this realm of

914
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
abstracted uh

915
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,840
representations but we never actually

916
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,799
come back

917
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,919
even in a uh sort of unexpected way

918
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,399
to the reality of the naturalistic

919
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,360
situation

920
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,000
which is as evolved entities we actually

921
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
have evolved to represent certain

922
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
external patterns

923
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,799
internally and so if it doesn't come

924
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,480
back to that naturalism

925
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,200
then it's just gonna fly off into space

926
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,679
any

927
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,080
thoughts on this uh four claims about

928
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
what would make a good representational

929
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,840
theory

930
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
um i found that last statement quite uh

931
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,320
iron ironic and circular um because in a

932
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,480
way we're always using semantics to

933
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,679
describe the systems that um

934
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,760
are semantic but also maybe eventually

935
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
linked to

936
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,640
a natural state or uh you know a real

937
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
elephant

938
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,720
if you will um and i

939
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
i think uh yeah this paragraph was the

940
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,320
most helpful in trying to

941
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,480
parse out the kind of um

942
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,960
uh things that they're looking for and

943
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
the arguments that they're trying to

944
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,880
make

945
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,159
and um i really i think

946
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,320
part two is quite interesting and then

947
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
they do get into it later in the paper

948
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,559
but

949
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,559
um to me that's always the most

950
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,240
interesting part of the free energy

951
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,200
principle to address

952
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,440
cool and here just to put it up on the

953
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
screen one more time

954
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,480
this is from page four in the uh

955
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
accepted manuscript version where they

956
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
uh return to the two-fold aim of the

957
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,440
paper

958
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,840
which is to determine whether or not

959
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,600
neural representations

960
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,799
are going to play an explanatory role

961
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,279
or any role at all within this

962
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,960
increasingly popular

963
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
framework for the study of action and

964
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
cognition

965
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,159
the variational free energy principle

966
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,279
and then second

967
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,679
they want to postulate whether the

968
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,679
neural representation theory

969
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,120
is gonna be warranted under the

970
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,279
principle so this is related to those uh

971
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,080
first two

972
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
things that we put up on the screen the

973
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,600
first two sentences the abstract the big

974
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,480
questions

975
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,919
okay so let's jump into the figures and

976
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,720
then we're gonna

977
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,279
work our way down the paper and sort of

978
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,080
landmark

979
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
at the different figures so that um

980
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
we're understanding how they're visually

981
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000
as well as conceptually representing

982
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
these different topics along the roadmap

983
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
and then at any point if you have a

984
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,799
question

985
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,440
about the figure or the text

986
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,159
specifically

987
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,159
or just a related thought that comes to

988
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,880
mind just bring it up

989
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
so the first figure and the caption is

990
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,080
copied below

991
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,000
so you can okay

992
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,799
is a markov blanket and this is very

993
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,360
similar

994
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,399
to other images that we've seen

995
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,919
but this is just a foundational term for

996
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
the free energy principle is this idea

997
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,760
of a markov blanket

998
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
so we've talked about markov blankets

999
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
before maybe would either of you like to

1000
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
give it a shot at what a markov blanket

1001
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
might mean or

1002
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,199
not just the total definition but even

1003
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,199
just one aspect of it that you think is

1004
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,960
interesting or relevant to remember

1005
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
right now

1006
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,359
okay let me try once have

1007
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,159
its integral internal states and

1008
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,839
sensation and action and

1009
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,879
also in

1010
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,280
in space around there is

1011
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,199
external states that one

1012
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,440
doesn't know about and doesn't know

1013
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,560
how uh

1014
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,000
how it will

1015
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,160
impact on its its

1016
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,520
own internal state yes there is a border

1017
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,130
that

1018
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,119
[Music]

1019
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,000
where external states it's out of the

1020
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,640
border and

1021
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
internal states and the actions and

1022
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
sensation is

1023
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
in it perfect so here the purple node

1024
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,640
mew

1025
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,839
is the uh system of interest this is the

1026
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,160
project in focus this is like the

1027
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,240
internal state

1028
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
and then the blanket actually goes one

1029
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
layer out

1030
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,839
from the internal states and it goes in

1031
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,680
two different directions this blanket

1032
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,960
extends it extends upstream

1033
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,119
towards the green s's those are the

1034
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,160
sensory states

1035
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,680
that are coming in to the internal state

1036
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,760
through these hidden external causes the

1037
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
orange nodes

1038
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,160
and then leaving the markov blanket

1039
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,200
are these a action states and action

1040
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,839
states

1041
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,200
um are basically resulting from the

1042
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,079
internal states dynamics as well as

1043
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,480
other

1044
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
sensory causes so here that s on the

1045
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,680
left side

1046
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,640
is just going directly to action so when

1047
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,599
i was thinking

1048
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,599
what does it look like for the sense to

1049
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,280
enter the markov blanket

1050
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
but not enter the model i was thinking

1051
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,800
of like um

1052
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
you know having uh like a splint on the

1053
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,320
arm

1054
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,359
it's like the overall outcome action

1055
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
moving your arm it's going to be related

1056
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
to your internal states

1057
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,599
as well as some external influence that

1058
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,520
wasn't really part of you

1059
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,640
but it's part of your integrated unit of

1060
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
sense and action and so that

1061
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,040
that that external cause about the world

1062
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,960
having a constraint on your arm

1063
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,000
ends up changing your action states and

1064
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
therefore it makes sense to include

1065
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,640
its sensory input and action uh

1066
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,800
influencing ability within the markov

1067
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
blanket

1068
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,040
even though it's not within your

1069
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,280
epithelia and that is actually why

1070
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
there's such a natural transition

1071
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,680
from thinking about this type of markov

1072
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
blanket framework

1073
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,920
to thinking about extended cognition

1074
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,079
exocortex

1075
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
ecological cognition distributed

1076
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,720
cognition because it's the realization

1077
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
that even one person's internal states

1078
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
for example the brain

1079
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,119
are in feedback with external tools like

1080
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,079
the computer

1081
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,599
and so they're external from the point

1082
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,200
of view of the epithelium

1083
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,800
but actually from the perspective of the

1084
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,119
markov blanket they're internal to the

1085
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,839
same

1086
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,480
self-uh regulatory cybernetic system

1087
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
that's grasping

1088
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
at these external causes and trying to

1089
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
influence them

1090
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
so i'm going to return just to the paper

1091
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,480
so that we can scroll through

1092
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,839
and um see where this figure comes up to

1093
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,200
but i just wanted to get that first

1094
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
markov blanket in

1095
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,599
so here we are in this section 1.1

1096
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,800
with the realism and non-realism and so

1097
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
here's where they talk about realism

1098
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,920
about neural representation

1099
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,560
what is real finally we get to find out

1100
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,960
um

1101
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,119
this view combines two positions

1102
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,079
ontologically

1103
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,040
that neural representations really exist

1104
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,480
which means that they're physically

1105
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,839
something that's instantiated

1106
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,599
happening in the brain and then

1107
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,560
epistemologically

1108
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,119
that's how we come to know about things

1109
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,280
that representations are scientifically

1110
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,560
useful as well

1111
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,800
so realism they're saying has an

1112
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
ontological component which is that

1113
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,040
they're real

1114
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,200
they're actually physically instantiated

1115
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
and epistemological realism

1116
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,839
is that scientists should find this

1117
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,640
realism

1118
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,400
uh useful non-realist positions um

1119
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,280
which have not a complete overlap and

1120
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
that's a little bit of the confusion

1121
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,960
is it's not like the realists and the

1122
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
non-realists are totally opposed

1123
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
they do share some aspects of their

1124
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
models so it's not like

1125
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,560
perfectly everything that realism is

1126
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
non-realism isn't

1127
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,119
so what what does that mean non-realists

1128
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,359
are

1129
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,079
either agnostic about the reality of

1130
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,520
neural representation

1131
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
so that's kind of just like saying they

1132
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,839
don't care what's real in the brain or

1133
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,359
they'll never know or we couldn't

1134
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,200
measure it anyway there's a lot of ways

1135
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
you could be agnostic

1136
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,079
right about anything or they explicitly

1137
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,200
reject the assumption and so the

1138
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
non-realist is kind of like the agnostic

1139
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
the anti-realist is like the strong

1140
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,119
atheist

1141
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,839
they say neural representations do not

1142
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,720
exist

1143
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,320
so that's the strong claim is

1144
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
anti-realism or realism

1145
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,320
theism atheism and then non-realists are

1146
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,040
kind of like

1147
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,200
the utilitarian the agnostic in the

1148
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,079
middle

1149
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,079
and they continue talking through

1150
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,680
several of these different

1151
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,920
philosophical ideas or these schools of

1152
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,880
thought like

1153
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,839
eliminationism which is anti-realist and

1154
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,200
it's basically saying

1155
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
the construct should be eliminated so we

1156
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,119
shouldn't even use it

1157
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,119
and that reminds me of like the idea of

1158
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,200
a genotype phenotype map

1159
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,440
or a mapping some people say yes there

1160
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,359
is a map and we can find out about it

1161
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,320
other people say no there's no map but

1162
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,839
it's as if it exists

1163
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,079
so you can talk about it it's useful but

1164
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,040
it doesn't really

1165
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
exist and then there's other people who

1166
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
say you should eliminate the concept of

1167
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,720
a genotype phenotype map

1168
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
because it just is simply misleading to

1169
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280
scientists so that's eliminationism

1170
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,599
and then instrumentalism or fictionalism

1171
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,119
is non-realism and is saying that

1172
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,000
they're useful

1173
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
so that is hearkening back to the work

1174
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,359
of dennett

1175
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
for example with the intentional stance

1176
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
as well as a lot of other

1177
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,760
folks research um just

1178
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
speeding through this because there's a

1179
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
lot of sections they're going to talk

1180
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,880
about parallel distributed processing

1181
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,160
they're going to talk about some of the

1182
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,560
issues of realism

1183
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,000
um and we

1184
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
we're just gonna move through this

1185
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,359
because the specific critiques of

1186
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,400
realism um

1187
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,480
i feel like they're gonna end up moving

1188
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,839
beyond them so

1189
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,560
if you're curious you can read more into

1190
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,920
their specific

1191
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,480
problems with realism then they're going

1192
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,359
to return to

1193
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,960
representations under the free energy

1194
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
principle and that closes out section

1195
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,839
one

1196
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,119
so i think we could then go to um figure

1197
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,400
two to

1198
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,720
look at the free energy principle so

1199
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
here is where we

1200
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,760
get to figure two um

1201
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,560
and where figure two is conveying the

1202
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,040
basic

1203
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
outline of active inference in the free

1204
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,800
energy principle so would either of you

1205
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,119
two

1206
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,200
like to take a stab what do you see in

1207
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,119
this figure either on the left side or

1208
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,760
on the right side

1209
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,680
um sure i'll take a stab

1210
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,119
yeah so this is uh kind of taking that

1211
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,400
model of the marco blanket in figure one

1212
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
and um trying to uh

1213
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,640
fit it to some of the parameters of um

1214
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,599
an organism

1215
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,000
and you know with the image of a brain

1216
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
to remind us what we're doing here

1217
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,040
um and

1218
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,000
to explicitly say and mathematically say

1219
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,319
what

1220
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
external and internal states are

1221
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
representing

1222
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,000
and that they're linked by the sensory

1223
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,200
states

1224
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,400
and active states now sensory states

1225
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
are explicitly going into the internal

1226
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,680
states

1227
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,119
and active states are explicitly going

1228
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,720
out into the external states and so

1229
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,879
and then there's feedback between um

1230
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,640
some of the the components in this

1231
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,800
system

1232
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,839
very nice uh yvonne any thoughts on this

1233
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
uh as

1234
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,599
as was as was told

1235
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,440
at the start that we can

1236
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,119
we can have a mathematician

1237
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,720
mathematician expression of

1238
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,839
of the states and there is such

1239
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,760
expressions in math so

1240
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,800
if we have

1241
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,000
if we stay different well yes we can

1242
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,599
describe how

1243
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,319
we propose to

1244
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,960
have it in math yes

1245
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,359
it's also it's also has

1246
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,240
w with a little note down

1247
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,280
how it's letter called i don't know

1248
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,319
omega omega

1249
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,359
oh manga okay

1250
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,800
and yeah what is it that i just forget

1251
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,560
it's it's random noise yeah so that is

1252
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,319
kind of like a error term

1253
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,119
in each of these uh four so this is

1254
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,880
adding another level of complexity to

1255
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,839
this figure

1256
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,319
so here we had hidden external states

1257
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,280
that are orange

1258
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,599
sensory states coming in that are green

1259
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,200
purple internal states

1260
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,680
blue action states going out and then

1261
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
influence on those latent causes in the

1262
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,240
world

1263
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,520
in orange at the bottom now on the left

1264
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,240
side

1265
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,880
we have internal states with blue that's

1266
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,839
still the mu

1267
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,200
variable and it contains some internal

1268
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,920
function

1269
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,800
f of mu and b and so b is the blanket

1270
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,319
and it's basically saying

1271
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,839
um mu is going to be a function of

1272
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,880
mu and b so the state of the internal

1273
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,280
state

1274
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,319
is a function of itself and the blanket

1275
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,280
states

1276
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,920
and there's a noise term okay then we go

1277
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,200
to the active states

1278
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,400
active states are a function of mu and b

1279
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
they're a function of the internal state

1280
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,760
and

1281
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,319
the blanket states that makes sense plus

1282
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,520
another noise term

1283
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,960
and then you can continue working your

1284
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
way around and you can see that external

1285
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,079
states are a function of

1286
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,319
external states in the blanket plus a

1287
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,359
noise term

1288
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,599
and sensory states are a function of

1289
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,880
external states

1290
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,520
uh and the noise term external states

1291
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,640
and the blanket state

1292
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,280
plus a noise term so this gives us gives

1293
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,680
us

1294
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
a few nice partitionings first we can

1295
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,839
talk about

1296
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,920
uh doing inference on the variables that

1297
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,960
we care about

1298
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
by separating them away from a noise

1299
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
term and then also

1300
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,280
you can already see that sensory states

1301
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,319
don't rely

1302
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,920
on internal states or action states

1303
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,960
other than the ones that are in the

1304
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,359
blanket and so this type of partitioning

1305
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,480
is moving us

1306
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,119
towards a very clean way of talking

1307
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:29,599
about

1308
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,119
these different factors and how they

1309
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,680
influence each other

1310
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,839
let's do one more figure before we

1311
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,200
return to the paper

1312
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
so here is figure three this is going to

1313
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,720
be

1314
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,920
another representation of free energy

1315
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,640
principle

1316
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,440
active inference so here at the top of

1317
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,319
the figure

1318
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,920
we have this magical g expected free

1319
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,640
energy

1320
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,720
um and the expected free energy now

1321
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,040
we're like looking inside the brain

1322
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,839
uh that's the the inference organ that's

1323
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,680
calculating expected free energy which

1324
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,280
we'll come back to mathematically what

1325
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,240
it is

1326
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,040
and the brain or the internal state of

1327
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,000
the system

1328
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
guides policy selection pi for policy

1329
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,319
like a p

1330
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,280
and policy selection is intermediate

1331
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,920
between

1332
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,480
the model of the world and the actual

1333
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,839
action selection

1334
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,640
so for example if i see the ball coming

1335
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,760
out in front of me

1336
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,240
and my policy is that i'm gonna run and

1337
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
uh try to catch the ball

1338
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,480
it's like halfway between action which

1339
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,440
is actually

1340
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,359
the legs moving and running to catch the

1341
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,720
ball and

1342
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,359
the pure internal generative model which

1343
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,000
is like

1344
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,319
wow if i ran as fast as i could i could

1345
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,599
catch that ball

1346
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,800
in between is the policy choice and so

1347
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,640
that's what the brain is trying to

1348
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,000
converge upon

1349
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,640
good solutions for and that's why um

1350
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,920
free energy principle

1351
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,560
is adjacent to cybernetics control

1352
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,119
theory

1353
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,040
and a lot of other areas that actually

1354
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
are action oriented

1355
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
because in the end it's not just that we

1356
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,319
go from model

1357
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,440
to action it goes model to policy to

1358
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
realized action

1359
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,760
um and it's a nuance but it turns out to

1360
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,560
simplify

1361
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,359
the the uh the system and the model a

1362
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,240
lot

1363
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,280
then we have initial

1364
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,520
uh prior beliefs about the initial

1365
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,119
hidden states are in d

1366
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
so on the left side of the image and

1367
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
time is going from left to right here

1368
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,559
the left side is this r priors about the

1369
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,280
initial

1370
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,839
hidden state like um i think it's dark

1371
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,200
outside

1372
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,400
then um the actual hidden states are

1373
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,599
these ends

1374
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,720
these news i guess um and actual hidden

1375
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,839
states

1376
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,119
are going to move through

1377
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,400
a likelihood mapping a and result in

1378
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,000
sensory observation

1379
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,720
so initially in d i believe it's dark

1380
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,520
outside

1381
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
and let's just imagine that this n1 is

1382
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,280
actually dark

1383
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,960
so then there's a mapping where if it's

1384
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,720
dark no photons appear

1385
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,079
and if it's light there's a bunch of

1386
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,559
photons and then that results i don't

1387
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,520
know about n

1388
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,079
i don't know about a but i do know about

1389
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:08,559
s

1390
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,599
which is i don't get any photons so

1391
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,720
that's consistent with it being dark

1392
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,640
because there's a mapping between it

1393
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,400
being light and photons and it being

1394
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,079
dark and no photons

1395
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,800
um sometimes it seems like we're

1396
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,760
explaining things

1397
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,599
like multiple times and saying it the

1398
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,119
exact same way

1399
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,520
but it turns out that by observing um

1400
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,960
this structure here

1401
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,960
we can see how these beliefs change

1402
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,000
through time so

1403
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,920
then b are state transition

1404
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,119
probabilities

1405
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,839
and so then by observing the lack of

1406
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
photons in s1

1407
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,400
that is uh confirming my belief that

1408
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,520
it's dark outside

1409
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,280
and so we continue iterating through

1410
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,640
time where

1411
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,880
basically the probabilities of state

1412
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,839
transitions

1413
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,880
are happening about the external world

1414
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,200
and then the external world keeps on

1415
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,559
emitting

1416
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,960
sense data to us through this likelihood

1417
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,599
mapping

1418
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,280
and then what the internal state is

1419
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,240
doing is by minimizing free energy

1420
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,160
expected free energy across the whole

1421
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,400
thing we're gonna come to adaptive

1422
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,079
policy selection

1423
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,720
okay any thoughts on this sort of third

1424
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,160
representation of

1425
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,319
markov blankets slash free energy sash

1426
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,000
um yeah uh that was really uh useful to

1427
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,040
walk through because

1428
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,079
um i really wasn't sure how to uh

1429
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,680
which direction to approach this figure

1430
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,280
from um

1431
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,400
and uh the way you described it

1432
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,480
it just makes it very clear and reminds

1433
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,839
me a lot of um

1434
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,319
kind of experimental design where you go

1435
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,040
from

1436
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,119
one state uh

1437
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,160
one set of uh hidden states and then you

1438
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,119
observe something

1439
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
and then you change one variable and you

1440
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,400
observe something else

1441
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,240
but it really depends on what your

1442
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,599
understanding of the

1443
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,640
um kind of relationship between you know

1444
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
photons and darkness for example that

1445
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,240
helps you interpret

1446
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,280
your next observation um so

1447
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,400
i i think it just highlights that we're

1448
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,319
always doing that we're always trying to

1449
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,680
link um

1450
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,559
the observed state to what's causing it

1451
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,160
or

1452
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
kind of a hypothesis testing all the

1453
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,200
time

1454
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,680
yep and it this is a discrete model on

1455
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,520
the bottom it says um the form of this

1456
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,559
generative model

1457
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,359
is basically discrete but we could

1458
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,119
imagine it let's just flesh out that

1459
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,880
experimental metaphor

1460
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,559
so let's just say the initial hidden

1461
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,000
state is that

1462
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,119
a bacteria of interest is present or not

1463
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,200
in a sample so if it's present there's

1464
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,880
going to be dna corresponding to this

1465
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,280
bacteria if it's not there won't be dna

1466
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,079
that's the likelihood mapping a and so

1467
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,920
initially we don't know

1468
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,319
and so we do an experiment we perturb

1469
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,160
the system by adding some chemicals by

1470
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,000
doing a pcr reaction

1471
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,720
and then we get the sensory data output

1472
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,839
and it it's uh

1473
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,559
inclusive and then we we can update our

1474
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,440
policy

1475
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,720
until we get a sensory uh observation

1476
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,680
that's consistent with um what is

1477
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,280
happening inside the test tube

1478
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,200
and that's why we have positive and

1479
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,880
negative controls because if you just

1480
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,400
run one experiment

1481
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,359
then and you get a negative result well

1482
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,240
on one hand

1483
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,839
it might be that there's no bacteria

1484
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,440
there but also

1485
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,559
the likelihood mapping of uh makes it so

1486
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,240
that well there could be a bacteria but

1487
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,559
then it maps onto a negative result

1488
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,680
because the pcr didn't work and so

1489
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,440
that's what comes back to the mind of

1490
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,280
the scientist whereas

1491
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,079
the scientist has to look in a sense at

1492
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,359
the sensory data

1493
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,200
at the measurements empirically measured

1494
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,200
uh results but actually look

1495
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,160
beyond them to reduce uncertainty about

1496
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,960
something that's

1497
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,119
real like whether or not the bacteria

1498
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,319
are in that sample

1499
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,240
because it's not just did the test come

1500
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,839
back positive or negative

1501
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,760
that's going to be misleading because

1502
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,960
that makes it so that the

1503
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,680
s is the same as the hidden state but

1504
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,280
it's not the hidden state

1505
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,400
it's the outcome as mapped by a from the

1506
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,440
hidden state

1507
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,319
given your experimental setup all within

1508
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,400
a policy situation or an experimental

1509
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,599
research program

1510
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,599
that's dictated by minimization of

1511
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,640
expected free energy

1512
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,240
any thoughts on that yvonne or we'll

1513
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,118
jump back to the paper

1514
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,280
cool so um

1515
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,000
in section two let me just look at what

1516
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,720
the next

1517
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,839
figure is the next figure okay so

1518
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,680
we're gonna a few minutes we'll jump to

1519
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,280
the paper so

1520
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,319
um this is going to be an introduction

1521
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:38,640
to

1522
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,040
state spaces and non-equilibrium

1523
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,800
dynamics though i'm not quite sure where

1524
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,119
the bears come into play

1525
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,480
this is a key sentence living organisms

1526
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,280
maintain phenotypic integrity and resist

1527
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
the tendency towards thermodynamic

1528
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,640
equilibrium with their ambient

1529
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,839
surroundings

1530
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,400
full stop this is this is what it means

1531
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,359
to be alive

1532
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,880
this is schrodinger's 1944 what is life

1533
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,040
he says life is going to be locally

1534
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,119
thermodynamically organizational

1535
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,559
it's going to have negantropic

1536
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,160
characteristics it's going to locally

1537
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,440
organize

1538
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,920
matter and energy not violating the laws

1539
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,240
of physics because in the end the global

1540
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,720
system

1541
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,359
is disordered um but still the living

1542
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,880
system creates local order

1543
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,400
that's why you need to eat a few

1544
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,000
thousand calories of food

1545
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,280
to build one pound of muscle for example

1546
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
um and usually the fluctuation theorems

1547
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,240
that generalize the second law of

1548
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,599
thermodynamics

1549
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,079
would tend towards dissipation which is

1550
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,640
why

1551
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,119
uh things tend to break down unless

1552
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,880
they're being actively repaired and

1553
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,599
rejuvenated like living systems are

1554
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,760
living systems maintain their phenotypic

1555
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,680
integrity so they keep their leg at the

1556
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,599
same length or they keep their brain

1557
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,440
alive by bounding the entropy

1558
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,319
which is also the dispersion or spread

1559
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,160
of their constituent states

1560
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,400
and so it's like my arm exists in an

1561
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
organized state right now

1562
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
um where the bone is bone and the muscle

1563
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,079
is muscle and the fat is fat

1564
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,000
but you could imagine that if that were

1565
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,160
to break down so that just the carbons

1566
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,440
went floating free

1567
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,760
then the organism would cease to exist

1568
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,359
so organisms exist

1569
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,480
by virtue of and and by merit of

1570
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,960
maintaining their physical phenotypic

1571
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,160
representations

1572
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,839
coherent if it's not going to be a

1573
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,599
coherent phenotypic representation

1574
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,040
it's gone to get a better handle on this

1575
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,280
they introduced two formal notions the

1576
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,240
state space

1577
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,440
and non-equilibrium steady states so

1578
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,280
there's of course a lot that could be

1579
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
discussed about state space

1580
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,839
but a state space is a formalism that

1581
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,359
allows us to describe

1582
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,839
time evolution of a system by depicting

1583
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,000
a trajectory through state space

1584
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,240
so a physical state space could be like

1585
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,000
your latitude and longitude

1586
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,559
and then the state space trajectory is

1587
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,599
your path through

1588
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,079
latitude and longitude but also you

1589
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,839
could have a state space that has

1590
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,599
other axes that aren't latitude and

1591
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,280
longitude um

1592
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,160
that are for example neural state space

1593
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,520
and that's bringing us back to this

1594
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,839
question of neural representations

1595
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,720
um the probability density that

1596
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
describes the system

1597
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,960
at non-equilibrium steady states aka

1598
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,760
their phenotype

1599
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,079
states are aptly called non-equilibrium

1600
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,760
steady state density

1601
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,559
so my arm appears to be at an

1602
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,079
equilibrium in the sense that it's not

1603
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,599
growing or shrinking

1604
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,640
so why is that called non-equilibrium

1605
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,119
steady state well it's a steady state

1606
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,440
because in one respect the phenotype is

1607
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,400
unchanging

1608
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,280
but that unchangingness is actually an

1609
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,000
active

1610
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,240
compromise that's being reached between

1611
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,400
the forces of order and disorder and in

1612
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,000
that sense the total system

1613
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,480
is not in equilibrium the equilibrium

1614
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,839
system is the rock

1615
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,599
at the bottom of the hill that's the

1616
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,200
water you know when it's just at the

1617
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,319
bottom of the river

1618
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,119
there's nowhere to go from but when you

1619
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:57,920
have these

1620
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,640
two counter-regulatory processes of

1621
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,880
organization and disorganization

1622
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,280
you end up with this very dynamic uh

1623
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
location in state space that's always

1624
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,640
being re-optimized

1625
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,559
and the universe gives us the disorder

1626
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,160
for free that's easy

1627
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,240
it's easy to imagine how things fall

1628
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,880
apart but what life succeeds at doing is

1629
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,520
maintaining

1630
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,640
order even though there is disorder and

1631
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,119
then

1632
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,200
um this idea that there's a

1633
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,760
non-equilibrium steady state density

1634
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,920
is uh consistent with far from

1635
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,319
equilibrium thermodynamics and

1636
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,040
this is just related uh to again to

1637
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,119
schrodinger's question which is like

1638
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,520
the living systems have to maintain

1639
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,240
order

1640
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,040
somehow they have to maintain far from

1641
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,319
equilibrium states

1642
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,319
the equilibrium state is all of your

1643
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,480
carbons are unlinked and they're blasted

1644
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,799
off as co2 into the atmosphere

1645
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,720
so that's going to be the most well

1646
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,480
mixed thermodynamic state

1647
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,640
but we're not that we're phenotypically

1648
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,839
coherent so

1649
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,559
what are living systems and what allows

1650
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:58,960
them

1651
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
to stay organized despite that

1652
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,040
dissipative force

1653
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,040
that is where the markov blanket comes

1654
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,160
into play

1655
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,079
it turns out that by using the markov

1656
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,839
blanket formalism

1657
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,559
at first just as a scientific heuristic

1658
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,000
but we'll see it's actually deeper than

1659
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,799
that

1660
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,960
we can make clean distinctions between

1661
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,799
organismal internal states

1662
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
which are doing inference on the

1663
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,480
external states of the world

1664
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,079
active states which are the active

1665
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,799
states that actually move the organism

1666
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,079
uh actively into a better realm of state

1667
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:30,559
space

1668
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,240
like a better temperature for you to

1669
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,599
exist within

1670
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,720
um and then so we already talked about

1671
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,040
this

1672
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,640
partitioning but now we're thinking

1673
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,480
about this in terms of the internal

1674
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,280
states

1675
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,559
being far from equilibrium

1676
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,079
any thoughts or questions on that

1677
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,160
okay so here's where we're going to get

1678
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,599
to the information

1679
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,319
geometry as well as the physics of

1680
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,440
sentient systems

1681
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,079
so this is a big topic we're not going

1682
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:00,720
to have

1683
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,480
uh 50 hours to unpack it but this is why

1684
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
we're part of a journal club series

1685
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,160
because these are the ideas that we want

1686
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,280
to come back to

1687
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,839
again and again the description of a

1688
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,640
system

1689
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,200
the in terms of movements in internal

1690
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,319
phase space

1691
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,559
is the system's intrinsic information

1692
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,440
geometry

1693
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
closely related to measure theory and

1694
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,440
statistical thermodynamics

1695
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,400
so regular geometry would be in the

1696
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,720
phase space of the piece of paper

1697
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,040
you know x and y coordinates geometry is

1698
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,799
like a triangle has a certain

1699
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,720
shape and then you can imagine there's a

1700
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,400
different state space like

1701
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,319
non-euclidean geometry where the

1702
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,839
triangle has different rules

1703
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,000
but you can still talk about geometry

1704
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,160
and maybe even things like triangles

1705
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,839
but they don't necessarily need to

1706
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,920
correspond to the angles must

1707
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,559
sum to 180 because it's about the total

1708
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,240
systems representation

1709
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,920
about the rules of the system and about

1710
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,760
the geometry of the system and the state

1711
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,240
space

1712
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,640
the system exists within all those are

1713
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,920
really well linked

1714
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,359
so information geometry is asking

1715
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,400
about how we can do geometry not on

1716
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,400
x y on the piece of paper not on

1717
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
latitude longitude with a map

1718
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,599
but how could we do geometry on the

1719
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,520
informational internal states so

1720
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,839
it's a it's a big idea and there's a lot

1721
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,200
to it but

1722
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,359
what is that um what does that ring with

1723
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,160
either of you two

1724
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,119
and here's go ahead sasha um it's

1725
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,040
yeah it sounds like kind of a different

1726
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,640
way to phrase um

1727
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,599
like topology or mapping relationship

1728
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,119
between different

1729
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,720
um ideas or different people

1730
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,839
so thinking of like network uh

1731
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,839
analysis on these different concepts

1732
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,319
yep and here's that physical metaphor

1733
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,240
where in euclidean geometry

1734
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,400
if you move 100 meters then you'll move

1735
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,359
100 meters

1736
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,880
so there's a one-to-one relationship

1737
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,480
between the physical movement

1738
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,599
and the euclidean informational distance

1739
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,400
however if you're on a sphere if you

1740
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,040
move

1741
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,880
in the same direction you're gonna end

1742
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,119
up zero and so that's like kind of a

1743
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,760
modulus operation in mathematics

1744
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,079
and as opposed to saying well 10 plus 10

1745
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,200
equals 20.

1746
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,839
okay but what if you do modulus 10 then

1747
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,240
10

1748
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,520
goes to 0 and 20 goes to 0. so those

1749
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,319
numbers 0 10 and 20 are different in the

1750
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,400
number line in the euclidean world

1751
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,960
but there's another system another state

1752
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,480
space representation

1753
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,240
where actually 0 10 and 20 are

1754
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,960
the same point in that state space which

1755
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,319
is to say that their informational

1756
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,839
distance is zero

1757
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,599
another interesting thing about bringing

1758
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,760
it to the concept of information

1759
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,599
is that the informational divergence

1760
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,720
between two things is always positive

1761
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,880
so you can have um and that's kind of

1762
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,000
like um

1763
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,440
the distance between two things is

1764
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,680
always going to be a positive number

1765
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,880
um you could say um on this number line

1766
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,559
you know 10 minus 30 is negative 20 but

1767
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,079
if you have something on the 30 yard

1768
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,240
line in the 10 yard line of a football

1769
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,880
field

1770
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,200
the distance between them is positive so

1771
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,640
the number line is where we get things

1772
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,119
like

1773
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,400
negative numbers um but within very well

1774
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,760
specified systems

1775
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,000
information geometry also can tell us a

1776
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,200
lot more than uh

1777
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,319
other approaches here i don't think

1778
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,440
in this specific conversation we'll have

1779
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,640
too much time to go into the

1780
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,280
equations of information geometry where

1781
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,839
they use the fischer information metric

1782
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:38,079
as

1783
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,319
a sufficient statistic that corresponds

1784
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,440
to the expected

1785
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,240
thermodynamic and in external states and

1786
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,440
internal states

1787
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,559
um but this is let's put a flag here so

1788
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,160
that we know that we can come back to

1789
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,960
talk about this

1790
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,280
when we have some more colleagues on the

1791
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,039
conversation

1792
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,599
then they get to phenotype as a tale of

1793
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,880
these densities

1794
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,520
and they say that the phenotype is a

1795
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,280
free energy principle is a story about

1796
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,440
two probability densities

1797
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,760
the first is this non-equilibrium steady

1798
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,359
state density itself

1799
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,039
which is the statistical structure of

1800
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,799
the phenotype so that's that

1801
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,440
realist that's the deflationary realism

1802
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,559
and the second

1803
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,240
in the sense that this is the phenotype

1804
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,319
like your arm is a representation of the

1805
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,520
arm

1806
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,480
it's the uh it is itself the second is

1807
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,160
the variational density

1808
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,079
which is parameterized by the internal

1809
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,520
states of the system

1810
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,440
and so that's where we're gonna already

1811
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,319
see that we can reach into that semantic

1812
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,920
world i'm gonna just um skip through

1813
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,039
this part so that we can get to the the

1814
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,799
syntheses of the paper and the last

1815
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,119
figures so here's where we get to

1816
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,839
figure three so now we're seeing that

1817
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:48,319
through

1818
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,480
this pretty elegant and minimalist

1819
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,440
structure

1820
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,920
when the organism minimizes its expected

1821
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,720
free energy

1822
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,400
which is always going to be a positive

1823
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,839
number because the informational

1824
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,920
divergence between any two distributions

1825
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,039
is positive

1826
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,359
if you minimize g you're going to come

1827
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,480
to the best pi

1828
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,720
the best policy selection and that

1829
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,079
policy selection

1830
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,880
is going to use input from the emitted

1831
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,000
sensory states

1832
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,160
to reduce uncertainty about hidden

1833
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,280
causes in the world

1834
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,960
d um

1835
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,400
and this is where they get to

1836
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,480
the questions about content of

1837
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,920
representation

1838
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,440
and so here is where they're going to

1839
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,599
return to those

1840
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,640
uh the desired features of neural

1841
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,839
representation

1842
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,760
but here is where they approach it the

1843
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,440
mathematical contents of a neural

1844
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,480
representation

1845
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,960
and where they propose a uh based upon

1846
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,480
eagan 2019

1847
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,640
a computational theory proper for

1848
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,839
representation

1849
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,760
and so the aspects of representation

1850
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,839
that they're going to pursue

1851
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,240
are the mathematical function that's

1852
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,599
being realized

1853
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,680
that's like the uh the mathematical

1854
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,599
component then there's the specific

1855
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,440
algorithms or the process theory

1856
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,280
by which the system actually does

1857
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,359
compute that so it's one thing to say

1858
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,599
well the ants are doing a you know np

1859
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:06,079
hard

1860
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,319
optimization problem it's another thing

1861
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,319
to ask what are the rules that each

1862
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,440
ant is engaged in such that that

1863
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,400
optimization

1864
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,920
is the outcome third are the questions

1865
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,240
about representational structures

1866
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,480
so that's like not what is the ant

1867
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,720
colony doing or what does one ant

1868
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,680
do but what is the representation of the

1869
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,680
ants across the whole colony through

1870
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,319
time

1871
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,440
as it solves the problem

1872
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,839
what are the computational processes

1873
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,880
that are defined

1874
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,119
over representations so the

1875
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,160
representation

1876
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,240
is that distribution of ants in the

1877
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,480
colony the distribution of active neural

1878
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,920
states in the brain

1879
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,079
and what is the computational process

1880
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,280
that is defined

1881
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,359
over representations that links them

1882
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,160
together so that they accomplish

1883
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
the mathematical function and then

1884
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,319
lastly is this ecological component

1885
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,680
which is really um

1886
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,319
so critical which is the recognition

1887
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:02,799
that the

1888
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,039
internal dynamics of the system one

1889
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:05,920
through four

1890
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,680
the math the algorithm the

1891
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,200
representation the computational

1892
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,920
component

1893
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,319
that's introspective and we're never

1894
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,280
going to understand

1895
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,119
function or adaptiveness or

1896
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,720
functionality without

1897
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,520
also understanding ecologically what is

1898
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,119
the context that the algorithm is

1899
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,559
occurring within

1900
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,640
um and then is there any thoughts on

1901
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,680
that from either of you two

1902
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,559
cool i thought this was really a nice

1903
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,000
way to

1904
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,119
come from a really well-grounded uh

1905
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,119
definition of what all these different

1906
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,880
components of representation

1907
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,799
and then in the end ground it to the

1908
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,520
real system which is the ecosystem

1909
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,319
okay um now they're going to add this

1910
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:46,960
heuristic

1911
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,920
cognitive content and here we can look

1912
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,799
at

1913
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,640
figure four so in figure four

1914
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,039
this is the deflationary account of the

1915
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,039
contents of representation so remember

1916
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,200
deflationary just means it's just a

1917
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,839
party

1918
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,920
okay it's not a big deal it's just a

1919
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,880
party

1920
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,359
so here is how they're gonna go about

1921
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,480
deflating

1922
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,039
representations and they're gonna split

1923
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:11,839
it into

1924
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,480
two parts that aids in the deflation

1925
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,160
it's kind of like you know when you get

1926
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,599
a package and there's the air bubbles

1927
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,760
and it's partitioned you need to deflate

1928
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,359
each one of those partitions

1929
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,200
so they're gonna separate the world into

1930
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,280
two kinds of components

1931
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,359
cognitive and computational and then

1932
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,720
they're gonna deflate

1933
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,400
um those two aspects so computationally

1934
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,359
we're going to draw off of those eagan

1935
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:35,760
uh

1936
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,359
terms that we just went through one

1937
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,799
through five so there we have

1938
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:39,680
mathematical

1939
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,079
functions algorithms representations

1940
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,559
computational processes and ecology

1941
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,720
those are all computational like in the

1942
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,400
sense of the ecological component

1943
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,039
whatever it is it's just that there's no

1944
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,319
magic in the ecology

1945
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,799
there's no magic in the computation and

1946
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:55,839
then

1947
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,160
over on the left side here the cognitive

1948
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,359
component

1949
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,039
it's actually there's just one air

1950
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,440
bubble to deflate cognition is just

1951
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,640
about intention

1952
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,520
the intentional gloss is what they um

1953
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,559
call it here

1954
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,280
here the cognitive content is taken uh

1955
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,559
oh wait for that little thing to

1956
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:13,599
disappear

1957
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,079
uh as an it is taken in an anti-realist

1958
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:16,799
sense

1959
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,440
in a type of explanatory gloss that only

1960
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,960
has an explanatory

1961
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,720
instrumentalist or remember fiction

1962
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,319
organismal centered fiction

1963
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,960
role as the interpretation given to the

1964
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,079
neural representation

1965
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,039
by the experimenter like oh when this

1966
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,200
set of neurons is activated the mouse

1967
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,520
wants to drink and so you could say

1968
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,480
computationally

1969
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,000
here's the mathematics here's the

1970
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,200
algorithm that's happening the

1971
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,720
representation the computation and the

1972
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,319
ecology with the water

1973
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,720
those are all just what they are and

1974
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,559
then there's the cognitive element which

1975
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,119
we've now

1976
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,039
isolated so that's really where we've

1977
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,319
gotten to is we can isolate the

1978
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:51,760
cognitive part and say

1979
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,000
this is the intentional gloss this is

1980
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,880
the mouse

1981
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,160
thinking about being thirsty

1982
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,839
experiencing being thirsty wanting to be

1983
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,359
thirsty wanting water

1984
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,400
so that's a really nice partitioning

1985
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,079
and that's still within the traditional

1986
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,640
frameworks of computational neuro as

1987
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,240
well as cognitive science

1988
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,839
any thoughts on figure four

1989
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,158
cool um

1990
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,960
then we go back to the paper we hear a

1991
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,158
little bit more about

1992
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,238
fictionalism in the philosophy of

1993
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,198
science

1994
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,158
and suffice to say there's a long uh and

1995
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,359
storied history

1996
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,719
of fictionalism in science uh

1997
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,560
because science is always making models

1998
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,080
that are as if they're true about the

1999
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:34,880
world

2000
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,158
but here's where they say

2001
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,679
they're used by scientists to explain

2002
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,359
intentional behavior they're models used

2003
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,319
by scientists

2004
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,839
again this is kind of a circular

2005
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,920
definition it's like saying

2006
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,520
cognitive neuroscience is whatever

2007
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,520
cognitive neuroscientists do

2008
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,238
it's like yes it's true um and then we

2009
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:53,920
can also look beyond that

2010
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,319
and they discuss this this idea of

2011
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,600
empirical adequacy

2012
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,960
or true enough and that's a key idea

2013
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,880
and uh it's kind of like when people say

2014
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,000
let the data speak

2015
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,560
or uh the data are clear well the data

2016
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,198
were clear

2017
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,839
on epicycles and people were making more

2018
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,080
and more epicycles and getting more and

2019
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,000
more empirical adequacy

2020
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,600
and it was true enough for the people

2021
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,920
who were using them but it was wrong

2022
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,560
so empirical adequacy always must be

2023
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,839
interpreted in a really

2024
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,719
holistic way where even if the model

2025
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,719
precision is extremely high

2026
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,000
even if the model precision is

2027
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,759
increasing you still could be just

2028
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,080
locally overfitting and totally barking

2029
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,600
up the wrong tree

2030
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,799
um okay finally

2031
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,439
near the end of our discussion we reach

2032
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,520
this variational semantics

2033
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,520
where we're going to actually bring all

2034
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,640
these things together

2035
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,198
we have the generative models active

2036
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,880
inference in the free energy principle

2037
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,839
on one side we have semantics and then

2038
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:52,399
we have

2039
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,360
phenotype and we're gonna say phenotype

2040
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:55,600
is

2041
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,520
just phenotype the brain's just doing

2042
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,040
brain stuff the arm is just an

2043
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,840
arm a frog is just a frog and semantics

2044
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,440
are just that they're just

2045
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,679
meaning but how are we going to bridge

2046
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:06,719
these two worlds

2047
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,640
how are we going to go from just neural

2048
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,840
representation

2049
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,199
to just meaning

2050
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,440
well first they bring up the viewpoint

2051
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,960
that the deflationary view of

2052
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,000
representation

2053
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,600
downplays the role of the fifth

2054
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,960
ecological component of the

2055
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,800
computational theory proper

2056
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,360
so what their claim is here is that um

2057
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,600
deflationary

2058
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,719
representationalism from a computational

2059
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,480
perspective which is like mainstream

2060
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,520
science

2061
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,000
discusses the first four points here a

2062
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,719
lot

2063
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,880
but they ignore the ecological component

2064
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,560
so i certainly resonate with this

2065
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,280
critique

2066
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,040
and that's why earlier i said this is

2067
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,800
one of the strengths of the free energy

2068
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,480
principle is it reminds us

2069
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,640
even when we're drilling down into the

2070
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
thirst center of the mouse

2071
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,640
how could you ever really extract that

2072
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,480
from the ecological context

2073
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,199
where there's water or no water um the

2074
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,239
body states

2075
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,960
where it's uh dehydrated or not and how

2076
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,320
could you even extract that from the

2077
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,480
evolutionary history of water being

2078
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
available or being associated with other

2079
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,880
sensory cues

2080
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,040
um here's where they connect it to the

2081
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,320
free energy principle

2082
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,000
they're going to say the formalism that

2083
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,360
is underwriting the free energy

2084
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,000
principle

2085
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,400
licenses or allows us to have a crucial

2086
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,440
observation

2087
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,280
which is that the mathematical

2088
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,880
structures and processes

2089
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,440
are defined over a state space remember

2090
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,960
information geometry

2091
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,760
and implicitly over an associated belief

2092
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,080
space or a statistical manifold

2093
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,120
so manifold is a lower dimensional

2094
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,280
representation of a higher dimensional

2095
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,480
uh

2096
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,960
pattern so if you have some sort of high

2097
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,400
dimensional pattern but you project it

2098
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,679
into low dimensions

2099
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,600
it might exist on a line in two

2100
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,360
dimensions even though it was a cluster

2101
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,560
in 100 dimensions

2102
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,000
and that's sort of the idea of these

2103
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,760
manifold techniques and

2104
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,000
another mapping that to bring it one

2105
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,360
level closer to the paper

2106
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,719
is like there's a manifold that's a

2107
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,280
continuum thirsty to not thirsty

2108
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,040
and then there's so many neural states i

2109
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,640
mean we have billions of neurons and

2110
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,520
other cells

2111
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,560
maybe individual neural states are never

2112
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,360
replicated ever because each one is so

2113
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,760
unique and the brain is always changing

2114
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,719
but you can project down onto this

2115
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,719
internal manifold which is thirsty to

2116
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:17,600
not thirsty

2117
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
across your life even as the number of

2118
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,679
neurons you have changes or the neurons

2119
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:22,719
fundamentally change

2120
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,239
themself um so we're going to use

2121
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,320
this idea that the environment is

2122
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,560
important and that the internal states

2123
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,719
are mapping onto an internal statistical

2124
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:33,600
manifold

2125
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,159
um specifically an action-oriented one

2126
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:36,640
and then

2127
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,520
we're gonna bring that to semantics any

2128
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,719
thoughts before we move forward

2129
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,560
okay cool so

2130
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,480
it is often noted that one does not

2131
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,480
obtain semantic content from mere

2132
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,400
systematic covariation

2133
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,199
so that's sort of the uh helen keller

2134
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:57,760
initial

2135
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,080
learning approach which was like she

2136
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,520
learned famously

2137
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,600
by having water on her hand and then

2138
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,719
having sign language

2139
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,440
spell out water on her hand so that was

2140
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,440
an instantaneous co-variation

2141
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,080
between a symbol string of sign language

2142
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
and a sensory experience of water

2143
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,560
and so that was like the rosetta stone

2144
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,679
for linking

2145
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,159
an external event and sensory sequence

2146
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:20,800
to

2147
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,920
um symbols that that's uh lexical

2148
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,120
semantics delivered as sign language but

2149
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,960
that's not how we get all of our

2150
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,199
semantic content

2151
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,000
um under the free energy principle there

2152
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,159
is an implicit semantics at play

2153
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,640
that is baked into the system's dynamics

2154
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,920
by evolution

2155
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,760
so there's something about sugar that

2156
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,239
tastes good there's something about

2157
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,320
warmth at the right level that feels

2158
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,000
good um

2159
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,840
that is something that evolution has

2160
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,320
endowed us with because we're not simply

2161
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,159
randomly assembled combinations of

2162
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,360
phenotypes we

2163
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,840
we've been ecologically selected to

2164
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,640
experience

2165
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,520
a semantic quality to different types of

2166
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,719
sensory experiences

2167
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,080
and that's not to say that they're not

2168
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,239
plastic or they can't be learned

2169
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,600
or nuanced can't be added but there is

2170
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,159
uh potentially within this trajectory of

2171
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,320
states on the internal manifold

2172
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,800
there actually is the hope of a formal

2173
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,560
semantics that could fall out of this

2174
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,920
system's dynamics

2175
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,120
and therefore be characterized

2176
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,440
mathematically but the hope for a formal

2177
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,640
semantics

2178
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,320
that arises from phenotype

2179
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,320
representation is there

2180
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,719
because the world actually does have

2181
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,960
order and stimuli actually do

2182
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,840
have valence in the world any thoughts

2183
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,159
on that

2184
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,199
okay here's where we take stock in

2185
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,199
section 4.2

2186
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,280
we have we have retained the general

2187
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,600
description of representational content

2188
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,120
from the deflationary account

2189
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,920
so in other words we got what we wanted

2190
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,679
out of the deflationary account which is

2191
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:54,239
to say

2192
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,320
brains are just brains ecosystems are

2193
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,520
just ecosystems

2194
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,239
meaning is just meaning we deflated

2195
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,440
everything else away

2196
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,239
now we're left with just what's there we

2197
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:04,640
now

2198
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,800
will use this deflationary model to

2199
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,440
specify a computational theory proper

2200
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,520
that leads to a formal semantics via the

2201
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,800
free energy principle

2202
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,440
so let's return here here's the fallacy

2203
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,000
um

2204
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,760
that people were making they would

2205
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,199
define mathematics

2206
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,040
algorithms representation computational

2207
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,400
processes of a system

2208
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,360
bacteria or the mouse or a simulation

2209
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,000
but

2210
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,480
it was always focused on the system of

2211
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,360
interest

2212
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,239
and so without specifying the ecology it

2213
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,080
was kind of like building a castle on

2214
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,880
nothing

2215
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,679
because the internal representations the

2216
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,360
computational components

2217
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,400
were not grounded in the evolutionary or

2218
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,679
ecological niche

2219
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,800
of function and therefore the cognitive

2220
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,719
component and the intentional gloss was

2221
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:49,840
kind of open-ended

2222
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,920
it's like okay this neuron is activated

2223
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,600
when the mouse is drinking water

2224
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,320
so maybe that means the mouse is thirsty

2225
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:56,800
um

2226
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,800
the missing piece was the ecological

2227
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,400
component

2228
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,679
um then they're going to they say

2229
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,520
figure four i believe that they mean

2230
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,960
figure 5

2231
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,040
uh or maybe they are referring to the

2232
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,400
previous figure 4.

2233
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,920
but here is where they're going to

2234
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,159
reformat egan's

2235
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,280
uh scheme which is here on the screen

2236
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,600
they're going to reformat that in terms

2237
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,000
of the paradigm of free energy principle

2238
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,719
so this is like the big um synthesis

2239
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:25,199
piece

2240
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,360
this is you know almost at the end of

2241
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,560
our discussion where we've really

2242
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,199
reached

2243
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,000
their synthesis they're saying look the

2244
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,840
common framework is computational

2245
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,960
dynamics

2246
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,440
not computational components and

2247
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,800
cognitive components

2248
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,280
that are you're going to split up but

2249
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,440
it's all about computational

2250
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,239
dynamics that's as deflationary as you

2251
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,040
can get

2252
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,159
we separated and deflated into a

2253
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,280
cognitive component

2254
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,239
and then guess what we realize that by

2255
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,080
having an ecological component

2256
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,239
we don't even need intention because

2257
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,159
intention oh well maybe if this neuron

2258
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,400
is activated the mouse is thirsty

2259
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,400
now you don't need to worry about that

2260
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,440
you can just say

2261
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,840
the mouse is this ecological agent that

2262
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
has to reduce its uncertainty about how

2263
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,040
thirsty it is

2264
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,199
and using that partitioning of the

2265
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,800
fischer information equations that we

2266
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,679
kind of passed

2267
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,400
over earlier we can formalize the

2268
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,159
ecological relationship

2269
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,280
of the mouse to the surroundings and by

2270
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,000
doing so

2271
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,120
we can get intentional like claims like

2272
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,120
the mouse wants to drink water it's

2273
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,719
trying to open up the water bottle

2274
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,320
it's running as fast as it can to get

2275
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,960
water we get these types of intentional

2276
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,600
like claims coming out of here from the

2277
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,840
ecological component

2278
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,560
vis-a-vis dual information geometry and

2279
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,239
so here is where they unpack

2280
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,719
each of these components of eagan within

2281
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,920
the free energy principle

2282
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,000
so the mathematical function that is

2283
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,960
being enacted

2284
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,360
is the free energy functional which is

2285
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,120
the minimization of expected

2286
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,679
free energy given the generative model

2287
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,040
of the organism

2288
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,440
the algorithm that the organism uses to

2289
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,560
carry this out

2290
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,800
is stochastic variational gradient

2291
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,120
descent on free energy

2292
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,880
um which will show one little thing

2293
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,280
after this the representational

2294
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,159
structure uh are the internal states of

2295
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:14,719
the model

2296
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,880
reflected by these lower dimensional

2297
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,920
manifolds

2298
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,480
and then the computational process by

2299
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,920
which these representations

2300
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,640
morph and evolve is active inference and

2301
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,280
then

2302
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,040
we're grounding it in the piece that is

2303
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,880
most lacking for mainstream science

2304
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,719
which is the ecological component

2305
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,880
specifically formalized here as dual

2306
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,400
information geometry

2307
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,520
okay that's the big

2308
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,080
claim any thoughts on that or how does

2309
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,280
that strike both of you

2310
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:45,599
after like hearing that whole lead-up

2311
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,520
i think this figure sums it up really

2312
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,800
nicely and draws the kind of

2313
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,239
parallels that encompass

2314
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,960
the setup of the aims so it's really

2315
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,120
nice and i agree that the ecological

2316
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,760
component

2317
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,840
is is lacking and

2318
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,920
is quite important in actually

2319
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,880
understanding

2320
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,920
what the system is doing

2321
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:18,239
cool yvonne anything

2322
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,120
okay so let's return to the paper

2323
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,239
um much hangs philosophically

2324
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,000
on what it means to represent a target

2325
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,840
domain in terms of the relationship

2326
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,239
between

2327
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,040
mental states mind and physical states

2328
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:33,920
that realize them

2329
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,920
brain so now we're talking about the

2330
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,040
mind brain

2331
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,080
mapping mind is the intentional gloss

2332
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,800
that's like well the mind wants this and

2333
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,600
then the question

2334
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,320
has always been well how is the mind

2335
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,440
related to the brain

2336
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,120
and we're not coming at this from the

2337
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,480
question of how is consciousness

2338
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,920
generated in the brain or other

2339
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,159
uh areas that also deal with mind and

2340
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,199
brain duality

2341
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,159
but just specifically using

2342
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,199
representationism as the wedge

2343
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,800
there's a representation of wanting

2344
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,719
water and then there's the brain state

2345
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,800
and that's what we've been all about is

2346
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,400
exploring this connection

2347
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,679
between wanting water and actual neural

2348
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,719
firing patterns

2349
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,600
and non-neural things happening like

2350
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,199
hormone levels and all these other

2351
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:15,920
components

2352
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,239
that aren't even being attempted to be

2353
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,360
described by

2354
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,560
neural network models or other features

2355
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,280
um there now this is where they

2356
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,880
philosophically tie it all

2357
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,920
together and again this fristen at all

2358
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,719
2020

2359
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,280
paper uh there's a lot more philosophy

2360
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,360
to delve into and the citations and this

2361
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,800
these will be papers we explore in

2362
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,639
future discussions

2363
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,840
but um of the philosophical perspectives

2364
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,760
that relate mental and physical states

2365
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,880
mind and brain

2366
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,880
ours is most consonant with

2367
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,040
functionalism and therefore the multiple

2368
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,960
realizations that it entails

2369
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,719
functionalism is the view that features

2370
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,480
that characterize mental states

2371
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,320
are not intrinsic features of a state

2372
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,000
but rather the function which is the

2373
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,480
input

2374
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,719
output mapping between that state and

2375
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,159
other states of the system

2376
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,080
so here's where they're tying it to a

2377
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,000
lot of other previous

2378
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,960
ideas related to cognitive science and

2379
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,440
other areas

2380
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,280
then they returned to some of those

2381
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,719
earlier questions like

2382
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,560
can you get a misrepresentation and they

2383
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,040
then talk about some future research

2384
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,719
where you actually are able to

2385
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,000
objectively ask how well

2386
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,679
does the sensory data conform to

2387
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,600
hypotheses about what caused them

2388
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,040
so that would open up the door to

2389
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,360
misrepresentation not that it's a binary

2390
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,560
state correct or incorrect

2391
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,159
representation but you'd be able to look

2392
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,080
at two different representations

2393
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,320
and ask which one was more accurate you

2394
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,080
know if you have two maps of the subway

2395
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,080
and one of them is causing you no

2396
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,199
surprises when you're

2397
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,800
using it and the other one there's

2398
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,199
outdated stops and the schedule is off

2399
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,080
it's pretty clear that that state

2400
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:52,960
representation

2401
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,280
of the map is less adequate it's less

2402
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,320
good of a model

2403
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,960
and that gives us this key feature of

2404
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,400
representations being able to

2405
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,920
misrepresent

2406
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,000
which is important for being able to act

2407
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
well but we're also not going to fall

2408
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,840
into this absolutist trap

2409
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,679
where there's like a best representation

2410
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,000
or only representation

2411
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,400
um and that's actually the last

2412
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,239
paragraph they basically ask

2413
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,719
that yes under the free energy principle

2414
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,400
there are structures internal to an

2415
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,920
organism that are the bearers of

2416
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,520
semantic content

2417
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,480
we can specify these internal structures

2418
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,360
in terms of

2419
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,840
deflationary computational theories

2420
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,600
figure five

2421
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,840
um and by virtue of the double

2422
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
information geometries that are in play

2423
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,600
under the free energy principle that's

2424
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,239
the part the thermodynamic or the

2425
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:41,199
thermo-informational partitioning of

2426
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,280
internal and external states by markov

2427
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,159
blankets

2428
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,920
so we'd make this dual information

2429
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,480
geometry ecological partitioning

2430
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,960
and then we actually can use our

2431
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,480
mathematical account

2432
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,600
to reach an implicit semantics which is

2433
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,080
the set of hypotheses about underlying

2434
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,280
causal factors

2435
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,120
that the system is parsing in order to

2436
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,000
make sense of its sensory stream

2437
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,760
this might be seen as vindicating the

2438
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,480
structural representationalist account

2439
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,239
um in other words so if it's

2440
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,600
deflationary are we

2441
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,920
uh vindicating the idea that it's just

2442
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,280
neurons

2443
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,080
but there's a a critical twist the

2444
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,960
critical twist

2445
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,560
is that those structures that bear

2446
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,719
contents are not merely

2447
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,880
neural representations but indeed

2448
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,560
phenotypic representations

2449
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,159
versus the internal states of an

2450
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,960
organism given the markovian partition

2451
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,679
that bear this content and this is like

2452
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:34,480
a really

2453
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,120
um amazing way to close the paper

2454
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,400
because it's saying

2455
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,199
yes neurons are involved but depending

2456
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,360
on what level the cognitive process is

2457
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,639
playing out on

2458
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,960
that is going to co-define where the

2459
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,239
markovian blanket

2460
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,960
is so for example if multiple people are

2461
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,239
on a team together

2462
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:53,920
and the team is engaged in collective

2463
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,840
cognition then

2464
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,560
that team markov blanket is actually the

2465
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,040
one

2466
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,800
that is bearing the representational

2467
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,199
content so multi-party

2468
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,280
dialogue is actually being represented

2469
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,560
at the group level

2470
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,239
though there also could be smaller

2471
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,000
markov blankets that could be drawn

2472
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,480
around each person each brain region

2473
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,400
each neuron each organelle

2474
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,199
everything is always fractal fractal

2475
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,719
hierarchical embedded

2476
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,600
but for utility we can actually draw out

2477
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,159
these uh

2478
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,199
partitions as they've suggested so that

2479
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,560
is the end of the paper

2480
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,560
it's almost the end of our time and i

2481
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,080
think it's just good if we

2482
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,679
um had any closing thoughts before we

2483
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,280
shut it down but this was really an

2484
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,080
awesome discussion

2485
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,239
so maybe what's one thing that you took

2486
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,239
away from the paper or one thing that

2487
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,679
you're still wondering about at the end

2488
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,040
of it

2489
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,840
i just i just understand i need to read

2490
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,679
it again

2491
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,719
one more time i had i had your

2492
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,760
presentation and

2493
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,440
i go through the through the paper with

2494
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,719
it but

2495
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,760
still i need to dip more

2496
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,000
perfect always we can dig deeper sasha

2497
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,120
um yeah that was really useful to walk

2498
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,560
through

2499
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,920
this whole paper um incredibly dense but

2500
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,360
i like what you said about the last

2501
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,320
closing statement is that it's kind of a

2502
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,840
um yeah free energy is the lens to look

2503
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,400
through

2504
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,960
and by placing the markov blanket at

2505
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,960
different

2506
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,760
places in the system it can be

2507
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,120
scientifically useful

2508
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,560
for us to understand the system

2509
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,440
as it's useful to the organism that's uh

2510
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,320
using that representation

2511
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,360
well said well said so

2512
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,400
that concludes our discussion thanks a

2513
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,120
lot for

2514
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,440
listening everybody who's listening live

2515
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,800
or in replay

2516
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,920
this has been a team com podcast number

2517
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,880
two

2518
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,679
and um we are always open to

2519
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:02,639
participants

2520
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,199
and to suggestions about how we could

2521
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,560
discuss these ideas

2522
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,239
better how we could bring it to the

2523
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,840
people in a more exciting and

2524
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,280
participatory way

2525
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,840
so get in touch with us thanks again for

2526
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,880
listening and i'm going to
