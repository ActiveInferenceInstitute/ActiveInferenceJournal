00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,707
Daniel: Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:12,348
This is active inference Livestream

3
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:12,348
number 54.0.

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:18,903
We're discussing mathematical foundations

5
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:18,903
for a compositional account of the

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:18,903
Bayesian Brain.

7
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,192
Welcome to the active institute.

8
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:28,902
We're a participatory online institute

9
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:28,902
that is communicating, learning and

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:28,902
practicing applied active inference.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,587
This is a recorded, archived and

12
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:34,587
published Livestream, so please provide

13
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:34,587
feedback so we can improve our work.

14
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:51,273
All backgrounds and perspective are

15
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:51,273
welcome and we'll follow video etiquette

16
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:51,273
for Livestream, head over Active

17
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:51,273
Inference.org to learn more about getting

18
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:51,273
involved in live streams and in a variety

19
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:51,273
of other projects and learning groups.

20
00:00:53,403 --> 00:01:16,148
All right, well, we're in stream number

21
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
54.0 and we're going to be learning and

22
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
discussing the paper that was submitted

23
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
on the 23 December 2022 as part of a

24
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
dissertation work, mathematical

25
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
Foundations for a Compositional Account

26
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,148
of the Bayesian Brain by Toby St. Clere

27
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:17,277
Smithe.

28
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:23,869
The video is an introduction for some of

29
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:23,869
the ideas in this multi hundred page

30
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:23,869
thesis.

31
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:43,810
It's not a review or a final word or a

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,810
thesis dissertation committee, this 54.0,

33
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,810
given the scope and the complexity, but

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,810
also accessibility of the ideas, we're

35
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,810
going to be approaching it in a familiar

36
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:43,810
way, but also with some twists.

37
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:49,043
We're going to begin with some

38
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:49,043
introductions, the aims and claims,

39
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:49,043
abstract and roadmap as usual.

40
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:57,126
Then we're going to approach the keywords

41
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:57,126
and the context in a slightly different

42
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:57,126
way than we've done in a lot of other

43
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:57,126
zeros.

44
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:10,194
And then we're going to kind of bookend

45
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,194
the dissertation and focus most on

46
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,194
chapter one and chapter seven, the first

47
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,194
and the final chapter and chapters two

48
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,194
through six.

49
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:15,244
We're looking forward to unpacking more

50
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:15,244
with Toby in the coming weeks.

51
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:20,298
So we'll begin with some introductions

52
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:20,298
and warm ups.

53
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:30,394
We could all just say hello and something

54
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:30,394
that was exciting for us about the paper

55
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:30,394
dissertation or what brought us to the

56
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:30,394
work.

57
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:31,402
I'll begin.

58
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:32,411
I'm Daniel.

59
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:53,627
I'm a researcher in California, and I

60
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
have to say that six months ago, when we

61
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
started this journey haw on the heels of

62
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
the dissertation being posted when, along

63
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
with Ali and Dean and others, we decided

64
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
to embark on this weekly learning quest,

65
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
I was very unfamiliar with category

66
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:53,627
theory.

67
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:58,674
And thankfully, after closing the window,

68
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:58,674
it all escapes my mind.

69
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:04,679
So it's been quite a six month period to

70
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:04,679
learn and to forget so much.

71
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,699
I'll pass to Dean.

72
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:08,713
Dean: Thanks, Daniel.

73
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,730
I'm Dean, I'm here in Calgary.

74
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:43,068
I think the thing for me, when it was

75
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
first broached the idea of taking this up

76
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
about a decade ago, I started just

77
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
scratching the surface of this idea

78
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
called category theory, and to see this

79
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
amount of work put together, to sort of

80
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
bring a whole bunch of ideas together

81
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
and, as Daniel already mentioned, make it

82
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
somewhat accessible or I don't know if

83
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
it's a beginner's guide or a category

84
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:43,068
theory for dummies.

85
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:44,073
Exactly.

86
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:46,098
Because there's still a lot in here.

87
00:03:47,100 --> 00:04:01,182
But in terms of giving us an opportunity

88
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:01,182
to get some verifications, for me, at

89
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:01,182
least that's what I got with some

90
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:01,182
validations and some verifications was

91
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:01,182
really helpful.

92
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:11,283
So I am excited about having a chance to

93
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:11,283
talk about this and bring the author on

94
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:11,283
eventually and have that conversation get

95
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:11,283
extended and I'll pass it over to Ali.

96
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,336
Ali: Thank you.

97
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:20,373
I'm Ali, I'm an independent researcher

98
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:20,373
from Iran.

99
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:35,520
Well, I also had just a passing

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,520
familiarity with category theory and

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,520
wasn't familiar at all with lots of

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,520
terminology and formalism in this

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,520
thesis.

104
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:47,640
But after covering the whole thesis in

105
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:47,640
our six month period, it now begins to

106
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:47,640
make much more sense.

107
00:04:49,666 --> 00:05:04,754
I definitely started seeing category

108
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:04,754
theory in almost everywhere, both in

109
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:04,754
sciences and also in some other, not

110
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:04,754
specifically scientific areas.

111
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:14,850
So I'm really excited to have these

112
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:14,850
discussions with Toby and learn even a

113
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:14,850
lot more.

114
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:14,858
Thanks.

115
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,876
Daniel: Excellent.

116
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,900
All right, on we go.

117
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,934
We'll begin here with a meta prompt.

118
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:31,026
So for all of you human and non human

119
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:31,026
language models, please fill your context

120
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:31,026
window with this metaprompt.

121
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,078
On to the big questions.

122
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:43,147
So we have some hidden questions that are

123
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:43,147
in white font below that those who go to

124
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:43,147
the slides will find and discover.

125
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:47,180
But we raised many questions.

126
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:52,230
And Dean or Ali, what's just a question

127
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,230
that strikes you today?

128
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:57,285
What is a question that would lead

129
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:57,285
someone to come to this dissertation?

130
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:05,305
And we're going to be covering a lot of

131
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:05,305
Toby's summaries in terms of the

132
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:05,305
contributions, Ames claims and foci of

133
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:05,305
the dissertation.

134
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:12,374
But what does this dissertation ask or

135
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:12,374
what would somebody ask to get to this

136
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:12,374
dissertation?

137
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,414
Yeah, please, Dean.

138
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:32,571
Dean: I think the first thing for me was

139
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:32,571
if we are pattern seekers and pattern

140
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:32,571
impliers, then if you're going to look at

141
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:32,571
what the formalism behind that is, then

142
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:32,571
this is a good place to start.

143
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:50,750
If you want to know why we tend to put

144
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
things into groups, why things have a

145
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
world where there's something that's in a

146
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
category or outside of a category, and

147
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
most importantly, where are the things

148
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
that aren't in either of those two

149
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,750
places?

150
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:57,823
This gives you some of the operational

151
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:57,823
backbone to be able to start figuring

152
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:57,823
that out.

153
00:06:59,840 --> 00:06:59,847
Daniel: Awesome.

154
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:03,828
All right, on we go.

155
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,858
Aims and claims of the paper.

156
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:21,002
So, paper or dissertation Draft

157
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
mathematical Foundations for a

158
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
Compositional Account of the Bayesian

159
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
Brain was uploaded in late December 2022

160
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
and just several overview claims of the

161
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
work.

162
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:34,136
Our main aim in this thesis is to

163
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
formalize predictive coding through

164
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
functional semantics and Bayesian lenses

165
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
will provide an important part of the

166
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
syntax of statistical models that we

167
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
need.

168
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:45,247
In this 54.0 video, we're only going to

169
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:45,247
cover chapter one and chapter seven, and

170
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:45,247
we're going to review them for some

171
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:45,247
really interesting, bold and ambitious

172
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:45,247
claims.

173
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:56,356
And there's a few great overview claims

174
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:56,356
for the entire work that do a great job

175
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:56,356
of just distilling down so many hundreds

176
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:56,356
of pages and so many technical

177
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:56,356
contributions from page seven.

178
00:07:56,357 --> 00:08:08,418
The main individual contribution of this

179
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:08,418
thesis is the introduction of Bayesian

180
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:08,418
lenses and the proof that Bayesian lenses

181
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:08,418
compose optically and the first sentence

182
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:08,418
of the abstract.

183
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,488
This dissertation reports some first

184
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:15,488
steps towards a compositional account of

185
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:15,488
active inference and the Bayesian brain.

186
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,518
Anything else to add on aims and claims?

187
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:28,616
Okay, either of you please start with the

188
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:28,616
first half of the abstract.

189
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:30,639
Dean: I'll read it.

190
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,654
Go for it, Dean.

191
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:32,658
Ali: Yeah.

192
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,714
Dean: The dissertation reports some first

193
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:38,714
steps towards compositional count of

194
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:38,714
active inference and the Bayesian brain.

195
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:48,813
Specifically, we use the tools of

196
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:48,813
contemporary applied category theory to

197
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:48,813
supply functional semantics for

198
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:48,813
approximate inference.

199
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:55,880
To do so, we define, on the syntactic

200
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:55,880
side, the new notion of Bayesian lenses.

201
00:08:55,882 --> 00:09:03,904
Think it's important to get the plural

202
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:03,904
there and show that Bayesian updating

203
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:03,904
composes according to the compositional

204
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:03,904
lens pattern.

205
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:16,033
Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by

206
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,033
compositional game theory, we define

207
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,033
categories of statistical games and use

208
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,033
them to classify various problems of

209
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,033
statistical inference.

210
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:43,306
On the semantic side, we present a new

211
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
formalization of general open dynamical

212
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
systems, particularly deterministic

213
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
stochastic and random and discrete and

214
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
continuous time as certain coalgebras of

215
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
polynomial functions which we show

216
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
collect into monoidal open text

217
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
categories or alternatively, into

218
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
algebras for multi categories of

219
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,306
generalized polynomial functors.

220
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:59,466
We use these openexed categories to

221
00:09:59,466 --> 00:09:59,466
define monoidal bicategories of cilia

222
00:09:59,466 --> 00:09:59,466
dynamical systems which control lenses

223
00:09:59,466 --> 00:09:59,466
and which supply detarget for our

224
00:09:59,466 --> 00:09:59,466
functorial semantics.

225
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,420
Just one quick thing.

226
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:08,493
If you're like me, you had to spend a lot

227
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:08,493
of time finding out what do these words

228
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:08,493
actually mean?

229
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:19,601
Daniel: We're going to come to talk more

230
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:19,601
about words and Ali second half the

231
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:19,601
abstract.

232
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:37,779
Ali: Accordingly, we construct Funk tours

233
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
which explain the bi directional

234
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
compositional structure of predictive

235
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
coding neural circuits under the free

236
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
energy principle, thereby giving a formal

237
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
mathematical underpinning to the bi

238
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:37,779
directionality observed in the cortex.

239
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:51,926
Along the way, we explain how to compose

240
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
rate coded neural circuits using an

241
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
algebra for a multicategory of linear

242
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
circuit diagrams, showing subsequently

243
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
that this is subsumed by lenses and

244
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
polynomial functors.

245
00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:07,028
Because category theory is unfamiliar to

246
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
many computational neuroscientists and

247
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
cognitive scientists, we have made a

248
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
particular effort to give clear, detailed

249
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
and approachable expositions of all the

250
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
category theoretical structures and

251
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,028
results of which we make use.

252
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:19,142
We hope that this dissertation will prove

253
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,142
helpful in establishing a new well typed

254
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,142
science of life and mind and in

255
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,142
facilitating interdisciplinary

256
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,142
communication.

257
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,165
Daniel: Awesome.

258
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:25,206
Okay, here's the roadmap.

259
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:39,340
We're only showing a zoomed out view

260
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,340
because if the other papers we've

261
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,340
discussed were going on a road trip this

262
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,340
is the continent scale road trip.

263
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:45,403
The dissertation is 230 plus pages long.

264
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:54,496
It's in seven chapters that are shown

265
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:54,496
here, and in 54.0, we're going to be

266
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:54,496
focusing on chapter one and chapter

267
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:54,496
seven.

268
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,530
So it's quite a piece of work.

269
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:02,514
And this is just the background and

270
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:02,514
context.

271
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:07,566
There's a table of contents with more

272
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:07,566
information and on what the chapters do.

273
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:21,708
Let's take a few more steps or moments in

274
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:21,708
the background and context to really set

275
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:21,708
up the reading and expressing of this

276
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:21,708
work and really this kind of work.

277
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:27,762
So thanks a lot to Jr for preparing some

278
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:27,762
of the following slides.

279
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:38,878
Here we have some selections from several

280
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:38,878
works in mathematics and category theory

281
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:38,878
on reading math.

282
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,925
There is a real joy in doing

283
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:43,925
mathematics.

284
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:49,988
We've all heard it before, but it really

285
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
comes to be true when we enact it that

286
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
way.

287
00:12:51,006 --> 00:13:05,080
The challenge of mathematical

288
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,080
understanding is to find a way to make

289
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,080
new mental images in oneself on the basis

290
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,080
of formal definitions, to make these

291
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,080
definitions intuitive, to feel what they

292
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,080
are talking about.

293
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:15,180
And Jr's summary of some of the ways that

294
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
math is utilized in this dissertation.

295
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:22,257
So, in regards to the writing in this

296
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:22,257
thesis, just like with anything else,

297
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:22,257
something is being written for an

298
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:22,257
audience.

299
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:31,349
Toby is writing to an audience of domain

300
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:31,349
experts and a dissertation committee,

301
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:31,349
ultimately to demonstrate and embed new

302
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:31,349
contributions to knowledge.

303
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,390
He also takes a pedagogical approach, a

304
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,390
teaching approach.

305
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:41,446
And Jr asked, is this pedagogical

306
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:41,446
approach something you see in most PhD?

307
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:45,485
Theses briefly, I would suggest no.

308
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:51,548
And on the reading of this thesis, it

309
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:51,548
helps to be clear why we're reading it.

310
00:13:52,554 --> 00:14:00,572
If to help understand or sense make

311
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:00,572
active inference models, then aim to read

312
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:00,572
it at one level and take the rest on

313
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:00,572
faith.

314
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:09,661
If we want to understand the formality

315
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
better of the really nitty gritty

316
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
category theory itself, then read to that

317
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
level and go deeper.

318
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:14,713
Any thoughts, either of you fellows on

319
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:14,713
the first Reading Math slide?

320
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:17,740
Okay.

321
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:24,818
And on the second Reading Math slide, a

322
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:24,818
few more great tips on just reading math

323
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:24,818
and what we're doing with math.

324
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,843
So, first, eyes on the prize.

325
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:36,936
Math is a language, and as such, it's

326
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:36,936
there to convey something about the

327
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:36,936
world, about the structure of this thesis

328
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:36,936
overall.

329
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:47,045
And overwhelmingly, there is a plain

330
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:47,045
English exposition of what concepts are

331
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:47,045
needed and why, with nice transitions,

332
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:47,045
foreshadowing and back references.

333
00:14:47,046 --> 00:15:01,122
There's also a true wealth of beautiful

334
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:01,122
diagrams, which in category theory have a

335
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:01,122
formality that those used to schema type

336
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:01,122
diagrams will be pleasantly surprised

337
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:01,122
by.

338
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,157
They're definitely challenging to

339
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:04,157
interpret.

340
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:13,241
It is a new visual language for some,

341
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:13,241
however, it's one that can be admired

342
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:13,241
without necessarily needing all the

343
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:13,241
formality.

344
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:22,335
About roles of definitions in reading of

345
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:22,335
math, what the audience knows is truth is

346
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:22,335
a shared prior belief.

347
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,351
Things start from there.

348
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:36,471
These definitions are used to build up

349
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,471
further truths through logic and the

350
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,471
proofs, and from the Bessis citation in a

351
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,471
mathematical text, the most important

352
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,471
passages are neither proofs nor

353
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,471
theorems.

354
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:37,486
They are definitions.

355
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:47,580
Mathematical language works as a

356
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580
construction game where words are truly

357
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580
defined, that is, constructed from other

358
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580
words that themselves have been

359
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580
previously defined.

360
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:55,665
And about role of proofs in reading

361
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:55,665
maths, very similar to providing well

362
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:55,665
argued evidence in any technical

363
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:55,665
writing.

364
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:02,678
Math is technical writing with math as

365
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:02,678
its particular structure.

366
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,696
And there's other great things to read.

367
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:20,855
But that's all I'll mention here, just at

368
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:20,855
an overview, are there any other thoughts

369
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:20,855
that either of you would add just about

370
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:20,855
reading math or reading this kind of

371
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:20,855
technical work, which can be like getting

372
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:20,855
dropped in the deep end.

373
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:28,936
I mean, we're getting dropped into the

374
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:28,936
cutting edge PhD contribution frontier of

375
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:28,936
knowledge.

376
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:42,077
So how do we negotiate that, especially

377
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:42,077
when there are these esoteric or

378
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:42,077
inscrutable symbolic systems that

379
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:42,077
seemingly constitute the majority of the

380
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:42,077
words in certain passages?

381
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:43,085
Dean.

382
00:16:45,102 --> 00:17:09,289
Dean: I think this might be a slightly

383
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
strange metaphor, but what I would equate

384
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
this process to as a reader, I would

385
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
equate it to being offered to build a

386
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
10,000 piece puzzle, except you have to

387
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
build it backwards so you don't actually

388
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
have the benefit of having image and

389
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
contrast at first.

390
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:17,362
All you basically have is the geometry,

391
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:17,362
but when all the pieces fit together,

392
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:17,362
you're then allowed to flip it over.

393
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,382
So you have to be really committed.

394
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:32,514
And my hat is often to the work that Toby

395
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:32,514
has done because for him to make it

396
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:32,514
coherent, given the actual volume of

397
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:32,514
information that he would like to pass

398
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:32,514
along.

399
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:43,628
Part of my grinding through this was the

400
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
thought in my head that if I'm grinding

401
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
through this, I can't imagine what the

402
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
author had to go through.

403
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,676
So even if you're excited about this,

404
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:48,676
it's still a huge commitment.

405
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:51,709
Daniel: So true.

406
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:53,721
Ollie, anything?

407
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:09,829
Ali: Just wanted to add that well,

408
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:09,829
obviously category theory is very

409
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:09,829
abstract discipline, even for

410
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:09,829
mathematicians.

411
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:30,003
So I agree with Dean that doing such a I

412
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
mean, such an admirable task of

413
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
organizing the materials of the

414
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
dissertation in such a coherent way is

415
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
truly a herculean task to do so.

416
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:46,019
But another point is that, well, even in

417
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:46,019
the realm of category theory, most of the

418
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:46,019
things done so far is done in the purely

419
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:46,019
mathematical world.

420
00:18:46,019 --> 00:19:05,032
So applying those concepts of category

421
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
theoretical concepts to some realms

422
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
outside of mathematics is something

423
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
that's just been explored for the last

424
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
few years at least.

425
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:20,047
Seriously so I believe Toby didn't have

426
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
much to start with, given that the

427
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
scarcity of material in the applied

428
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
category theory area.

429
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:29,056
But of course it's a burgeoning field and

430
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
it's gaining traction quite rapidly.

431
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:42,069
So I hope to see much interesting works

432
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
in the future and I believe Toby's

433
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
dissertation will help a lot in shaping

434
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
the future trajectories.

435
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,075
Daniel: Great comments about applied

436
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
category theory.

437
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,078
On to the keywords.

438
00:19:51,078 --> 00:20:00,081
So three big keywords are category

439
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:00,081
theory, Bayesian brain and active

440
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:00,081
inference.

441
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:18,099
And then category theory is really a

442
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
language of its own for some of the

443
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
relevant keywords that we pulled out in

444
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
our shared epistemic niche, the coda

445
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
document that we utilized to collaborate

446
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
over the last six months as a team.

447
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:28,109
Here's some of the terms that we had on

448
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
the right side and we had a full table

449
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
that people who go to the slides or the

450
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
coda document can explore more.

451
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:38,119
But there were so many creative words,

452
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,119
just words that you're not going to get

453
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,119
outside of applied or basic category

454
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,119
theory.

455
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:52,133
It was quite a learning journey just from

456
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,133
a lexical perspective, so a lot of

457
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,133
keywords and a lot of domain specific

458
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,133
words in category theory.

459
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:57,138
But we keep the bigger picture in mind

460
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
about Bayesian Brain and active

461
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
inference.

462
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:04,139
And one last piece of information here

463
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
before we head off into the dissertation

464
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
itself.

465
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,140
Jr.

466
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:36,171
During their internship over the last

467
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
several months at the Active Inference

468
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
Institute, among other works, completed

469
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
an absolutely beautiful Syllabus

470
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
adventure mode syllabus for introduction

471
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
to category theory applied to active

472
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
inference, and it's hosted on our GitHub

473
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
at the institute, so hopefully people can

474
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
find it useful and continue to version

475
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
and utilize it and make contributions to

476
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
it.

477
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,173
I'll just read the summary.

478
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:51,186
It's for any curious, thrill seeking

479
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
active Inference institute participant

480
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
who wishes to study and conduct further

481
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
research on active inference related

482
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
papers that involve category theoretic

483
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
tools.

484
00:21:51,186 --> 00:22:03,192
And we have a fractal embedding of a

485
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
quotation from Christopher White on model

486
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
stream number 1.1 we have a finite time

487
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
on this earth, right, and a finite time

488
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
to dedicate to learning things.

489
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:12,201
The syllabus is centered around the Joy

490
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:12,201
and the dissertation, so another category

491
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:12,201
theoretic work for background and the

492
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:12,201
dissertation itself.

493
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:30,219
The approach is based on experiences

494
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
within the category theory learning

495
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
group, insights from the Topos Institute

496
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
Category Theory Outreach Panel and Chang

497
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
and the Joy Book Club, and this great

498
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
line from Emily Real in her book Category

499
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
Theory and Context in the Note to the

500
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
Reader's section.

501
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:47,236
Inevitably, given the diversity of

502
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
mathematical tastes and experiences, the

503
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
examples presented here will seldom be

504
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
optimized for any particular individual,

505
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
and indeed, each reader is encouraged to

506
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
search for their own context in which to

507
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
explore categorical ideas.

508
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:58,247
So this curriculum is something that will

509
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:58,247
be living and versioning as we move

510
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:58,247
forward in the active inference applied

511
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:58,247
category space.

512
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:59,248
Super exciting.

513
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:10,253
So thanks again Jr, for the epic

514
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
contribution and we all reviewed the

515
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
syllabus and just found so many

516
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
interesting aspects to it.

517
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:14,257
So there's a lot to learn, no surprises

518
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:14,257
there.

519
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:24,267
But it's awesome when other adventurers

520
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:24,267
help create spaces and ways for others to

521
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:24,267
go on their own adventures.

522
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:28,271
And it really feels like in category

523
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,271
theory that there is a culture of that.

524
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,273
So it's really encouraging.

525
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:36,279
Okay, to the overview of the dissertation

526
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:36,279
itself.

527
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:42,285
As stated earlier, there are seven

528
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:42,285
chapters.

529
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,287
Chapter one is an introduction.

530
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:51,294
Chapter two is a comprehensive review of

531
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
the concepts and results needed to

532
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
understand the mathematical

533
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
contributions.

534
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:58,301
Chapter three begins to re approach

535
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,301
neural modeling and more generally, the

536
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,301
algebraic modeling of the structure of

537
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,301
interacting systems.

538
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:07,304
Chapter four presents the first main

539
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:07,304
result that Bayesian Updating composes

540
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:07,304
according to the categorical lens

541
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:07,304
pattern.

542
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:17,314
Chapter five introduces the corresponding

543
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
semantical categories with a new abstract

544
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
formalization of the concept of open

545
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
dynamical system.

546
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:50,347
Chapter Six presents the functional

547
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
formalization of predictive coding using

548
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
a new notion of approximate inference

549
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
doctrine by which statistical models are

550
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
translated into dynamical systems, and

551
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
chapter Seven reviews the prospects for

552
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
future work from the Mathematics of the

553
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
cognitive map a program called

554
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
compositional cognitive cartography to

555
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
the composition of multiagent systems and

556
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
ecosystems and the connections with

557
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
compositional, game theory, and other

558
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
categorical approaches to cybernetics.

559
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:58,355
Aliyardine, any overall thoughts on the

560
00:24:58,355 --> 00:24:58,355
seven parthe structure of the

561
00:24:58,355 --> 00:24:58,355
dissertation?

562
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:15,366
Dean: Just real quick, if you decide that

563
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
you want to read this and use this as

564
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
your leverage point, I would suggest that

565
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
maybe you do it in the usual

566
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
chronological order.

567
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,370
But you also will find that you can work

568
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
backwards.

569
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,375
In fact, there's stuff in chapter seven

570
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:25,375
that literally points you in that

571
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:25,375
direction.

572
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:32,382
So you might want to give it like a once

573
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:32,382
over just to sort of orient yourself.

574
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:51,402
And then you should feel free to be able

575
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:51,402
to go bi directionally, just a strategic

576
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:51,402
prompt, because if you get bogged down

577
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:51,402
and it's very easy to get sort of caught

578
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:51,402
up in the minutiae of this, I would just

579
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:51,402
say Zuma, step back.

580
00:25:51,402 --> 00:26:02,407
And if it's not registering on the first

581
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
pass, it might register if you start

582
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
going a little bit backwards and forwards

583
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
instead of just one directional.

584
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,409
Daniel: Great.

585
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:11,416
And just to summarize some of the primary

586
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:11,416
contributions few quotes.

587
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:32,437
The main contribution of this thesis is

588
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
the formalization of models of predictive

589
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
coding circuits as functional semantics

590
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
and the associated development and

591
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
exemplification of categories of

592
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
statistical games, as well as the

593
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
introduction of Bayesian lenses and the

594
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
proof that Bayesian updates compose

595
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
optically that is in some sense like

596
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
optics.

597
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:44,449
We believe our presentation of general

598
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
open dynamical systems as certain

599
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
polynomial coalgebras also to be novel,

600
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
along with a concept of cilia and their

601
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
associated monoidal bicategories.

602
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:55,460
We hope that this dissertation

603
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,460
contributes to a renaissance of cognitive

604
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,460
and computational neuroscience through

605
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,460
the adoption of categorical methods.

606
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,459
We're going to be returning more to all

607
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
of these, so it's going to be cool.

608
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:08,467
And Ollie, it's all good with a video off

609
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
for internet's sake, but just raise your

610
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
hand or bring your video on whenever you

611
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
would like to speak.

612
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:25,484
Before we take the jump, we just pulled

613
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
out two small quotes that's going to help

614
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
us leap off this cliff to map the gap,

615
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
respect it and beyond.

616
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:29,488
So first, from page 226, this is from

617
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
chapter seven.

618
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:44,503
This resemblance becomes even closer when

619
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
one considers the recent Diegetic open

620
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
parentheses Diegetic occurring within the

621
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
context of the story and able to be heard

622
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
by the characters within the story.

623
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:58,516
The recent Diegetic formulation of open

624
00:27:58,516 --> 00:27:58,516
games in which strategies themselves can

625
00:27:58,516 --> 00:27:58,516
be updated using a backwards map from the

626
00:27:58,516 --> 00:27:58,516
arena of the game back into strategies or

627
00:27:58,516 --> 00:27:58,516
rather strategy updates.

628
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:18,531
And then fundamentally, from page 225,

629
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
this is also the idea underlying the

630
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
successor representation of the cognitive

631
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
map, which says roughly that the brain's

632
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
representation of where it is is

633
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
equivalently a representation of where it

634
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
soon expects to be.

635
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:41,554
And so how as we bring that last foot of

636
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
the 6ft off the other side of the cliff

637
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
and jump through the unknown, how do we

638
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
take this immense work and update our

639
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
strategies backwards so that we can

640
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
successfully represent and disseminate

641
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
ourselves?

642
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:48,561
Any final words before we jump into

643
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
chapter one on this topic?

644
00:28:49,562 --> 00:29:15,582
Dean: Just think if you're part of the

645
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
active inference community, and you've

646
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
been wondering if there's been any sort

647
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
of question in your mind as to the role

648
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
of strategy in that relationship between

649
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
inference and action, this is going to be

650
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
really helpful in terms of maybe giving

651
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
you a better sense of you identifying and

652
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
then you carrying out choices.

653
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:22,589
So I think it's very important to now

654
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:22,589
take the leap.

655
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,593
Daniel: Okay, zero to one.

656
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,595
Now we're in chapter one.

657
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:39,606
So for the coming slides, Ali or Dean,

658
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
please just, if you'd like, select one

659
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
bullet point.

660
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:43,610
Feel free to read the bullet point or

661
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:43,610
give any remark.

662
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,614
And on these coming slides we're just

663
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
going to move through.

664
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:52,619
But either of you or both of you, please

665
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:52,619
take the first pass.

666
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:52,619
All right.

667
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:55,622
So chapter one introduction.

668
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,622
Dean: I'll let people read through the

669
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:01,622
slide.

670
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:09,630
I think the one that we bolded here,

671
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
category theory is the mathematics of

672
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
pattern, composition, connection and

673
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
interaction.

674
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:19,640
I think you can read that, but I believe

675
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
you also have to kind of sit back and ask

676
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
yourself, so what does that mean?

677
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,646
So right away they're taking a

678
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
superordinate and they're breaking it up

679
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
into its parts.

680
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:36,657
And so again, there's this world within

681
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
world within world thing that is

682
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
reinforced just in the way that we have

683
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
to try to communicate the ideas to the

684
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
readers.

685
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,661
Daniel: Awesome and Ali.

686
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:59,680
Ali: Yes, and I also think the two

687
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
problems I find in the first page of

688
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
chapter one, namely that each research

689
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
group has not only its own language but

690
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
also its own perspective, and these

691
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
languages and perspectives are not well

692
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
connected.

693
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:09,684
These two issues, I believe, are the

694
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:09,684
organizing themes of the whole

695
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:09,684
dissertation.

696
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:34,709
And we see these issues addressed time

697
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
and time again throughout the thesis and

698
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
particularly in chapter seven, which

699
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
these issues are addressed quite

700
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
explicitly, both in terms of the work or

701
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
the contribution done in this thesis and

702
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
the suggestions for future research.

703
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:45,720
The other point is that the language of

704
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
category theory is homo iconic and can be

705
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
used to translate constructions between

706
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
contexts.

707
00:31:45,720 --> 00:32:00,729
So again, right at the beginning, this

708
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
dissertation tries to put a particular

709
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
perspective in order to address the two

710
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
issues just mentioned.

711
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:12,741
So in this case, Toby uses the homo

712
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
iconic property of category theory to

713
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
address those two issues.

714
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:29,758
Or more explicitly, category theory

715
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:29,758
resolves both problems of scientific

716
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:29,758
translations in this way that concepts

717
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:29,758
expressed categorically are inevitably

718
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:29,758
expressed in context and not in

719
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:29,758
isolation.

720
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:39,768
And secondly, these contexts are

721
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
naturally interconnected as if by a

722
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
categorical web with the connections and

723
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
expressed categorically.

724
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:55,784
So in other words, category theory

725
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
provides probably the ideal toolkit to

726
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
address those situations, those issues,

727
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
which I believe is not restricted only to

728
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
scientific endeavors.

729
00:32:55,784 --> 00:33:05,788
So these two issues come up in many other

730
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:05,788
areas and outside science as well.

731
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:17,800
So in that case, I believe category

732
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
theory can provide a much more general

733
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
framework to address them, even in non

734
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
scientific fields as well.

735
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,804
Dean: Can I just add on to what Ali just

736
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
said there real quick?

737
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:25,808
I agree with you 100%, Allie, about the

738
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:25,808
toolkit.

739
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:37,820
And I would add that I also believe it

740
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:37,820
gives us an opening to develop a rule kit

741
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:37,820
so that we can actually figure out how to

742
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:37,820
do that translation piece.

743
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,822
And it also gives us a pool.

744
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:56,839
I like to use things that rhyme because

745
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
it's easy to remember, but the way that

746
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
we collect how things congregate, what

747
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
that attractor state becomes so that we

748
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
can then figure out how things are moving

749
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
in that dynamic situation.

750
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,837
So I think it provides a toolkit, a rule

751
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
kit, and a pool kit.

752
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
Daniel: Great.

753
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:08,845
All right, next slide on chapter one.

754
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:11,848
I'll just pick one and then either of you

755
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:11,848
please.

756
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:22,859
The one that's exciting to me is we show

757
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
that the theory of predictive coding has

758
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
a clear compositional structure that

759
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
explains the bi directional circuitry

760
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
observed in the brain.

761
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:48,884
So even outside of the connection to the

762
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
empirical grounded embodied biology, the

763
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
idea that a lot of the ways that in

764
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
retrospect, informally, we've been

765
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
talking over the last years as a field

766
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
and in the institute about the

767
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
compositionality of models and can we

768
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
just plug in the sense states here to the

769
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:48,884
action states here?

770
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:50,887
Can we nest the models these ways?

771
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:55,892
And the ways that we've been thinking

772
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
about the active inference cognitive

773
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
kernel like a Lego kit.

774
00:34:55,892 --> 00:35:05,896
All of this is realizing a level of

775
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:05,896
formality, which doesn't mean

776
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:05,896
inaccessibility, really quite the

777
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:05,896
opposite.

778
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:09,900
That's just accelerating what's possible

779
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
with predictive coding.

780
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,904
Bayesian brain active inference free

781
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
energy principle.

782
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:29,920
So we're really seeing like a dawning of

783
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
the formal compositionality and to be

784
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
able to compose and to be able to

785
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
construct are going to have a

786
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
relationship that we can continue to

787
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,920
weave in the coming sessions.

788
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,923
Either of you want to highlight some

789
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
other piece here?

790
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:45,936
Dean: I think it's really interesting

791
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
because I know that they are trying to

792
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
build an infrastructure, but a lot of

793
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
this dissertation has to do with a

794
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
process that's actually a deconstructor.

795
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:59,950
deconstructure meaning there's a lot of

796
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
pruning and sculpting that they actually

797
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
speak to if we were to talk about real

798
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
things that form and shape and give us

799
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
that sense of what's in and what's out.

800
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:13,958
So yes, they are building an

801
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
infrastructure, but then Toby goes along

802
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
and speaks a whole bunch about so why

803
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
does this stay and why does this not get

804
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
included?

805
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,964
Daniel: Ollie, anything or we'll

806
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:19,964
continue.

807
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:23,968
Ali: Just real quick.

808
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:35,980
It reminds me of Mario Bongay's work on

809
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
causality and also Alan Garfinkel's

810
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
theory of explanation and particularly in

811
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Garfinkel's work.

812
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:59,004
In his book Forms of Explanation, he

813
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
provides a theory of explanation based on

814
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
rigorous modeling of problems in terms of

815
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
state spaces and how we can address the

816
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
context dependent explanations based on

817
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
the contrast space on one hand and the

818
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
relevant space on the other.

819
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:30,029
So category theory, I believe, somehow

820
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
unifies, or in other words, translates

821
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
these kinds of theories into a rigorous

822
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
and coherent framework that can be used

823
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
to formalize or rather to frame all of

824
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
these theories of explanations and

825
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
causalities within a unified framework.

826
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:36,035
So that's, I believe, one of its greatest

827
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:36,035
advantages.

828
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:38,037
Daniel: Great.

829
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,043
Okay, anyone want to give a comment

830
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
here?

831
00:37:49,048 --> 00:38:00,053
I'll just give a quick comment, which is

832
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
and this is just a peek ahead to chapter

833
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
two we're only going to have a few

834
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
snippets from the medium, the meso

835
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
chapters, the space between.

836
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:14,067
But don't we see diagrams like this all

837
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
the time in active inference with

838
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
internal external blanket states, the

839
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
particular partition, hierarchical

840
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
predictive processing, Bayesian brain

841
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
architectures?

842
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:17,070
We see these diagrams all the time.

843
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:43,095
And section 2.1 is extremely provocative

844
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
with the analysis of neural circuitry and

845
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
two other types of systems in really

846
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
establishing that the drawing, if it's

847
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
informal, is insufficient to completely

848
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
convey the argument and to really

849
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:43,095
represent the situation.

850
00:38:43,096 --> 00:39:04,111
However, if we use the kind of string

851
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,111
diagrams or just diagrams more generally

852
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,111
that category theory provides, we really

853
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,111
get a graphical compositionality that

854
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,111
just drawing on a page, though obviously

855
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,111
wonderful and fun, does not reach.

856
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:26,133
And so we're going to be able to talk

857
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
about how these types of diagrams, which

858
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
again we see all over the literature, can

859
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
be enriched with this category theoretic

860
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
perspective so that we can assess, well,

861
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
what if I draw a line from this one over

862
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,133
to that one?

863
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,134
Is that valid?

864
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,136
How is that going to change the

865
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,136
properties?

866
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:41,148
And so we're going to be able to know a

867
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
lot more about that when we understand

868
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
the compositional structure via the

869
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
Bayesian lenses of these compositional

870
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
Bayesian systems.

871
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,150
Anything else to add on this slide?

872
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,154
All right.

873
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:50,157
Dean or Ali?

874
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,157
Go ahead.

875
00:39:56,162 --> 00:40:14,175
Ali: So chapter one begins with the claim

876
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
that the brain's visual circuitry seems

877
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
to be roughly hierarchical, and this

878
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
hierarchical structure is a hint of

879
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
compositionality and thus a sign that a

880
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
categorical approach may be helpful and

881
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
enlightening.

882
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:25,186
On the other hand, the underlying

883
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
equations of the free energy principle

884
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
exhibit a form of compositionality which

885
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
is used to obtain the hierarchical

886
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
models.

887
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:41,202
Despite the hint of compositionality, the

888
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
equations of motion for these

889
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
hierarchical systems are typically

890
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
derived from scratch each time a

891
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
redundant effort that would not be

892
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
required had a compositional formalism,

893
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
such as category theory being used from

894
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
the start.

895
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:50,211
So this thesis supplies such a

896
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
categorical formalism and exemplifies it

897
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
with hierarchical predictive coding under

898
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
the free energy principle.

899
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:57,218
Category theory has a rich formal

900
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
vocabulary for precisely describing

901
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
universal constructions.

902
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,215
And so not only does a categorical

903
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
formulation of.

904
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:11,226
The free energy framework promise to

905
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,226
clarify the current confusions around

906
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,226
FEP, but it may be expected also to shed

907
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,226
light on its potential universality.

908
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:16,231
Daniel: Just so exciting and

909
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
interesting.

910
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:30,245
And in terms of the current, the past,

911
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
present and future status of the free

912
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
energy principle and active inference,

913
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
it's an absolutely consequential

914
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
direction of work.

915
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,247
Dean, anything here?

916
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
Dean: No.

917
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:45,260
I know that in seven four one, which

918
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,260
we'll talk about later, the introduction

919
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,260
of the term fuzzy and fuzzy distributions

920
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,260
comes up.

921
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:51,266
So even though they're being precise,

922
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
they're being precise, their fuzziness as

923
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
well.

924
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:53,268
Daniel: Great.

925
00:41:53,268 --> 00:42:00,269
Like a high resolution picture of a fuzzy

926
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
jacket onwards.

927
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:07,276
So in this thesis, we do not get as far

928
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:07,276
as a completely general formulation of

929
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:07,276
active inference.

930
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:13,282
And it goes without saying this

931
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
expression could be added to every single

932
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
thing that we read today.

933
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:23,292
But in the coming videos and beyond,

934
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
we're going to discuss what this all

935
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
means and just one more exciting piece

936
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
from this page.

937
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:40,309
Because active inference models and the

938
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
free energy framework more broadly are

939
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
descriptions of systems that are open to

940
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
an environment, interacting with it, and

941
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
therefore situated in context, they are

942
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
particularly suited to a category

943
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
theoretic reformulation.

944
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:55,324
So that's very exciting because we've

945
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
from qualitative philosophical,

946
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
humanistic approaches and also from

947
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
statistical, numerical, formal

948
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
approaches.

949
00:42:55,324 --> 00:43:12,335
We've discussed a lot of this openness

950
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
and now we have another entree or another

951
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
vector or another toolkit rule kit, pool

952
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
kit to work with, and that is just

953
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
opening the space up a lot.

954
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,337
Ollie or Dean, want to add anything.

955
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:16,339
Dean: Here, just real quick?

956
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:18,341
We've talked in other live streams.

957
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:28,351
We've used images of ice cream cones and

958
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:28,351
ice cream trucks and what's in the

959
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:28,351
foreground and what's in the background,

960
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:28,351
what's actually the context and what is

961
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:28,351
the content.

962
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:43,366
And this reinforces that idea of as the

963
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:43,366
observer, as the one using their optic

964
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:43,366
nerves, what did you choose to put in

965
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:43,366
front and what is in behind?

966
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:51,374
And we have to keep that in mind because

967
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:51,374
we shouldn't assume that everybody

968
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:51,374
chooses the way that we do.

969
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:56,379
So, again, just making sure we understand

970
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:56,379
what's being said here in this slide.

971
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:57,380
It's really important.

972
00:43:58,381 --> 00:43:59,382
Daniel: Thank you, Ali.

973
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:15,392
Ali: Yes, and I still think it's really

974
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
clever to title the dissertation as

975
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
mathematical foundations for a

976
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
compositional account of the Bayesian

977
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
brain as opposed to active Inference.

978
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:32,409
Because, as we all know, one of the

979
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
distinguishing features of active

980
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
inference theory and what sets it apart

981
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
from other related theories such as

982
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
Bayesian brain and predictive coding

983
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
theories, is the fundamental integration

984
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
of action into perception.

985
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:56,433
So as long as this dissertation doesn't

986
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
provide a full fledged account of this

987
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
kind of action integration, I believe it

988
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
would be more appropriate to term it as a

989
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
compositional account of the Bayesian

990
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
brain and not particularly active

991
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
inference.

992
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:08,439
But of course, in chapter seven, toby

993
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
suggests some potential ways that this

994
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
kind of integration can potentially be

995
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
done in the future.

996
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,440
Research.

997
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,442
Daniel: Awesome.

998
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,443
All right.

999
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:18,449
Chapter One is already foreshadowing the

1000
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:18,449
idea of cognitive maps.

1001
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:22,453
And Toby writes current models of

1002
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:22,453
cognitive maps.

1003
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:27,458
Some are expressed in the language of

1004
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:27,458
approximate variational inference.

1005
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,460
We talk about that a lot.

1006
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,464
Some are expressed in the language of

1007
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
reinforcement learning.

1008
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,467
Some attempt to combine the two.

1009
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:41,472
We expect that the foundations developed

1010
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:41,472
here will help us unify these accounts.

1011
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,475
So how can we be reimagining?

1012
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:44,475
Maps?

1013
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,479
Cognitive maps?

1014
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,480
Aren't they all?

1015
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,484
Alir, Dean, anything else to add here?

1016
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:03,488
All right, and last few selections from

1017
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
chapter One.

1018
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:05,490
Either of you, please.

1019
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,491
What's the first take?

1020
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:07,492
Here?

1021
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:14,499
I'll go first.

1022
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:22,507
Our primary motivation in writing this

1023
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
thesis is to lay the groundwork for well

1024
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
typed cognitive science and computational

1025
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
neuroscience.

1026
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:32,517
It's a very interesting topic about the

1027
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
implications of well typing and what does

1028
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:32,517
it mean for something to be well typed?

1029
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:38,522
What is a programming language or a

1030
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:38,522
scientific culture or a framework that's

1031
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:38,522
well piped?

1032
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:49,534
The free energy framework, like the

1033
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:49,534
structurally adjacent framework of

1034
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:49,534
compositional game theory, has a strong

1035
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:49,534
flavor of teleology what is that taste

1036
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:49,534
like?

1037
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:55,540
And systems act in order to make their

1038
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
predictions come true.

1039
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,544
We come to this so many times and in so

1040
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
many ways.

1041
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:25,564
In reinforcement or reward oriented

1042
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
learning, you have a reward function, and

1043
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
systems work to maximize reward, whereas

1044
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
in free energy as a bounding variable or

1045
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
functional on surprise, the imperative is

1046
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
to bound and reduce surprise such that

1047
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
expectations or preferences are

1048
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
realized.

1049
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:28,567
And so here it's expressed

1050
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:28,567
qualitatively.

1051
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:44,583
We've approached this in many different

1052
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:44,583
paper discussions from a statistical,

1053
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:44,583
numerical, formal, analytical angle, and

1054
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:44,583
here we're approaching it from another

1055
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:44,583
formal avenue of category theory.

1056
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:51,590
And either of you have any comments on

1057
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
this or want to talk about the last

1058
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
piece?

1059
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,593
Dean: Yeah, I'll talk quickly about

1060
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:54,593
scientific faith.

1061
00:47:54,593 --> 00:48:04,597
In the programming that I did, we had a

1062
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
little axiom or expression that was, if

1063
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
it isn't history, then it's a mystery.

1064
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:09,602
And I think that's part of what this

1065
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:09,602
scientific faith piece is all about.

1066
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:22,614
I mean, if you have some data, if you

1067
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:22,614
have some way of recording or taking in

1068
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:22,614
or gaining some sense of, that's great,

1069
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:22,614
that's the historical part.

1070
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:31,624
But you still also need that curiosity

1071
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:31,624
and that sense that there is yet still to

1072
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:31,624
be witnessed and observed.

1073
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:35,628
And you have to have some faith that

1074
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:35,628
sticking around is going to be able to

1075
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:35,628
provide that opportunity.

1076
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:46,639
I don't know if a well typed science will

1077
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:46,639
buttress scientific faith.

1078
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,643
I think sometimes the personality

1079
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
matters.

1080
00:48:50,643 --> 00:49:10,657
I think if you're the kind of person who

1081
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
believes in curiosity being resolved and

1082
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
wayfinding being a really good strategy

1083
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
to find out who you are and what the

1084
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
world is about, I think that's the faith

1085
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
piece that some of us just seem to carry

1086
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:10,657
around, whether we like it or not.

1087
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,660
Daniel: Awesome.

1088
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,664
Ali, anything on this slide or enclosure

1089
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:17,664
of chapter one?

1090
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:28,675
Ali: Just wanted to mention that by well

1091
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:28,675
typed cognitive science, or more

1092
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:28,675
generally, well typed science.

1093
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:42,689
I believe Toby somehow implying a kind of

1094
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:42,689
more or less claim for disunity of

1095
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:42,689
sciences as opposed to a unified vision

1096
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:42,689
of science.

1097
00:49:42,689 --> 00:50:09,710
Because you see, in the unified vision

1098
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:09,710
for science, every explanatory models and

1099
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:09,710
every theory can theoretically be unified

1100
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:09,710
within an overarching principle or

1101
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:09,710
overarching theory, which has not been

1102
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:09,710
discovered yet.

1103
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:15,716
But some philosophers advocate the

1104
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
position of disunity of sciences.

1105
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:34,735
In other words, although there are some

1106
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
commonalities between every scientific

1107
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
areas, but there are some individual

1108
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
types, or individual concepts, if you

1109
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
will, that cannot be taken.

1110
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:47,748
I mean, this individuality cannot be

1111
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
taken for granted simply by just

1112
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
explaining it away, by proposing some

1113
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
unifying principle.

1114
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:59,760
So in this sense, well typed science is

1115
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,760
quite a rigorous and individualized

1116
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,760
notion of scientific endeavor, at least

1117
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,760
in my opinion.

1118
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,758
But I'm curious to know Toby's opinion.

1119
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:16,771
Daniel: I'll just add one more comment on

1120
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
the well typed in programming languages

1121
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
where type safety or type soundness is

1122
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
being described as a beneficial feature

1123
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
in certain contexts.

1124
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:30,785
Obviously, people point to the way that a

1125
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:30,785
well typed language can prevent illegal

1126
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:30,785
operations or use safer handling of short

1127
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:30,785
term memory, working memory, and avert

1128
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:30,785
logical errors.

1129
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:44,799
So it's very interesting to think about

1130
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
what that means in science in terms of

1131
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
not just the reproducibility of

1132
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
experimentation, but in terms of what

1133
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
experiments and what research avenues are

1134
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
pursued overall, as well as even

1135
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
cognitive security.

1136
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:54,809
So there's so many different angles where

1137
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:54,809
well typing is going to matter for the

1138
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:54,809
way that we think about compositional,

1139
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:54,809
cognitive cartography, which we're going

1140
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:54,809
to come to.

1141
00:51:54,809 --> 00:52:00,809
Now, chapter seven, we skipped over a few

1142
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:00,809
pieces, didn't we?

1143
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:02,811
That's how the last six months felt.

1144
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:03,812
Dean: It was 9900.

1145
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:04,813
Yeah.

1146
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:15,824
Daniel: I'll hold on the jokes for now,

1147
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
but yeah, we skipped about 200 pages

1148
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
right there.

1149
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:20,829
That's the part that you want to take

1150
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:20,829
lightly.

1151
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,831
That's the bottom of the bathtub.

1152
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,834
You jump into chapter one and it's

1153
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:25,834
exciting.

1154
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:26,835
It's like skiing downhill.

1155
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:38,847
And then this vast tundra opens of

1156
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
chapters two through six, which again was

1157
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
the last half year for us and several

1158
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
others.

1159
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:46,855
So now let's get to chapter seven, and

1160
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:46,855
then the sandwich will be dissected with

1161
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:46,855
Toby.

1162
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
Okay.

1163
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:56,865
With absolute humility and accuracy, toby

1164
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
points to three prominent shortcomings of

1165
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
the thesis.

1166
00:52:56,865 --> 00:53:00,863
Ali, do you want to summarize these three

1167
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:00,863
shortcomings?

1168
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:02,865
Ali: Sure.

1169
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:11,874
So the first one is that the notion of

1170
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
approximate inference doctrine should be

1171
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
tested with further exemplification.

1172
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:20,883
In other words, specifically with the

1173
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:20,883
problem of double counting, which is

1174
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:20,883
addressed in chapter six.

1175
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:37,900
The other one is that the general models

1176
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,900
that Toby is considered in this

1177
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,900
dissertation are somehow static despite

1178
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,900
its application in modeling dynamical

1179
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,900
systems.

1180
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,905
So again, this problem is addressed.

1181
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:57,920
I mean, some suggestions for overcoming

1182
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
this shortcoming is addressed in this

1183
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
chapter, specifically in relation to

1184
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Meyer's Categorical theory of dynamical

1185
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
systems.

1186
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:11,928
And finally, although we consider lower

1187
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
level neural circuit models, we did not

1188
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
explicitly connect our approximate

1189
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
inference doctrines to these more

1190
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
biological models.

1191
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:30,947
So in other words, it's not a theory for

1192
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
modeling the whole Iguana, it's just a

1193
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
modeling framework for modeling a very

1194
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
specific function or the cognitive

1195
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
function of the brain.

1196
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:37,954
Dean: I don't know that knowing your

1197
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
limits should be considered a

1198
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
shortcoming.

1199
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:41,958
That's just philosophical me going

1200
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:41,958
knowing.

1201
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:47,964
Okay, so of the three of us, I'm the one

1202
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:47,964
guy who's proud to say I get it wrong 20%

1203
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:47,964
of the time.

1204
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:52,969
I don't give a rat's backside most often

1205
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:52,969
about precision and perfection.

1206
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:53,970
I want to try.

1207
00:54:53,970 --> 00:55:06,977
And so if somebody says, well, the thing

1208
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
that I'm talking about here has its

1209
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
limits and it's not going to solve all

1210
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
the problems of the world, I just think

1211
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
that's being realistic and honest.

1212
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:14,985
So call it shortcomings, I see it as a

1213
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
bit of a feature, being self aware of not

1214
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
being able to do everything at once.

1215
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:21,992
Daniel: Yeah, so often in papers it's

1216
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:21,992
apologetic when it's actually the

1217
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:21,992
adjacent possible.

1218
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:25,996
And there's always an adjacent possible,

1219
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
indeed an expanding one.

1220
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:40,010
So to make an exponentially expansive

1221
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,010
apology rather than pointing to the

1222
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,010
adjacent possible and seeing what can

1223
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,010
become is just two sides of the same coin

1224
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,010
with a third side being the rim on that

1225
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,010
coin.

1226
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:47,018
7.1 structured worlds and 7.1.1 Bayesian

1227
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:47,018
sensor fusion.

1228
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:49,020
Ollie, how do you see sensor fusion?

1229
00:55:53,024 --> 00:56:16,041
Ali: Yes, so sensor fusion is a situation

1230
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
where one has a number of sensors which

1231
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
report spatially situated data and also

1232
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
it's kind of a problem of combining the

1233
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
local data with the global data.

1234
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:44,069
So in category theory there is an obvious

1235
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
choice for addressing this particular

1236
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
problem, namely the notion of sheets,

1237
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
which is a spatially coherent data type,

1238
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
something like a bundle for which local

1239
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
sections can always be uniquely glued

1240
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
together into a global section, as Toby

1241
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
described here.

1242
00:56:44,069 --> 00:57:02,081
And it reminds me of the theory of, I

1243
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
mean the derivation of the duality

1244
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
between FEP and CMEP in Bayesian

1245
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
mechanics paper by deploying these

1246
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
notions of bundles.

1247
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:20,099
So in other sense, sheath theory and the

1248
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
related fields of applied topology and

1249
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
chromology allow us to judge when it is

1250
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
possible to form a consensus and quantify

1251
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
the obstructions to the formation of

1252
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
consensus.

1253
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:38,116
Hence, the consensus between FEP and CMAP

1254
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:38,116
as done in Bayesian mechanics paper, I

1255
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:38,116
believe is done in the same sense of

1256
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:38,116
sheath theory as providing a possibility

1257
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:38,116
for emerging such a consensus.

1258
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:49,128
And also missing from the current chief

1259
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:49,128
theoretic understanding of sensor fusion

1260
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:49,128
is a thorough treatment of belief and

1261
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:49,128
uncertainty, especially from a Bayesian

1262
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:49,128
perspective.

1263
00:57:50,129 --> 00:58:05,138
A first possible extension of the work

1264
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
presented here is to extend statistical

1265
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
gains and approximate and approximate

1266
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
inference doctrines and hence the classes

1267
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
of model that they encompass, to

1268
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
structured data types such as sheets.

1269
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:12,145
We expect that the first step will be to

1270
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
consider categories of channels between

1271
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
sheeps.

1272
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:14,147
Daniel: Awesome.

1273
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:27,160
And just to give a more mundane or

1274
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
empirical example of sensor fusion, what

1275
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
if we have many EEG sensors on a head and

1276
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
we need to synthesize into one joint

1277
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
representation?

1278
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:34,167
Or what if we have temperature sensors

1279
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:34,167
across an agricultural field and humidity

1280
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:34,167
sensors?

1281
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:43,176
How this happens is called sensor fusion,

1282
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:43,176
and category theory is helping us

1283
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:43,176
understand the compositionality of such

1284
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:43,176
issues.

1285
00:58:44,176 --> 00:58:53,186
Dean: Dean yeah, I just want to focus in

1286
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
on bullet number two here, because,

1287
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
Daniel, both you and Allie, I think

1288
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
you're absolutely correct.

1289
00:58:53,186 --> 00:59:03,190
I think where they say something like a

1290
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
bundle for which local sections can

1291
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
always be uniquely glued together into a

1292
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
global section.

1293
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:11,198
Well, of course they can, but I don't

1294
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:11,198
know that that's necessarily the magic

1295
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:11,198
what if in a counterfactual sense.

1296
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:12,199
What if they are glued?

1297
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,203
Is that something we must commit to?

1298
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:33,220
And then if it is going to be glued

1299
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
together into some sort of global

1300
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
composition, when that timing of when to

1301
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
do that, I also think is something that

1302
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
we judge.

1303
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:42,229
So is that the data set, the what if and

1304
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:42,229
the when, is that the data set that we're

1305
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:42,229
going to eventually bump into?

1306
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:44,231
I would argue yes.

1307
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:50,237
Does that mean we're going to have to

1308
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:50,237
pass through that moment and come out on

1309
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:50,237
the other side of it, hopefully still

1310
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:50,237
intact?

1311
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:54,241
Yes, to me, that is consensus building.

1312
00:59:55,242 --> 01:00:01,065
So I know that that's one little sentence

1313
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:01,065
in a 200 page paper.

1314
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:22,360
But again, there are so many nuggets in

1315
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
this paper where if you just slow down

1316
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
and read it and think about what the

1317
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
implications of what they're saying are,

1318
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
you could literally go off right there on

1319
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
that one sentence and spend hours trying

1320
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
to figure out, okay, so really, what

1321
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,360
should we be doing with this?

1322
01:00:22,362 --> 01:00:24,508
Is this a priority?

1323
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:24,595
Whatever.

1324
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:26,741
Daniel: Awesome.

1325
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:40,186
Continuing on to address that first

1326
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:40,186
shortcoming, we already mentioned

1327
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:40,186
Sheaves, and we hope that these tools

1328
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:40,186
will suggest new connections to work on

1329
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:40,186
quantum theoretic formulations of the

1330
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:40,186
free energy framework.

1331
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,561
That's something we've discussed in

1332
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:44,561
several stream series.

1333
01:00:44,576 --> 01:01:06,171
Livestream 17 with Chris Fields on

1334
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
information flow in context dependent

1335
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
hierarchical Bayesian inference,

1336
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
Livestream 40 with Friston, Levin,

1337
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
Glazebrook and Fields on a free energy

1338
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
principle for generic quantum systems and

1339
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
the ongoing Chris Fields course, Physics

1340
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,171
as Information Processing 2023.

1341
01:01:06,185 --> 01:01:27,209
So category theory and adjacent tools are

1342
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
already widely utilized in quantum

1343
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
sciences, quantum information science,

1344
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
more broadly, quantum computation, and so

1345
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
on one hand, we see the quantum and free

1346
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
energy principle synthesis outlined in

1347
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:27,209
these stream series.

1348
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:34,900
And here we have the category theory,

1349
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:34,900
active inference, Bayesian brain, free

1350
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:34,900
energy principle synthesis.

1351
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:39,489
So all three category theory, quantum and

1352
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:39,489
FEP walk into a sheath.

1353
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:41,679
What do they say?

1354
01:01:43,836 --> 01:01:52,071
All right, Ali, what is a summary or

1355
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:52,071
overview on learning structure and

1356
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:52,071
structured learning?

1357
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:56,119
Ali: Yes.

1358
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:04,132
So an interesting distinction is provided

1359
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:04,132
right at the beginning between structured

1360
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:04,132
learning and learning structure.

1361
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:12,211
So structured learning, at least Toby,

1362
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:12,211
means extending the process of learning

1363
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:12,211
to a structured setting.

1364
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:17,259
But by learning structure, he means

1365
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:17,259
learning the underlying structures

1366
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:17,259
themselves.

1367
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:29,386
So in the categorical semantics of

1368
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:29,386
dependent type theory, the context is

1369
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:29,386
witnessed by the object over which a

1370
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:29,386
slice category is defined.

1371
01:02:29,388 --> 01:02:38,475
And in so in some sense it defines the

1372
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:38,475
shape of the universe by the growth in

1373
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:38,475
the construction.

1374
01:02:38,477 --> 01:02:44,534
There is correspondence between sheaves

1375
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:44,534
and certain bundles as objects of slice

1376
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:44,534
categories.

1377
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:51,602
And so we can think of structured

1378
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:51,602
inference and learning as taking place in

1379
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:51,602
appropriate slice categories.

1380
01:02:51,603 --> 01:03:02,655
So both of those somehow address the

1381
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:02,655
binary concepts of structured learning

1382
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:02,655
and learning structure in a complementary

1383
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:02,655
way.

1384
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:09,721
So we can think of bundle morphisms as

1385
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:09,721
generalized parameters maps.

1386
01:03:09,723 --> 01:03:16,795
And in that case, the problem of learning

1387
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:16,795
structure then becomes a problem of

1388
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:16,795
generalized parameter learning.

1389
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:30,932
And this is the way that some

1390
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:30,932
reinforcement learning techniques have

1391
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:30,932
been deployed by using this kind of

1392
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:30,932
generalized parameter learning.

1393
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:47,102
So we expect this line of inquiry to

1394
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
clarify the relationships between our

1395
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
formalism of approximate inference and

1396
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
other related work on the categorical

1397
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
foundations of cybernetics which have

1398
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
typically been studied in a differential

1399
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
rather than probabilistic setting.

1400
01:03:47,107 --> 01:03:59,223
We expect the connection to be made by

1401
01:03:59,223 --> 01:03:59,223
information geometry where Bayesian

1402
01:03:59,223 --> 01:03:59,223
inference can be understood both using

1403
01:03:59,223 --> 01:03:59,223
gradient descent and as a kind of

1404
01:03:59,223 --> 01:03:59,223
parallel transport.

1405
01:03:59,224 --> 01:04:23,400
In other words, it is a way to unify both

1406
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,400
the physical formulation of physical

1407
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,400
formulation of system as done through the

1408
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,400
differential equations in cybernetics and

1409
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,400
also the probabilistic formulation of the

1410
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,400
systems as done in Bayesian mechanics.

1411
01:04:24,412 --> 01:04:25,420
Daniel: Awesome.

1412
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:26,439
Just two quick notes on this.

1413
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:29,462
First, the growth and deak construction.

1414
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:51,684
Shauna Dobson spoke about this in the

1415
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
Math Art Guest Stream in the context of

1416
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
the evolution of art and other areas in

1417
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
math and philosophy over the last hundred

1418
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
years with this progressive

1419
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
swarmification sheafification of self.

1420
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:53,703
So that's really cool to see.

1421
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,750
And then we expect the connection to be

1422
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:58,750
made.

1423
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:07,788
What we expect is what we prefer, and

1424
01:05:07,788 --> 01:05:07,788
then what we expect prefer is shaping our

1425
01:05:07,788 --> 01:05:07,788
action selection to realize it.

1426
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:25,966
So again, once we, as mentioned earlier,

1427
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
understand that systems act in order to

1428
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
make their expectations realized, we see

1429
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
that these kinds of expressions are more

1430
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
than just the expression of a belief,

1431
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
they're also in some ways an action

1432
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:25,966
imperative.

1433
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:28,996
Dean, any thoughts?

1434
01:05:29,003 --> 01:05:47,189
Dean: I could go for days on this

1435
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
section, of course, but I will say this

1436
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
who knew there was so much to be loaded

1437
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
up between the difference of a verb tense

1438
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
right structure and structured added D

1439
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
and all of a sudden we're discretized

1440
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:47,189
between process and product.

1441
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:54,251
I'll just start there and wait for Toby

1442
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:54,251
to come on because I could literally have

1443
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:54,251
a field day.

1444
01:05:54,251 --> 01:06:02,272
I'm at the circus, the carnival and every

1445
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:02,272
single theme park in the world when it

1446
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:02,272
comes to this stuff.

1447
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,305
Daniel: It's awesome.

1448
01:06:05,306 --> 01:06:16,410
All right, now we get to seven one three

1449
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:16,410
compositional, cognitive, cartography

1450
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:16,410
sailing, the three C's.

1451
01:06:16,412 --> 01:06:19,446
Ali, what is this section about?

1452
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:40,652
Ali: Okay, so this is mainly addresses

1453
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:40,652
the success of representation and I mean

1454
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:40,652
doing a kind of a comparison between

1455
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:40,652
successive representation and other

1456
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:40,652
cognitive map theories.

1457
01:06:41,663 --> 01:07:00,795
In other words, the topus theoretic

1458
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
developments sketched so far may provide

1459
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
a suitable setting in which to understand

1460
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
the neural basis for navigation and help

1461
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
explain how, ostensibly spatial

1462
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
navigation processes and circuits are

1463
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
invariably involved in more abstract

1464
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:00,795
problem solving.

1465
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:13,920
Atopos is not only a richly structured

1466
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:13,920
category of spaces or spatial types, but

1467
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:13,920
it can also be understood as a category

1468
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:13,920
as a categorified space itself.

1469
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:29,088
But an important notion here is that

1470
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:29,088
under the free energy principle, there's

1471
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:29,088
a close relationship between beliefs

1472
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:29,088
about the geometry of an environment and

1473
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:29,088
beliefs about expected future

1474
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:29,088
trajectories in that environment.

1475
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:44,236
So this is basically the idea behind

1476
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:44,236
successor representation of the cognitive

1477
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:44,236
map, which says roughly that the brain's

1478
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:44,236
representation of where it is is

1479
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:44,236
equivalently a representation of where it

1480
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:44,236
soon expects to be.

1481
01:07:44,237 --> 01:07:59,382
So under the free energy principle, and

1482
01:07:59,382 --> 01:07:59,382
similarly, under the successor

1483
01:07:59,382 --> 01:07:59,382
representation, the expected dynamics is

1484
01:07:59,382 --> 01:07:59,382
a geodesic flow, which is determined by

1485
01:07:59,382 --> 01:07:59,382
beliefs about the spatial geometry.

1486
01:08:00,331 --> 01:08:05,382
But crucially, these beliefs are not a

1487
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:05,382
static.

1488
01:08:05,384 --> 01:08:10,433
They depend on what the agent believes

1489
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:10,433
will happen.

1490
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:16,497
And this has been suggested as an

1491
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:16,497
explanation for the predictive nature of

1492
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:16,497
the cognitive map.

1493
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:44,772
In other words, if we don't take into

1494
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
consideration the uncertainty behind the

1495
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
information available to the agent, then

1496
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
we wouldn't get to formalize the behavior

1497
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
in a truly predictive way, because

1498
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
obviously there isn't any uncertainty to

1499
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
predict about and then compare the

1500
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
prediction with the actual data.

1501
01:08:44,773 --> 01:08:54,877
The cognitive map has its central locus

1502
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:54,877
in the hippocampus, which we may

1503
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:54,877
therefore understand as representing the

1504
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:54,877
base space over which the big topus is

1505
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:54,877
sliced.

1506
01:08:54,878 --> 01:09:07,948
And since changes of plan seem therefore

1507
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:07,948
to induce changes of base, we might see

1508
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:07,948
the functional connectivity of the brain

1509
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:07,948
as witnessing this mathematical

1510
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:07,948
structure.

1511
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:22,093
And this particular claim, I believe, is

1512
01:09:22,093 --> 01:09:22,093
maps perhaps perfectly onto Boujaki's

1513
01:09:22,093 --> 01:09:22,093
theory of brain from inside out.

1514
01:09:22,094 --> 01:09:54,418
So Boujaki provides a kind of theory that

1515
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
sets the hippocampus as the agential

1516
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
center of all the cognitive tests that

1517
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
needs to be reconstructed from inside

1518
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
out, as opposed to just processing the

1519
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
coming data in a kind of purely

1520
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:54,418
computational unidirectional way.

1521
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:07,484
Daniel: We talked a lot about, and

1522
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:07,484
certainly will in the coming weeks, about

1523
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:07,484
what is witnessing, how is witness

1524
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:07,484
related to observation, but we'll come

1525
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:07,484
back to that.

1526
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:26,672
Okay, continuing on, on the compositional

1527
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
cognitive cartography, there's some

1528
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
discussion about the internal universe of

1529
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
the topos, not just the Topos institute,

1530
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
but the concept and the way that the

1531
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
representations of the cognitive map are

1532
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:26,672
inherently context dependent.

1533
01:10:26,674 --> 01:10:35,768
Therefore, it fits naturally within the

1534
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
subjectivist metaphysics implied by the

1535
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
free energy framework, a topic that I

1536
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
know Ali is extremely interested in.

1537
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:40,814
And Dean Ali, any other comments on

1538
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:40,814
this?

1539
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:41,827
Slice?

1540
01:10:44,856 --> 01:10:49,899
Maybe we can start calling them a slice

1541
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:49,899
or a bundle instead of a slide.

1542
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:56,974
Dean: Well, if we do go the slice route,

1543
01:10:56,974 --> 01:10:56,974
one thing I would just pause for a

1544
01:10:56,974 --> 01:10:56,974
second.

1545
01:10:57,986 --> 01:11:12,077
I think for most people, in context,

1546
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
geometry or geometric stability is

1547
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
usually the association, whereas geodesic

1548
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
flow, which was mentioned in the last

1549
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
slide is a lot more dynamic.

1550
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:27,228
And I think that if we're going to talk

1551
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:27,228
about a composition like the flow of the

1552
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:27,228
piece of music that's now playing out, we

1553
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:27,228
have to think of this as both framed and

1554
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:27,228
filtered.

1555
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:51,461
And so these sheaves allow for that sense

1556
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
of distribution, that movement part, I

1557
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
think, metaphorically of exploitation and

1558
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
exploration now being the two passengers

1559
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
in the HOV Lane and HOV Lanes in North

1560
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
America at least, are designated by a

1561
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:51,461
diamond.

1562
01:11:51,462 --> 01:12:10,590
So you can see how the geometry and the

1563
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:10,590
geodesic again can all be put together,

1564
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:10,590
and you're starting to build a picture in

1565
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:10,590
these different models and maps that you

1566
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:10,590
may be constructing great.

1567
01:12:10,597 --> 01:12:21,708
Daniel: 7.2 societies of Systems I'll

1568
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:21,708
just say that a collection of purely

1569
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:21,708
passive agents is no society at all.

1570
01:12:22,712 --> 01:12:26,752
What would it even be, Ali?

1571
01:12:26,752 --> 01:12:32,811
Want to add anything more on the forwards

1572
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:32,811
and backwards, perhaps, and the

1573
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:32,811
compositional structure?

1574
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:54,033
Ali: Well, first of all, I wanted to just

1575
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,033
point that the very first sentence here,

1576
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,033
a collection of purely passive agents is

1577
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,033
no society also applies to one of my

1578
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,033
favorite metaphysical theories out there,

1579
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,033
namely the assemblage theory.

1580
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:59,088
So we can say that a collection of purely

1581
01:12:59,088 --> 01:12:59,088
passive agents is no assemblage as well.

1582
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:07,103
But in any case, the doctrines of

1583
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:07,103
approximate inference introduced in this

1584
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:07,103
thesis are inherently perceptual.

1585
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:37,401
But the forward channel of a statistical

1586
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
gain points towards the environment

1587
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
predicting the expected incoming sense

1588
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
data, whereas the backwards channel

1589
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
points from the environment into the

1590
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
agent, terminating in the agent's most

1591
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
causally abstract beliefs one way in

1592
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
which we can incorporate action and

1593
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
thereby shape the framework of this

1594
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
thesis into a framework for active

1595
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:37,401
inference.

1596
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:46,492
The forwards channel should predict not

1597
01:13:46,492 --> 01:13:46,492
only sense data incoming from the

1598
01:13:46,492 --> 01:13:46,492
environment, but also the actions to be

1599
01:13:46,492 --> 01:13:46,492
taken by the agent.

1600
01:13:46,493 --> 01:14:13,709
So up until now in the dissertation, he

1601
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:13,709
has provided in quite elaborate detail

1602
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:13,709
how this kind of formulation of the bi

1603
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:13,709
directional channels can be used to

1604
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:13,709
reframe the perceptual side of active

1605
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:13,709
inference.

1606
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:22,793
But as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't go

1607
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:22,793
so far as to integrate the action into

1608
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:22,793
this framework as well.

1609
01:14:22,794 --> 01:14:39,965
But of course, here is a potential way

1610
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:39,965
forward which we can deploy the same

1611
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:39,965
forward channel as being the actions to

1612
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:39,965
be taken by the environment because of

1613
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:39,965
the same directionality it possesses.

1614
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:53,106
We therefore expect the compositional

1615
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:53,106
theory of active inference to have

1616
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:53,106
forwards channel rather so that an

1617
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:53,106
agent's sensorium depends on the

1618
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:53,106
configuration or quote unquote action

1619
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:53,106
that it has chosen.

1620
01:14:54,112 --> 01:15:27,384
And another very, in my opinion,

1621
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
significant point here is the

1622
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
substitution of the notion of markup

1623
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
blankets throughout the whole

1624
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
dissertation with the notion of

1625
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
polynomial fontors, because, as have been

1626
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
discussed in the previous chapters as

1627
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
well, Markov blanket doesn't provide a

1628
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
rigorous enough concept to be applied

1629
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
quite at least directly in category

1630
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:27,384
theory.

1631
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:43,540
So polynomial functions substitute the

1632
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,540
well known notion of markup blanket as

1633
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,540
used in active inference literature to

1634
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,540
characterize basically the same thing or

1635
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,540
the interaction boundaries of adaptive

1636
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,540
agents.

1637
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,570
Daniel: Yes, so many great pieces here.

1638
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:59,707
Markup blanket used in the informal

1639
01:15:59,707 --> 01:15:59,707
active inference literature, like

1640
01:15:59,707 --> 01:15:59,707
everything we've been studying for the

1641
01:15:59,707 --> 01:15:59,707
last few years, all of that casual light,

1642
01:15:59,707 --> 01:15:59,707
airy, breezy we had fun.

1643
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:02,673
Now it's time to formalize that.

1644
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:09,745
And there's so much more we can say about

1645
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:09,745
backwards and forwards, but we'll just

1646
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:09,745
carry on.

1647
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:27,920
7.21 active Inference there are some

1648
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:27,920
mentions about the resemblance between

1649
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:27,920
active inference and economic games in

1650
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:27,920
terms of they're both having lenses into

1651
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:27,920
the area or the arena of interaction.

1652
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:33,983
And this line of inquiry naturally leads

1653
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:33,983
onto the consideration of multi agent

1654
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:33,983
systems.

1655
01:16:33,985 --> 01:16:36,018
Perhaps this can be investigated with

1656
01:16:36,018 --> 01:16:36,018
poly algebras.

1657
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:41,064
7.2.2 what is the type of a plan?

1658
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:51,161
Perception and action are thus in

1659
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:51,161
general, the two dual ways in which a

1660
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:51,161
system can minimize its free energy

1661
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:51,161
change your mind, change the world.

1662
01:16:51,164 --> 01:17:09,282
Akin to the two degrees of freedom

1663
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:09,282
available in an autoencoder game

1664
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:09,282
discussed in the thesis a system that

1665
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:09,282
acts must necessarily be motivated

1666
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:09,282
towards some goal and in order to realize

1667
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:09,282
its goal, the system must enact a plan.

1668
01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:12,313
Dean, pick it up from here.

1669
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,408
Dean: Well, I will just say this I'm not

1670
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:21,408
going to speak to the stuff on the slide

1671
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:21,408
necessarily.

1672
01:17:21,409 --> 01:17:30,493
At the very end of this section, Toby

1673
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:30,493
writes this prompts us to ask what is the

1674
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:30,493
form of this data and how can we

1675
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:30,493
incorporate it into the compositional

1676
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:30,493
framework?

1677
01:17:30,494 --> 01:17:33,522
In other words, what is the type of a

1678
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:33,522
plan?

1679
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:38,576
These seem to us to be key questions for

1680
01:17:38,576 --> 01:17:38,576
future work.

1681
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:46,653
This prompted me to go and then we wonder

1682
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:46,653
why teachers struggle sometimes to

1683
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:46,653
necessarily remember what it was like to

1684
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:46,653
be the learner.

1685
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:48,678
Because we can come up with a plan.

1686
01:17:48,678 --> 01:17:49,688
Because we've done the learning.

1687
01:17:49,688 --> 01:17:51,707
We're now the learned, right?

1688
01:17:52,714 --> 01:18:02,756
The learner now changes because of one

1689
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:02,756
tense present to past tense change.

1690
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:09,822
Or why the plan that we put before

1691
01:18:09,822 --> 01:18:09,822
learners removes all the critical work

1692
01:18:09,822 --> 01:18:09,822
for self organizing.

1693
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:12,854
This is the cost of being a teacher.

1694
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:25,981
Because if we do the planning for

1695
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:25,981
somebody and I understand why we have to

1696
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:25,981
do it, because if they're walking into a

1697
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:25,981
space, we don't want them falling off

1698
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:25,981
jumping off cliffs necessarily and not

1699
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:25,981
having a soft landing.

1700
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:48,021
However, we do need to talk a little bit

1701
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
about what is the type of a plan and what

1702
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
are the benefits and the costs of

1703
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
choosing to use that strategy going

1704
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
forward, especially if we're in the role

1705
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
of somebody who's supposed to be guiding,

1706
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
opening up worlds, horizons and all that

1707
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:48,021
other stuff.

1708
01:18:49,022 --> 01:18:50,023
Daniel: Thank you.

1709
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:53,026
Ollie, any other comments on this

1710
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:53,026
section?

1711
01:18:55,028 --> 01:18:57,030
Ali: Not at the moment.

1712
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:11,038
Daniel: One piece to me is it seems

1713
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
unnecessarily crude to hide all of this

1714
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
data, which is described as a lot of

1715
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
data, inside of a single undifferentiated

1716
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
choice of prior distributions.

1717
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:24,051
So that's very interesting in light of,

1718
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
again, the statistical, numerical,

1719
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
quantitative way that we've approached

1720
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
policy selection as inference planning as

1721
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
inference action and inference.

1722
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:28,055
What does it mean to differentiate this

1723
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
choice?

1724
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:34,061
Okay, reinforcement learning, open games

1725
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:34,061
and ecosystems.

1726
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:37,064
Ali, any summary here?

1727
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:59,086
Ali: Okay, so as also indicated in the

1728
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
first sentence, there is a close

1729
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
relationship between active inference

1730
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
theory, markup decision problems and

1731
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
reinforcement learning as explored

1732
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
numerous times before in many papers.

1733
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:17,098
But the standard algorithm for gaining an

1734
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
optimality for policy selection is

1735
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
usually called backward induction in

1736
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
reinforcement learning, or Akas dynamic

1737
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
programming.

1738
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:38,119
So namely, backward induction is

1739
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
structured according to a similar bi

1740
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
directional pattern, or the optic pattern

1741
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
to that of both Bayesian inference and

1742
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
reverse differentiation, and that MDPs

1743
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
themselves fit into the associated

1744
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:38,119
general framework of open games.

1745
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:52,133
So in the informal active inference

1746
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,133
approach to MDPs, the system in question

1747
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,133
counterfactually evaluates policies using

1748
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,133
a backward induction like process,

1749
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,133
accumulating free energies in order to

1750
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,133
score them.

1751
01:20:53,134 --> 01:21:08,143
Now, in this process, it is this process

1752
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:08,143
that results in the prior that we're all

1753
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:08,143
familiar with in active inference

1754
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:08,143
context, which is then updated by the

1755
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:08,143
agents inference process.

1756
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:42,177
But future work will need to untangle

1757
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
this not of interrelated bi directional

1758
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
process, in other words, how we can

1759
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
explicitly determine in what way those

1760
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
kinds of processes, although being quite

1761
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
in a quite different opposite

1762
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
directionality, can be unified into a

1763
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:42,177
unified framework.

1764
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:59,194
So we hope that having done so, we will

1765
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
show how the whole picture emerges and

1766
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
how it relates to the developing

1767
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
geometric or diegetic framework in

1768
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
categorical cybernetics, possibly

1769
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
involving the further development of our

1770
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
notion of cilia.

1771
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:03,192
Daniel: Great.

1772
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:10,199
Continuing on with reinforcement

1773
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:10,199
learning, open games, and ecosystems.

1774
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:30,219
Since the free energy principle

1775
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
underlying active inference asserts a

1776
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
certain informal universality, we might

1777
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
also hope that the satisfactory

1778
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
development of compositional active

1779
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
inference might exhibit a universal

1780
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
property that any other doctrine of

1781
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
cybernetic systems factors uniquely

1782
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:30,219
through it.

1783
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:38,227
There's some discussion of multiagent

1784
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:38,227
systems and their implied global search.

1785
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:49,238
Casting this account into the emerging

1786
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:49,238
framework of compositional active

1787
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:49,238
inference will point towards a bridge to

1788
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:49,238
multiagent reinforcement learning.

1789
01:22:50,239 --> 01:23:01,244
The resulting general account of

1790
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
multiagent intelligence will encompass

1791
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
both reinforcement learning and active

1792
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
inference, allowing us to understand

1793
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
their relative strengths and difference.

1794
01:23:02,245 --> 01:23:13,256
We hope that one distal outcome of the

1795
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:13,256
work will be a new and beneficial

1796
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:13,256
understanding of corporate activity,

1797
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:13,256
sometimes called organizational

1798
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:13,256
cybernetics or metagovernance.

1799
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:24,267
We should expect any framework resulting

1800
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:24,267
from this work to capture existing models

1801
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:24,267
of collective active inference, such as

1802
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:24,267
recent work on spin glasses or ant

1803
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:24,267
colonies.

1804
01:23:25,268 --> 01:23:26,269
Any other thoughts on this?

1805
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:48,291
Dean: Yes, Dean, I know that this is my

1806
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:48,291
biases literally on the surface, but I

1807
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:48,291
believe that the idea of open games and

1808
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:48,291
opened P-E-N-E-D ecosystems is a future

1809
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:48,291
path that a lot of formalized and

1810
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:48,291
structured learning is going to take.

1811
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:52,295
It's the work that I did essentially for

1812
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:52,295
ten years.

1813
01:23:52,295 --> 01:24:02,299
And so I think that everything that

1814
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:02,299
you're seeing here may become a new model

1815
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:02,299
that can be optioned into in terms of how

1816
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:02,299
you would.

1817
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:04,301
Want to structure your learning.

1818
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:07,304
So I think this is really important

1819
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:07,304
stuff.

1820
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:13,310
Daniel: How you'd like to structure your

1821
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:13,310
learning and how you'd like to learn

1822
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:13,310
structure exactly.

1823
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:16,313
7.3.

1824
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:26,323
The mathematics of Life we move on to

1825
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:26,323
consider the relationships between

1826
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:26,323
compositional active inference and the

1827
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:26,323
contemporary mathematics of life.

1828
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:35,332
We hope that compositional active

1829
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:35,332
inference may supply part of the story of

1830
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:35,332
a modern theory of autopoiesis the

1831
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:35,332
ability for life to recreate itself.

1832
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:41,338
So just some brief notes on topics that

1833
01:24:41,338 --> 01:24:41,338
are near and dear to us as we get close

1834
01:24:41,338 --> 01:24:41,338
to the end.

1835
01:24:41,338 --> 01:24:42,339
7.3.1.

1836
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:45,342
Bayesian mechanics and the free energy

1837
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
principle.

1838
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:57,354

1859
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:52,403
The present formulation of Bayesian

1860
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
mechanics is constructed using

1861
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
mathematical tools from physics, but not

1862
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
yet the kinds of compositional tools

1863
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
promoted in this thesis.

1864
01:25:53,404 --> 01:26:09,414
We expect that developments along the

1865
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
lines sketched here will unify the

1866
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
ongoing developments of Bayesian

1867
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
mechanics with the new synthetic

1868
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
understanding of mathematical physics by

1869
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
casting all dynamics as abstract

1870
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:09,414
inference.

1871
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:21,426
We should also expect this line of

1872
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
inquiry to begin to quantify the

1873
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
persistence of things and imbue much of

1874
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
physics within elon vital with a vital

1875
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
energy.

1876
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,429
Any thoughts on this?

1877
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:38,443
Dean: Okay, well, I was just going to say

1878
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:38,443
I think that section you've already

1879
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:38,443
talked about the importance of

1880
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:38,443
adjunction, and this section literally

1881
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:38,443
makes that very clear.

1882
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:55,460
I think that the relation and the

1883
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
translation are kind of the on and

1884
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
through of this part of where the

1885
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
Bayesian mechanics and the free energy

1886
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
principle help us understand that there

1887
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
is a statistical game that's also

1888
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
strategic.

1889
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,463
Again, I'll be interested to talk to.

1890
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:10,469
Daniel: Toby about that great carrying on

1891
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
with mathematics life seven, three, two

1892
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
biosemiotics Ali, want to give any

1893
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
summary or thoughts on biosimiotics?

1894
01:27:13,472 --> 01:27:13,472
Ali: Sure.

1895
01:27:13,472 --> 01:27:45,503
So the emerging biosymiotic

1896
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
reconceptualization of life explicitly

1897
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
acknowledges the importance and

1898
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
universality of communication in context,

1899
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
proposing that in any such situation, the

1900
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
interpreting system necessarily has an

1901
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
internal representation of the external

1902
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
world, so to speak, its own belt, which

1903
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
is updated by interpreting incoming

1904
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:45,503
signals.

1905
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:52,511
We can in principle reconstruct the

1906
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:52,511
external world by understanding it as

1907
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:52,511
that which a collection of systems agrees

1908
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:52,511
about.

1909
01:27:53,512 --> 01:28:02,515
Perhaps then, the shared universe, as

1910
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:02,515
determined topus theoretically of a

1911
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:02,515
fusion of active inference agents is a

1912
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:02,515
good model of this semi sphere.

1913
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:24,537
It seems therefore, that mathematics

1914
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
resulting from our work on internal

1915
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
universes and their interactions and more

1916
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
broadly, many of the formal ingredients

1917
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
of compositional active inference is well

1918
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
aligned with the informal structures of

1919
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
biosymiotics, and so it may be desirable

1920
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
to reexpress biosymiotics accordingly.

1921
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:41,554
In doing so, perhaps the mathematics of a

1922
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
modern Bayesian subjectivist metaphysics

1923
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
will be found, for instance, by

1924
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
expressing communication and its

1925
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
phenomenology as a geometric morphism, a

1926
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
generalized base change between agents

1927
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:41,554
internal universes.

1928
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:53,566
And it might be worth mentioning here the

1929
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
work of people like Terrence Deacon and

1930
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
also Karen Broad's agential Realism.

1931
01:28:53,566 --> 01:29:05,572
Because in Terrence Deacon's work, and

1932
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
particularly in his book called

1933
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
Incomplete Nature, he provides a kind of

1934
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
nested hierarchy.

1935
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:36,603
Of how various kinds of informations as

1936
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
provided to biological organisms are

1937
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
structured in a nested, hierarchical way

1938
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
that would allow the agent to distinguish

1939
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
the purely informational data as opposed

1940
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
to the semantic data that is, in the

1941
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
innermost level of the nested hierarchy.

1942
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:56,623
And also, Karen broad's agential realism

1943
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:56,623
provides this notion of intra action,

1944
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:56,623
which allow the agent or the system of

1945
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:56,623
interest to co constitute itself via the

1946
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:56,623
very interaction with the environment.

1947
01:29:56,623 --> 01:30:11,632
So it's not just pure interaction between

1948
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:11,632
the system and its environment, but

1949
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:11,632
rather both the agent and the environment

1950
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:11,632
co constitutes themselves through the

1951
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:11,632
intra action.

1952
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:19,640
So it might be worth exploring some of

1953
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:19,640
these ideas with Toby as well.

1954
01:30:21,642 --> 01:30:23,644
Daniel: Dean, anything to add on this

1955
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:23,644
one?

1956
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:26,647
Dean: No, I think Ali summed it up

1957
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:26,647
perfectly.

1958
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:27,648
Daniel: All right.

1959
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:36,657
And the final section Fundamental Theory

1960
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
future work connected to this thesis need

1961
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
not only be an application.

1962
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:41,662
A number of purely theoretical questions

1963
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:41,662
raise themselves too.

1964
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:51,672
So for people who we could already hear

1965
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
in the live chat in the YouTube comments

1966
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
complaining that this was too practical,

1967
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
too application oriented, don't worry.

1968
01:30:51,672 --> 01:31:07,682
There's also some theoretical questions

1969
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
that raise themselves so first, geometric

1970
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
methods for structured belief updating

1971
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
the mathematics of belief is in large

1972
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
part about replacing definite points with

1973
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
Fuzzier distributions over them.

1974
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:18,693
In fact, this PDF copy error with a fuzzy

1975
01:31:18,693 --> 01:31:18,693
interpretive system allows the word to be

1976
01:31:18,693 --> 01:31:18,693
read by a human independent type theory.

1977
01:31:18,693 --> 01:31:20,695
We replace points with terms.

1978
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:23,698
Non dependent terms are exactly points.

1979
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:28,703
So a type theory with belief should

1980
01:31:28,703 --> 01:31:28,703
somehow encompass fuzzy terms.

1981
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:35,710
We might well want to express beliefs

1982
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:35,710
about things whose identity we are not

1983
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:35,710
quite sure.

1984
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,712
Seven four two dynamics.

1985
01:31:38,712 --> 01:31:45,720
Chapter five supplies the beginnings of a

1986
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:45,720
compositional coalgebraic theory for

1987
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:45,720
open, stochastic and random dynamical

1988
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:45,720
systems in general time.

1989
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:52,727
And we hope that this theory could

1990
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:52,727
provide a home for a modern account of

1991
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:52,727
nonequilibrium systems.

1992
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:54,729
Home, home on the state space.

1993
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:58,733
And seven four three computation.

1994
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:05,734
A new understanding of computation may

1995
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:05,734
follow the semiotic understanding of

1996
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:05,734
information processing that we propose

1997
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:05,734
above.

1998
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:10,739
Perhaps we could say more precisely that

1999
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:10,739
computation is the dynamics of semiosis.

2000
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:32,761
The time is right for such a

2001
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
reconceptualization, as human made

2002
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
systems increasingly move away from von

2003
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
Neumann architectures towards more

2004
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
biosimilar ones such as Mem risters

2005
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
optical processors, Neuromorphic

2006
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
technology, graph processors, or even

2007
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
many core and mesh based evolutions of

2008
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
classical processors.

2009
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:38,767
So some absolutely fantastic theoretical

2010
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:38,767
avenues to pursue.

2011
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:41,770
Any of you want to comment on some of

2012
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:41,770
these avenues?

2013
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:42,771
Dean, please.

2014
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:50,779
Dean: In the dynamics section, there's a

2015
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
really interesting, again, more

2016
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
confirmation bias in my world.

2017
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:59,788
He says here, chapter five has supplied

2018
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
the beginnings of the composition of

2019
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
Coalgebraic theory for open, stochastic

2020
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
and random dynamical systems in general

2021
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
time.

2022
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:01,784
Me being a time guy.

2023
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:02,785
That's cool.

2024
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:13,796
And we hope that this theory could

2025
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:13,796
provide a home for a modern account of

2026
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:13,796
non equilibrium systems with category

2027
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:13,796
polynomial functions, applying a

2028
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:13,796
satisfactory account of these systems.

2029
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:15,798
And then I'm going to slow down because

2030
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:15,798
this is the part that I really like.

2031
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:36,819
Interfaces in brackets, I e, the

2032
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
boundaries across which information flows

2033
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
along and in the word along, there's the

2034
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
word on in the middle, which they compose

2035
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
and through which they interact, and me

2036
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
being an on and through being the same

2037
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:36,819
thing.

2038
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:41,824
This was fantastic confirmation of that

2039
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:41,824
in a dynamic sense.

2040
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:44,827
Daniel: And Ali.

2041
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:49,832
Ali: Yes.

2042
01:33:49,832 --> 01:34:24,861
And also, again, I think some of the work

2043
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
done by Bob Coke and his colleagues

2044
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
regarding the Bayesian quantum inference

2045
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
and especially proposing a kind of string

2046
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
diagrams in the sense of using category

2047
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
theory to explore the whole theory of the

2048
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
quantum Bayesian inference.

2049
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:36,873
I believe it maps unto this sense of

2050
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:36,873
dynamics as provided by Toby in the final

2051
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:36,873
pages of his dissertation.

2052
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:43,880
In the case that in the basing quantum

2053
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:43,880
inference, it is also a question.

2054
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,886
Of how to provide the exact time

2055
01:34:49,886 --> 01:34:49,886
evolution of each state or each agent.

2056
01:34:50,887 --> 01:35:01,892
Not strictly in a linear sense, but both

2057
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:01,892
in linear and sorry in the predictive and

2058
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:01,892
also the retroactive sense.

2059
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:13,904
In other words, by taking into account

2060
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:13,904
the whole arrow of time, not just a

2061
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:13,904
particular instant or particular moment

2062
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:13,904
of it.

2063
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:45,936
So in the sense, I think the discussion

2064
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
of non equilibrium systems, which is

2065
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
still an underexplored area of physics,

2066
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
by using category theory, can help to

2067
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
unify or at least make connections

2068
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
between these kinds of predictive models

2069
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
as used in classical physics and also

2070
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
some of the retroactive models as

2071
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
recently proposed in quantum Bayesian

2072
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
theory.

2073
01:35:47,938 --> 01:35:47,938
Daniel: Great.

2074
01:35:48,939 --> 01:36:00,945
And so we couldn't escape without showing

2075
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:00,945
at least a little bit of a hint of what

2076
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:00,945
realistically much of the dissertation

2077
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:00,945
looks like.

2078
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:04,949
So next time we're going to jump into the

2079
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:04,949
thick of it.

2080
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:11,956
These kinds of equations and diagrams are

2081
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
what you're going to find when you unpack

2082
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
the dissertation.

2083
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:24,969
And of course, there's so much to add and

2084
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:24,969
we did so much work on just scratching

2085
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:24,969
the surface of what these diagrams are

2086
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:24,969
and how they actually convey formality in

2087
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:24,969
category theory.

2088
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:31,976
And it's going to be great to work and

2089
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:31,976
talk together on them.

2090
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:39,984
And with Toby, where does that leave us,

2091
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:39,984
fellows?

2092
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:44,989
Dean with the pre penultimate thought and

2093
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:44,989
then Ollie?

2094
01:36:48,993 --> 01:36:54,999
Dean: Well, I think that there's going to

2095
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:54,999
be a big shift from today's Livestream.

2096
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:54,999
Ali: Which.

2097
01:36:58,003 --> 01:37:05,004
Dean: Tries to be gentle on us, but also

2098
01:37:05,004 --> 01:37:05,004
anybody who's really curious as to where

2099
01:37:05,004 --> 01:37:05,004
this goes next.

2100
01:37:05,004 --> 01:37:23,022
I think it's going to be a lot more

2101
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:23,022
sophisticated and there's going to be a

2102
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:23,022
little bit more work to do, but I think

2103
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:23,022
at least we've started down a path that

2104
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:23,022
hopefully we've piqued your curiosity.

2105
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:26,025
As the last question says, what are you

2106
01:37:26,025 --> 01:37:26,025
still curious about?

2107
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:38,037
I think there's a lot coming up that

2108
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:38,037
should be pretty good for those that want

2109
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:38,037
to really dig now into the real

2110
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:38,037
formalisms and the real structure of

2111
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:38,037
this.

2112
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:40,039
Daniel: Thank you, Dean.

2113
01:37:40,039 --> 01:37:40,039
Ali?

2114
01:37:45,044 --> 01:38:12,065
Ali: Well, at the end of our six month

2115
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
joyful ride through this dissertation, I

2116
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
believe, at least from a personal point

2117
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
of view, I truly learned a lot and it

2118
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
piqued my interest in lots of domains and

2119
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
areas which I didn't know I have interest

2120
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:12,065
in them before.

2121
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:55,108
So I think it's really a good mark of an

2122
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
influential work, be it dissertation or a

2123
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
book or paper or any other kinds of

2124
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
academic publication to peak people's

2125
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
mind, to explore in even some unexplored

2126
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
areas and try to connect the dots in

2127
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
particular in the category theory sense,

2128
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
in a very rigorous, well typed and even

2129
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:55,108
insightful ways.

2130
01:38:55,108 --> 01:39:05,112
And maybe some exciting developments and

2131
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:05,112
results can emerge from these kinds of

2132
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:05,112
dot connections.

2133
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:12,119
Daniel: Thank you both for this excellent

2134
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:12,119
stream.

2135
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:36,143
I have so much gratitude for the whole

2136
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
category theory team, not just the

2137
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
sheaves around Toby that enable and

2138
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
scaffold this work, but also the way that

2139
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
we were able to collaborate over the last

2140
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
months and in the bigger picture, maybe

2141
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
the end of a chapter.

2142
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:43,150
We just finished chapter one or chapter

2143
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:43,150
zero, and that's really what the dot zero

2144
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:43,150
is.

2145
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:45,152
So we were in the dot.

2146
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:50,157
Now we are bringing the dot zero to a

2147
01:39:50,157 --> 01:39:50,157
closure.

2148
01:39:50,157 --> 01:40:00,161
Soon we're going to jump into the dot one

2149
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:00,161
and the dot two with Toby and even that

2150
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:00,161
in some other nested scale is AOO or a

2151
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:00,161
dot zero.

2152
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:04,165
So thank you again, Ali and Dean et al.

2153
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,166
Till next time.

2154
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,170
Dean: Thank you.
