1
00:00:01,809 --> 00:00:03,147
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,056
It's June 7, 2023.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,614
We're in ActInf Livestream 54.1,

4
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:08,614
discussing “Mathematical Foundations for

5
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:08,614
a Compositional Account of the Bayesian

6
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:15,635
Brain.”

7
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,887
So, welcome to the Active Inference

8
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:18,961
Institute.

9
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,195
We're a participatory online institute

10
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:20,195
that is communicating, learning and

11
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:25,620
practicing applied active inference.

12
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:27,836
This is a recorded and an archived

13
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:27,836
Livestream, so please provide feedback so

14
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:31,228
we can improve our work.

15
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,521
All backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:34,521
welcome and we'll be following video

17
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:37,895
etiquette for live streams.

18
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:41,238
To learn more about live streams and

19
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:41,238
other projects, head over to

20
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,568
activimference.org.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,205
And we're here today in active stream 54.

22
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:51,232
.1.

23
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,524
We are in our first discussion with the

24
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:54,524
author of the work, “Mathematical

25
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:54,524
Foundations for a Compositional Account

26
00:00:54,524 --> 00:01:01,614
of the Bayesian Brain.”

27
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:03,815
Today in 54.1

28
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:07,225
we're going to say hello, then be on with

29
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:11,612
it and see where it all goes together.

30
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:13,855
So we'll begin with introductions.

31
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,148
I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

32
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,233
California.

33
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,570
Six months ago, I was quite unfamiliar

34
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:20,570
with category theory and have had quite a

35
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:20,570
fun journey with Ali and Dean and I guess

36
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:28,384
Toby via stigmergic proxy.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,569
So, really looking forward to this

38
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:31,628
discussion.

39
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:32,795
And I'll pass to Dean

40
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,945
and then Ali.

41
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,145
Dean: Thanks, Dan.

42
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:36,185
I'm Dean.

43
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,313
I'm here in Calgary.

44
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,860
My goal in joining this group was to take

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:43,860
the idea, as we caught in one of the

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:43,860
previous slides, the idea of practicing

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,062
applied active inference.

48
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,096
I see the potential through category

49
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:54,096
theory of making that even more

50
00:01:54,096 --> 00:02:00,090
accessible, more possible.

51
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,113
And so I'm really excited to have the

52
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:02,113
author with us today and maybe have a

53
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:02,113
look at what that means and I'll pass it

54
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:08,170
over to Ali.

55
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:14,235
Ali: Hello, I'm Ali, I'm an independent

56
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:14,235
researcher, premiere one, and as I said,

57
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:19,288
in zero.

58
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:25,339
I'm quite excited to be here to discuss

59
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,339
this magnificent dissertation with its

60
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:34,435
author in the past several months.

61
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:39,481
We did our best to understand and dissect

62
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:39,481
it as best as we could, but obviously we

63
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:39,481
have many, many questions that I'm

64
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:51,603
looking forward to discuss them with.

65
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:56,652
Daniel: So, Toby, thanks again for

66
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,661
joining.

67
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,687
Please lead us off with just any

68
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
introduction and background that's going

69
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
to set the stage, maybe how the work came

70
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:08,714
to be and that would be great.

71
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:09,725
So thanks again for joining.

72
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,732
Toby: Yes, great.

73
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,760
Well, thanks Dan and all of you guys for

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:13,760
hosting me and for having the courage to

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:13,760
read my thesis, which, as you noticed, it'

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,841
's a kind of strange mix of things.

77
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:23,869
It's kind of both the research work and,

78
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,869
as I noticed one of you saying in the

79
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,869
previous stream, it's at this kind of

80
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,869
frontier of knowledge and of course it

81
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:32,953
needs to be.

82
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,983
But I also, because this language is so

83
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:35,983
kind of unfamiliar to people and because

84
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:35,983
I think it will prove to be very useful

85
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:35,983
across the sciences, I really wanted to

86
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:47,100
make it kind of legible to people.

87
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,137
So for people to read the thesis, but

88
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
also, like my research and kind of

89
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
understand what I was saying effectively

90
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
how it came about was I was supposed to

91
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
be studying interactions between frontal

92
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,137
cortex and hippocampal circuits in the

93
00:03:50,137 --> 00:04:09,267
brain.

94
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,294
And at the sort of time of trying to get

95
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:12,294
started with that, obviously I was kind

96
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:12,294
of interested in the free energy

97
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:12,294
principle and active inference and all of

98
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:20,373
that.

99
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,406
But I found that there was a lot of as I

100
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
said in the thesis and as you talked

101
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
about in the previous stream and probably

102
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
in discussions before that as well, there'

103
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:34,513
's a lot of kind of each research

104
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:35,526
group has its own language.

105
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,557
And these different groups, they don't

106
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:38,557
necessarily talk to each other in a way

107
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:38,557
that is kind of an efficient kind of

108
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:46,630
communication.

109
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,652
Each group of people is interested in

110
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:49,662
their own thing.

111
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,681
And one of the things I like about the

112
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:51,681
free energy principle and about active

113
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:51,681
inference is that it's this nice sort of

114
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:57,742
general framework for adaptive systems.

115
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:00,710
And so it is in itself a good place to

116
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,710
kind of situate an understanding of

117
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,710
systems like the brain and other adaptive

118
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,771
systems.

119
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,801
But of course it doesn't immediately

120
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
resolve this problem of the problem that

121
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
was for me a kind of confusion about what'

122
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
's going on in these circuits and how

123
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
should I understand what one person says

124
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
in relationship to what another person

125
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:09,801
says about this bit of the brain or this

126
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:24,957
interaction.

127
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,987
And so in the process of kind of trying

128
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
to understand what was going on there and

129
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
to resolve, in part, the confusion I had

130
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
about predictive coding itself and the

131
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
complexities of all of these models I was

132
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
encountering, I kind of resolved to

133
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
replace that confusion with another kind

134
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:27,987
of confusion, which is, what is all this

135
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:48,195
crazy category theory stuff?

136
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,218
And so you might think, okay, well, that'

137
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,221
's mad.

138
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,229
What's the point of that?

139
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,245
You've just made everybody's life a lot

140
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:53,248
harder.

141
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:55,262
It's kind of like that xkcd comic

142
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:55,262
[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.

143
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:55,262
.png] where you've got all of these

144
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:55,262
different standards; and will you decide

145
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:55,262
to come together and make a new

146
00:05:55,262 --> 00:06:02,271
standard?

147
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,294
And in fact this is happening, I think,

148
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:04,294
in like, I don't know what it was in

149
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:07,329
cellular biology, maybe.

150
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:10,356
I heard John Baez talking about this

151
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
yesterday, that they have lots of

152
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
different standards for writing down

153
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
diagrams, for describing interacting like

154
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
biological processes and the kind of

155
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
scientific community in that area has set

156
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
up a kind of mediating body to kind of

157
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
try to bring together all of these

158
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:10,356
diagram languages but they weren't really

159
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:34,594
able to do so.

160
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,610
So they still they instead of just coming

161
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:36,610
up with one new standard, they came up

162
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:36,610
with three new standards to try to unify

163
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,647
these things.

164
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,676
And the trouble I had or have with these

165
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:42,676
different languages or different sort of

166
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:42,676
syntaxes for talking about scientific

167
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:42,676
things is that not only are they all

168
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:42,676
different, but they're kind of all ad hoc.

169
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:53,787
.

170
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,814
And so the reason why I feel that there's

171
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:56,814
promise in replacing this confusion of so

172
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:56,814
many different ideas I mean, of course it'

173
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:56,814
's great to have this kind of ecosystem

174
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:56,814
of ideas about how these complicated

175
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:56,814
systems work, but it's still very ad hoc

176
00:06:56,814 --> 00:07:10,896
and confusing.

177
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,926
And so instead of just coming up with a

178
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
new ad hoc and confusing way of

179
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
understanding these things, I was kind of

180
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
hoping to use a language which is maybe

181
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
kind of universal in some sense or it's

182
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
really capturing how we think and maybe

183
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:31,107
also how the world is actually built up.

184
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,127
But in particular it seems to capture

185
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,138
something of how we think.

186
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:37,163
And so the fundamental theorem of

187
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
category theory says that you shall know

188
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
a concept by the company it keeps to

189
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
adapt that sort of motto of, I think,

190
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
birth from linguistics, that you should

191
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
know a word by the company it keeps that'

192
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,163
's really like at the heart of how we

193
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:57,368
come to understand things in the world.

194
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,387
And I think the math that is category

195
00:07:59,387 --> 00:07:59,387
theory captures that very nicely and very

196
00:07:59,387 --> 00:07:59,387
precisely and at the same time enforces

197
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:05,382
the kind of discipline.

198
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:08,416
And so I know it is quite like hard going

199
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:08,416
reading this kind of research work, this

200
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:08,416
kind of introduction to all this new

201
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:08,416
stuff, but in part that's because being

202
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:08,416
disciplined is hard and doing things very

203
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:08,416
formally, precisely does require a bit of,

204
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:27,606
, well, a lot of dedication.

205
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:31,640
But that isn't to say that it's not worth

206
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:31,640
it or that these ideas even used a bit

207
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:31,640
informally somewhere down the line might

208
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:31,640
not be useful at least to sort of frame

209
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:39,728
the way we think about things.

210
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:43,764
So I hope to be some use in helping not

211
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:43,764
only sort of change the confusions that

212
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:43,764
we have, but also modulate them in a kind

213
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:43,764
of way that will be sort of useful for

214
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:53,869
people.

215
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:58,916
Daniel: Awesome.

216
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,883
Great starting place.

217
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:06,937
Ali or Dean, where can we begin?

218
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,966
How can we replace some of our prior

219
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:09,966
confusions with a new and different

220
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,001
confusion?

221
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,058
Ali, want to go first or can.

222
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,069
Dean: I ask a quick question to Toby?

223
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,103
Toby, when you were talking about when

224
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:23,103
you actually saw all of these standards,

225
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:23,103
so now you were the sort of what, you

226
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:33,208
were the hub of all of these standards.

227
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,231
You saw sort of all around you.

228
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,271
Can you maybe speak to the idea of what

229
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,271
you perceived or what you sensed was the

230
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,271
stabilizing function of those standards

231
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,271
but also the searching function because

232
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,271
of course you had gone out and realized

233
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,271
there were all of these different

234
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:57,440
standards at play.

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,412
I remember it in a previous professional

236
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:00,412
life of mine having to have chief

237
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:00,412
financial officers and their math sit at

238
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:00,412
the table with engineers and their math

239
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:00,412
and them talking right past one another

240
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:14,559
and making no sense to each other.

241
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,583
And I had to be kind of the medium

242
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:17,583
between them so that their math would

243
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:17,583
actually get a little bit sticky and they'

244
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:17,583
'd be actually able to understand and

245
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:26,679
interpret one another.

246
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,711
In your experience with this, how did

247
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:31,722
that play out?

248
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,743
Both the stabilization through the

249
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:34,757
standards and the search.

250
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:39,802
Toby: Well, I guess I should begin by

251
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:39,802
saying that this is still, like, ongoing.

252
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,841
.

253
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,865
And nor am I an expert in all of these

254
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:46,878
different standards.

255
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:50,914
But the thing that I kind of at least

256
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:50,914
noticed, right, that was that people use

257
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:50,914
languages like Bayesian inference or

258
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:50,914
reinforcement learning or dynamical

259
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:50,914
systems to talk about certain bits of the

260
00:10:50,914 --> 00:11:07,019
brain that I was interested in.

261
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,056
And they kind of just plug all these

262
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:12,076
ideas together and it's fine.

263
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,094
So you want to write a paper and it's

264
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:14,094
about a particular phenomenon, and it's

265
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,116
great.

266
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:19,144
You maybe come up with some nice model

267
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:19,144
and you put people in MRI scanners and

268
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:19,144
the quantities in the sort of bold signal

269
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:28,232
correspond to quantities in your model.

270
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,241
And that's great.

271
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,260
It says that maybe this bit of the brain

272
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,267
is doing that.

273
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,290
I mean, we can argue about MRI at some

274
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,290
other time, but it doesn't really tell

275
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,290
you about how that little model you've

276
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,290
got interacts with the rest of the brain

277
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:41,368
or the rest of the world.

278
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,385
And so if you care about this whole

279
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:43,385
complicated thing, you want to know, how

280
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:43,385
do these parts actually talk to each

281
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:47,426
other?

282
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,457
And so I was just fortunate at the kind

283
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:50,457
of beginning of this, in some sense, to

284
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:55,505
be in the right place at the right time.

285
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,528
So I kind of knew there were these

286
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:57,528
different ingredients all being put into

287
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:57,528
these different models, and I'm only sort

288
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:57,528
of familiar with some of them, but I

289
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:57,528
could still see that they had sort of

290
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:10,590
similar structure.

291
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,618
And that was in part because I've been

292
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
going to some applied category theory

293
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
meetings or talks and seen that, say,

294
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
economic games, which are very closely

295
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
related to reinforcement learning, have

296
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
this kind of bi directional structure

297
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,618
where an agent tries to sort of

298
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:31,806
effectively, in some sense, choose.

299
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:34,832
They make an observation, and they sort

300
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:34,832
of do this kind of forward projecting

301
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:34,832
kind of thing of choosing an action at

302
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:34,832
the same time as saying, okay, well, if

303
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:34,832
supposing I take this action, what would

304
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:44,938
the payoff be?

305
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,962
And that's this kind of backwards facing

306
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:47,966
thing.

307
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,988
And then you can sort of chain that

308
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
process and think, well, if I do this in

309
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
multiple stages, like, how does the

310
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
utility I get at the end of this multi

311
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
stage process feed back to the utility I'

312
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:49,988
'm going to get, having taken just one

313
00:12:49,988 --> 00:13:02,053
step right now?

314
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:05,081
And that's a similar sort of bi

315
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:05,081
directional thing to what happens in

316
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:05,081
Active, or like in well, in predictive

317
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:05,081
coding, specifically, where a little

318
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:05,081
circuit is saying, okay, well, given my

319
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:05,081
high level beliefs about what's causing

320
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:21,246
this sensory data.

321
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:24,272
I need to sort of retrofit the actual

322
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:24,272
sensory data to kind of come up with a

323
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:29,324
new belief about what those causes are.

324
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:31,349
And so that seemed to me to have the same

325
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,359
kind of structure.

326
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,391
A similar thing also happens in backdrop,

327
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
in machine learning where you have say

328
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
some neural network and you feed forward

329
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
some information through the network and

330
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
it say does a classification and then you

331
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
have some training system which says,

332
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
okay, well, actually, you had this error,

333
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
and then you need to sort of back

334
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:36,391
propagate that to update, say, some part

335
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:58,615
of the model on the basis of that.

336
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,572
So that also has this kind of bi

337
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,583
directional structure.

338
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,612
And it just was fortunate that at this

339
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:04,612
time people were talking a lot about

340
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:08,658
these kind of bi directional processes.

341
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:11,681
And so I was thinking about these things

342
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:11,681
at the same time I was kind of thinking

343
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:11,681
about the application of Bayesian

344
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:11,681
inference, and I kind of noticed that

345
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:19,761
they had the same structure.

346
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:22,794
And I kind of wanted to figure out what

347
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:22,794
was going on there, really sort of pin

348
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:22,794
down what it was that made this kind of

349
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:22,794
predictive coding circuit have this kind

350
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:34,913
of shape in some sense.

351
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,944
Because as I think you've also talked

352
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:37,944
about and as I kind of mentioned a few

353
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:37,944
minutes ago, that individual predictive

354
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:37,944
coding circuit isn't an isolated system,

355
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:46,037
right?

356
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:49,061
It's part of like this hierarchical thing.

357
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,061
.

358
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,085
And so you have one little circuit

359
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:51,085
connected to another circuit and that

360
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:51,085
whole conglomeration of circuitry is

361
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:51,085
supposed to do something quite grand, but

362
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:51,085
at the same time it's made of smaller

363
00:14:51,085 --> 00:15:02,133
parts.

364
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,167
And one of the major confusions I had at

365
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
the beginning was, okay, so you have this

366
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
big generative model with lots and lots

367
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
of factors, and you go through it and you

368
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
try to derive the differential equations

369
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
that give you the sort of predictive

370
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
coding dynamics by saying, okay, well, we'

371
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
're going to minimize the free energy and

372
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
you have this complicated thing with lots

373
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
of sums in it and it seems like very

374
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
intimidating to try to come up with that

375
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
differential equation, even though,

376
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
actually, when you sort of look at this,

377
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
the look at the process that you're doing

378
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
is quite kind of mechanical because

379
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
effectively, you're doing the same

380
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,167
transformation to each factor of this

381
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:45,568
model.

382
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,598
And so that also hinted that there was

383
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:48,598
this kind of compositionality thing going

384
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:53,640
on in these systems.

385
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,663
Not only do you see that this bit of the

386
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:55,663
brain has this kind of modularity, but

387
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:55,663
you also get a sense of that modularity

388
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:01,667
in that derivation you're doing.

389
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:04,694
And so what I wanted to do was to capture

390
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:05,704
both of these things.

391
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:08,731
One is the kind of shape of the circuitry

392
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:08,731
and the other is like how to somehow save

393
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:08,731
the effort of having to kind of rederrive

394
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:15,808
everything for each different case.

395
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:19,841
And that kind of formalization of this

396
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:19,841
process corresponds to a kind of

397
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:19,841
functoriality you get when effectively

398
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:19,841
this functoriality means you preserve

399
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:29,939
compositional structure.

400
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,962
And so what you want to do is you want to

401
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:31,962
say, okay, well, what's the compositional

402
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:31,962
structure of the thing that the function

403
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:31,962
starts with, like the process starts with,

404
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:31,962
, and that's the compositional structure

405
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:41,067
of Bayesian inference itself.

406
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:43,087
And then you want to say, okay, well,

407
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:43,087
what's the compositional structure of the

408
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:43,087
kind of dynamical systems, which is the

409
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:43,087
thing you're trying to get to, and how do

410
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:43,087
you map from one to the other in a way

411
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:52,171
that preserves that structure?

412
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,195
And so that's kind of what I was doing in

413
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:54,195
this thesis, is just saying, okay, what

414
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:54,195
are the structures I need and how do I

415
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:59,246
relate them?

416
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,220
And it turned out that there were a lot

417
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,220
of details, I had to write them all down.

418
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,242
.

419
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:08,273
But the kind of basic idea, I hope is

420
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,283
quite simple.

421
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:12,312
It's just trying to say what are those

422
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:12,312
kind of the kind of individual components

423
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:12,312
like the kind of Lego blocks and how do

424
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:12,312
they connect together and how can I sort

425
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:12,312
of relate the kind of Lego blocks of one

426
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:12,312
thing with the Lego blocks of another in

427
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:30,491
a way that kind of preserves the shapes?

428
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:35,540
And so, yeah, it's kind of mammoth thing,

429
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:35,540
but the kind of fundamental idea is quite

430
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,580
simple.

431
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:41,604
And I think it's kind of like how when if

432
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:41,604
you're like programming a computer, you

433
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:41,604
can write in a high level language or you

434
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:48,671
can write in like low level language.

435
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,699
And if you wanted to, you could write in

436
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,711
assembly language.

437
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,748
And category theory is like a language

438
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:55,748
where you start with the kind of assembly

439
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:55,748
language and you build up a high level

440
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:55,748
language within the language itself in

441
00:17:55,748 --> 00:18:05,785
some sense.

442
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,811
And so if you really want to start with

443
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
at the very beginning, like I did with

444
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
the definition of category, and then

445
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
build up to this big thing, you have to

446
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
make a lot of steps because like,

447
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
assembly language is really simple and it'

448
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:08,811
's just like single instructions that

449
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:22,952
your processor does.

450
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:24,971
And so getting all the way to something

451
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:24,971
like zoom that can do a video call is

452
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,997
quite complicated.

453
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:29,002
And so people don't they start with the

454
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
high level language, but the thing that

455
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
people strive for in designing high level

456
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
languages is to set them up in such a way

457
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
that the abstractions are quite nice or

458
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:41,014
sort of modular.

459
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:44,017
And so that's what I'm trying to do with

460
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:44,017
using category theory, is to kind of find

461
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:44,017
abstractions that are modular in a

462
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:50,022
similar kind of way.

463
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:53,026
And I know on the previous call, Dan, you

464
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
mentioned the kind of analogy between

465
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
Piping in this category theoretic sense

466
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
and in the programming sense, and they're

467
00:18:53,026 --> 00:19:04,031
quite similar.

468
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:08,035
The category theory sense is kind of a

469
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,038
much sort of more general, bigger idea.

470
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,040
It sort of encompasses all kinds of

471
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,041
things.

472
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,045
But you could imagine somewhere down the

473
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
line having a programming language and

474
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
that people are trying to build these

475
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
things, but having a programming language

476
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
where you could express anything, you

477
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
could in category theory and I, to be

478
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,045
honest, find it quite intense and quite

479
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:32,059
sometimes mechanical and tedious.

480
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,062
How to prove that certain categorical

481
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:35,062
structure satisfies the coherence

482
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:35,062
conditions that it has to satisfy, like

483
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:35,062
lacks associativity or monoidality or

484
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:43,070
something like this.

485
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,073
There are a lot of diagrams you have to

486
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
check commute or something, and much of

487
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:52,079
the time that checking is quite tedious.

488
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,081
And someday I hope that we all have tools

489
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
that we could say, okay, well, I'm going

490
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
to spell out what my structure is, and

491
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
the tool will just check that it

492
00:19:54,081 --> 00:20:03,084
satisfies all the axioms.

493
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,086
And so I know you guys had to wade

494
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
through a lot of that stuff in the thesis,

495
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
, but it's kind of manually necessary

496
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
right now, but in the future it might not

497
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:12,093
be.

498
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,095
And then we can use this high level

499
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:14,095
language in a much more kind of liberal

500
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,098
way, I hope.

501
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,099
That would be great.

502
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,100
Sorry, I've been waffling operators.

503
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,101
I'll stop there.

504
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:22,103
Daniel: Awesome.

505
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:23,104
Great.

506
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,106
I'll go to a question.

507
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:29,110
In the chat Mark wrote, applied category

508
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,110
theory and active inference have

509
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,114
tremendous promise.

510
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,116
I confess I have not yet read this

511
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:35,116
dissertation.

512
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,118
It would be helpful to describe a

513
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:38,118
specific engineering application for the

514
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:40,121
work.

515
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:44,125
So what do you see as proximate and and

516
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,129
or distal engineering applications here?

517
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:54,135
Toby: So one of the things that I hope

518
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
could be produced soon as an engineering

519
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
application is a sort of general modeling

520
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
framework for building kind of

521
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
complicated active inference systems that

522
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
might include lots of parts, lots of

523
00:20:54,135 --> 00:21:15,150
agents.

524
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,154
Kind of like something that my colleague

525
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
Jules Hedges once in cybernetics more

526
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
generally, something like kind of

527
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
programming language, maybe, that

528
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
incorporates all of these kind of strange

529
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
cybernetic structures I mentioned earlier,

530
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
, like reinforcement learning and

531
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
backprop in machine learning and Bayesian

532
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
inference, they all have this kind of bi

533
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:46,181
directionality.

534
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,183
And so you should be able to have this

535
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
kind of modeling environment which allows

536
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
you to incorporate all of these things in

537
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:54,189
a kind of nice way.

538
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,193
But I think before we get something quite

539
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
as grand as a whole new sort of modeling

540
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
environment, I think just having tools to

541
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
help us build approximate and active

542
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
inference systems that are really nicely

543
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
compositional is one thing that I hope to

544
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:13,202
come out of this.

545
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,205
To be honest, I don't know very well what

546
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
the general tooling is like for this kind

547
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:20,209
of thing right now.

548
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,211
I know that there's SPM, I know that

549
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:22,211
there's, like, pi MDP for certain kinds

550
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:22,211
of problem, but I don't know how general

551
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:29,218
they are.

552
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:33,222
Another thing that you would get if you

553
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:33,222
have this kind of toolkit, because of the

554
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:33,222
kind of modularity of category theories,

555
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:33,222
you should be able to plug it into other

556
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:43,232
things that exist already.

557
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,235
So one of the things that's particularly

558
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
of interest to me at the moment is kind

559
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
of multi agent systems and sort of

560
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
building trying to understand how we

561
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
could build something like or simulate

562
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
things like something like a corporation

563
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
or some kind of some kind of society

564
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
structure where you've got lots of active

565
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
inference agents coming together to

566
00:22:46,235 --> 00:23:11,254
pursue a sort of common shared goal.

567
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,258
How can you kind of effectively

568
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:15,258
distribute that goal sharing across

569
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:19,262
systems.

570
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,264
They could be like little robotic systems,

571
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
, say, or something like that, or agent

572
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:25,268
or like I don't know precisely.

573
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:27,270
I'm kind of like an abstract thinker.

574
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,274
But being able to kind of control or

575
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
modulate the performance of these kind of

576
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
distributed multi agent like active

577
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
inference systems might be quite a cool

578
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:46,289
thing to be able to build.

579
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,293
So that's kind of like maybe flavor of

580
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:50,293
the kind of thing that this tooling gives

581
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:55,298
you.

582
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,297
I suppose for me, this particular work

583
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:00,297
was really about trying to encourage

584
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:00,297
people to use this language to understand

585
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:08,305
things more clearly.

586
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:13,310
So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that I

587
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,310
hope we can understand, or at least I can

588
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,315
understand more clearly.

589
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:19,316
Sure.

590
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
Daniel: Awesome.

591
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,321
Thank you, Ali.

592
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:27,324
Ali: Thank you.

593
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:28,325
Yes.

594
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
So in this paper by Christophe Voitowich,

595
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:31,328
are there category theoretical

596
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:37,334
explanations of physical phenomena?

597
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,338
He argues that category theory by itself

598
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
does not and cannot provide any

599
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
mathematical explanations for physical

600
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:49,346
phenomena.

601
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:53,350
So the idea here is that category theory

602
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
is merely a meta theory to kind of do a

603
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
kind of bookkeeping or householding of

604
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
the physical theories, and it's not a

605
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
tool to construct the mathematical theory

606
00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:11,362
of physical phenomena itself.

607
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:15,366
I'm not sure I agree with this argument

608
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
entirely because in one sense, some of

609
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
the most profound, AHA, moments in the

610
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
history of science obviously results from

611
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
looking at preexisting theory or a model

612
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:32,383
from a novel angle.

613
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:35,386
And I believe category theory can provide

614
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:35,386
such novel perspectives even when looking

615
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:35,386
at some established and preexisting

616
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:44,395
models or theories.

617
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm curious to know your opinion about

618
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
this.

619
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,403
So do you think category theory can

620
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
actually provide mathematical

621
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
explanations for either in cognitive

622
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
science, neuroscience, or even other

623
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
areas, other scientific disciplines as

624
00:25:52,403 --> 00:26:06,411
well?

625
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,415
Toby: I think it's a subtle question.

626
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:13,418
Right now, it's probably largely the case

627
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
that the role of category theory is kind

628
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
of this I think it's like bookkeeping,

629
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
but like Clarification too bookkeeping,

630
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
if you think of it in a sort of very

631
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
general way of trying to account for the

632
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
things you're thinking about very

633
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:35,439
precisely and not sort of miss details.

634
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,442
Like if your books don't balance, you

635
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,444
kind of miss some payment or some debt.

636
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,446
I think that's quite a nice analogy.

637
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:46,451
But I think one of the goals of quite a

638
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
lot of people, or not maybe a fair chunk

639
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
of the community, particularly that which

640
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
comes from a sort of more abstract

641
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
mathematical side of category theory, one

642
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
of their goals is to try to recast a lot

643
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
of how we think in kind of purely

644
00:26:46,451 --> 00:27:10,469
categorical language.

645
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:14,473
So one of the things that category theory

646
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:14,473
allows us to do is to kind of formalize

647
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:14,473
in some sense patterns that crop up all

648
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:14,473
over the place using the notion of

649
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:26,485
universal construction.

650
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:29,488
And the thing about universal

651
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
constructions is that you have some

652
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:34,493
little pattern.

653
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:37,496
And if you know that you can instantiate

654
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
that pattern in your category, that you

655
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
have some object which kind of captures

656
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
the essence of that pattern and you don't

657
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
need to say be able to kind of write down

658
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
all of the specifics of that object sort

659
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
of a priori, because the kind of

660
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
universality gives you a recipe for

661
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:58,517
constructing it.

662
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:01,514
It gives you it in some sort of unique

663
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,515
way.

664
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,517
And so you know that if you have this

665
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:04,517
universality, you can always access this

666
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:08,521
object.

667
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,524
I'm talking very generally, but because

668
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
of that, one thing that people try to do

669
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
is to try to say okay, well, we've got

670
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
these things that we're interested in in,

671
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
say, physics like the principle of least

672
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
action or the nature of spacetime or

673
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:31,544
something like that.

674
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,548
Can we express those things as kind of

675
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
universal constructions or, for instance,

676
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
in a completely different realm, like we

677
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
might have some process which is

678
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
something we're interested in on the

679
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
computer, like the migration of data in

680
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:52,565
databases.

681
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,568
Can we write that down in a way that

682
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:55,568
doesn't have any kind of ad hoc

683
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,571
ingredients?

684
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,568
It only is built from universal

685
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,570
constructions.

686
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
These are things that we can just write

687
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
down kind of abstract sort of axioms in

688
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
the language of category theory and that

689
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
kind of gives us the process or the

690
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:16,583
structure that we want.

691
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:21,588
This kind of line of work is often called

692
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,588
like synthetic something like synthetic

693
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,588
probability theory or synthetic physics

694
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,588
or synthetic topology or something like

695
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:33,600
that.

696
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,603
And it means you sort of start from these

697
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
kinds of very high level categorical

698
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
ideas and then you sort of end up with a

699
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
characterization of the essence of the

700
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:45,612
thing you're interested in in physics.

701
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:49,616
A simple example of this which I supply

702
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
in a kind of relatively feeble effort to

703
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
say that it's not true that category

704
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
theory doesn't give you a

705
00:29:49,616 --> 00:30:01,622
characterization of things in physics.

706
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,625
So there is a category of, say,

707
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:04,625
topological spaces and the morphisms

708
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:11,632
between them are continuous functions.

709
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:16,637
And there's a category rather of sets.

710
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:19,640
And the morphism between the sets are

711
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
functions.

712
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
And of course, underlying every

713
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,645
continuous function is a plane function.

714
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,648
And so there is a function from the

715
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
category of topological spaces to the

716
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
category of sets which just forget the

717
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
topological structure of the spaces

718
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
because every topological space has an

719
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:39,660
underlying set of points.

720
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,663
So you have this forgetful functor and

721
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,665
this forgetful functor has two adjoins.

722
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,668
And one of the things the category theory

723
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
teaches you is that adjunctions give you

724
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:52,672
this universality.

725
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,676
So adjoin functions are characterized

726
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:55,676
uniquely by their kind of satisfaction of

727
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:01,676
this adjunction property.

728
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,680
So these two adjoints to this forgetful

729
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
functor one gives you what are called

730
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,685
discrete spaces.

731
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,687
So if you take a set, you can turn it

732
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:12,687
into a topological space by thinking of

733
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:12,687
all the points as little islands in this

734
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:12,687
space so there's no connectivity between

735
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:19,694
them.

736
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,697
And that's called a kind of discrete

737
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,698
space on that set.

738
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,702
And the other adjoin puncture gives you

739
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
what's called the indiscrete or sometimes

740
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
co discrete space where all of the points

741
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
are sort of collected into one big island,

742
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
, so they're all sort of connected

743
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:39,714
together.

744
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:41,716
So it's like a sort of fully connected

745
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:42,717
graph.

746
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,720
And of course that's very different from

747
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
the discrete space and it's different

748
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
from the spacetime or the space that you

749
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
live in which has a particular kind of

750
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
connectivity, like you can't walk through

751
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:55,730
walls.

752
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,734
And so people try to use these things,

753
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
particularly use adjunctions to

754
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
characterize things like properties of

755
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:04,733
spaces.

756
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,735
Another thing that comes out of a

757
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
jointness and this is something that I

758
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
can let you read about later because it'

759
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
'll take me the rest of the talk to try

760
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:15,744
to explain.

761
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:19,748
But you might be familiar from logic that

762
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
you have these quantifiers, you have

763
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
existential and universal quantifiers and

764
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
you can do things with these quantifiers

765
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
like you can sort of compose them

766
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:31,760
together.

767
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,762
So you get things like for all x, there

768
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
exists for Y, such that this and you can

769
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
think sometimes of these composites or

770
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
these compositions of quantifiers as like

771
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:44,773
maybe like modal operators.

772
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:48,777
Like you can sort of decompose necessity

773
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
and possibility in terms of the

774
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:54,783
compositions of logical quantifiers.

775
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:57,785
But the kind of weird thing about

776
00:32:57,785 --> 00:32:57,785
quantifiers is that they too arise out of

777
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,783
an adjunction.

778
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,787
It's kind of like they are left and right

779
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:06,789
adjoints to substitution.

780
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,791
So if you have a proposition, you can

781
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
substitute a term intimate and the

782
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
adjoint punctures to substitution give

783
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
you the quantifiers and you can sort of

784
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
take this another step and then you can

785
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
think about like composing these adjoin

786
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
punctures and those give you the modal

787
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:23,806
operators.

788
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:26,809
And so that's something that comes just

789
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
out of category theory, but is really

790
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:30,813
sort of fundamental in sort of logic.

791
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:33,816
And we might think that there's a kind of

792
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:33,816
close relationship between physics and

793
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:33,816
computation or physics and logic, or

794
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:33,816
physics and information and information

795
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:43,825
and computation and logic.

796
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:46,829
So I think it's not quite true that there'

797
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
's nothing to be gained from thinking

798
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
about kind of traditional mathematical

799
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:56,839
things or traditional physical things.

800
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,840
Using category theory.

801
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,837
In some sense doing that really clarifies

802
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
the essence of them because it tells you

803
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
what their kind of universal properties

804
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
are and you can then instantiate those

805
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:11,848
things in different contexts.

806
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:13,850
So one of the things that you could do is

807
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
start to think about these kind of

808
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
logical structures in different contexts.

809
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,855
.

810
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,856
And that's kind of like what type theory

811
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:20,857
is all about.

812
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:22,859
And you could use it to think about the

813
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
logic of dynamical systems, or you could

814
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
use it to try to characterize, say, the

815
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:22,859
universal property even of the free

816
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:31,868
energy principle.

817
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,870
And that's something that I like to think

818
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:33,870
about sometimes.

819
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,873
How can we think about active inference

820
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
systems as trying to achieve their

821
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,876
goals?

822
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:43,880
Is that related to these adjunctions that

823
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:43,880
come up in sort of foundations of logic

824
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,885
when you look at them categorically?

825
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:50,887
And if it is, then that's quite profound

826
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
because.

827
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,890
It tells you that maybe the FEP does have

828
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:53,890
this kind of universality that people

829
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,894
want to claim it does.

830
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:02,893
So I think it is true that right now,

831
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:02,893
because it's quite early days, category

832
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:02,893
theory is kind of mostly used for

833
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:10,901
bookkeeping.

834
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,904
But I guess that might be because there's

835
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
quite a lot of bookkeeping to do before

836
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
we can make the most of this kind of move,

837
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
, make the most of using these kind of

838
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
universal structures and maybe one day

839
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
further in the future where people are

840
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
more familiar with this kind of language

841
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
and we have this big library of

842
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
categorical tools and our computer sort

843
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
of modeling environments and programming

844
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
languages know how to import stuff from

845
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:41,932
this category just really easily.

846
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,935
And so you don't have to do all this kind

847
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:45,936
of PDS manual stuff.

848
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,939
Maybe like in that future it'll be much

849
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:48,939
more common just to say okay, well we're

850
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:48,939
going to start to model things using

851
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:48,939
these universal properties off the bat

852
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:48,939
rather than trying to sort of retrofit

853
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:59,950
them.

854
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:03,948
Daniel: Awesome.

855
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:04,949
Thank you Toby.

856
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:05,950
Ali?

857
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:08,953
Ali: Yes.

858
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:10,955
Thank you so much for your detailed

859
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:10,955
answer and again I have a follow up

860
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,959
question to that.

861
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,963
So there's this view in philosophy of

862
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:18,963
science that views scientific theories as

863
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:18,963
not as a kind of monolithic, I mean,

864
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:18,963
phenomena or model, but rather any given

865
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:18,963
scientific theory can be viewed as a

866
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:36,981
population of models.

867
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,983
So some of those models are more

868
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:40,985
fundamental than the others.

869
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:46,991
Or in terms of manual delanda, there are

870
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:46,991
virtual and actual parts of any given

871
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:51,996
scientific model.

872
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,000
So the idea here is that the actual parts

873
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
of scientific models try to capture the

874
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
context dependent behavior of phenomena

875
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:06,004
or any physical system.

876
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,008
But on the other hand, the virtual or

877
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
more fundamental part of scientific

878
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
models or theories try to somehow capture

879
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
its more abstract and abstract model of

880
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
the phenomena in terms of its topological

881
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:25,024
invariance.

882
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:29,028
So do you think category theory can

883
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
provide a rigorous language to somehow

884
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
unify this view of science and to see how

885
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
exactly those context dependent part of

886
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
scientific theories fit or at least can

887
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
be compatible with the context

888
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
independent part of scientific theories

889
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:56,055
or the virtual part?

890
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:01,054
Because you see, in the context dependent

891
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
or actual models scientists usually try

892
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
to refine their models to fit the data as

893
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
close as possible or at least

894
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:15,068
approximately close enough to be useful.

895
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:19,072
But for the more fundamental parts

896
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
comprising of principles, axioms and so

897
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
on, they only try to capture the

898
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
topological terrain or the topological

899
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
invariance of the models and how models

900
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
can be compared in terms of their

901
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:45,098
singularities and topological shapes.

902
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,102
Toby: Yeah, that does sound very familiar.

903
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:49,102
.

904
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:53,105
I don't know this kind of work or idea in

905
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:53,105
any I haven't come across this before,

906
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:53,105
but it does sound something that be quite

907
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:59,112
amenable.

908
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,109
And in fact, there seems to be, at least

909
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
in my mind, some alignment between this

910
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
kind of sense of virtual that you're

911
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
talking about and this kind of

912
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:10,117
universality that I was talking about.

913
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:14,121
So you could think of a category of

914
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
models of particular kind as being

915
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
inhabited by all of those things which

916
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:22,129
satisfy these invariants.

917
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:24,131
And then you have different individual

918
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,131
instances of these things which would be

919
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,131
like the object of the category, and then

920
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,131
the differences between them are the

921
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:33,140
morphisms.

922
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,143
And the thing about morphism in the

923
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
category is that often they are the

924
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:41,148
things which preserve the structure.

925
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,150
In other bits of mathematics, they're

926
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,150
called homomorphisms, and that's where

927
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,154
the word morphism comes from.

928
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,157
And so you could think of those as ways

929
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:50,157
of comparing the models or translating

930
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:50,157
the models from one to the other, but

931
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:59,166
preserving those invariants.

932
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,163
That seems to me to capture some of the

933
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,165
idea that you were sketching.

934
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,169
I guess one thing which may or may not be

935
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:08,169
useful, depending on how you look at it,

936
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:08,169
that category theory gives you is it's

937
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:16,177
obviously kind of a lot more general.

938
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:20,181
And so it allows you to talk about

939
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
invariants of kinds that are more than

940
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
just more than just topological in some

941
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
sense, like functoriality is it kind of

942
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
captures the kind of invariance as well

943
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
and saying, okay, well, we preserve this

944
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:40,201
structure.

945
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:47,208
Just one way of looking at a topological

946
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
space is to take its its what's called

947
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:52,213
its nerve.

948
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:56,217
And so that takes a topological space and

949
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:59,220
turns it into a category.

950
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:03,218
And you could sort of think of the

951
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:03,218
morphisms in that category as the paths

952
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:03,218
in that space, or ways to sort of get

953
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:03,218
from one sort of part of the space to

954
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:13,228
another.

955
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:17,232
And then morphisms functions between

956
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
topological spaces considered in

957
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
categories like that, they really are

958
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
just things that preserve those

959
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:27,242
topological structures.

960
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:33,248
This language kind of seems to encompass

961
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
the kinds of things you're saying, yeah,

962
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:38,253
it would be nice.

963
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:41,256
I would love somebody to make that

964
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:42,256
connection.

965
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:46,261
Daniel: Just follow up on this and then

966
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:47,262
dean it's.

967
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:50,265
A related comment from Roman in the Chat.

968
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
.

969
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:52,267
Roman wrote, quoted you in this fractal

970
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
quote, streaming thinking about the FEP

971
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
through category theory and relation to

972
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
goals maybe allows to prove that FEP has

973
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
the universality that people claim it has.

974
00:41:52,267 --> 00:42:04,273
.

975
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,277
And Roman asks, didn't Maxwell, Ramstead

976
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:08,277
and Dalton Sactiva Develle already kind

977
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:08,277
of prove this in the Bayesian mechanics

978
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:16,285
physics of and by belief work?

979
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,287
So you're talking about the role of

980
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,288
generalization.

981
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,293
What do we gain with the category

982
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
theorification of FEP beyond, for example,

983
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
, the generalizations that we've seen in

984
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
Bayesian mechanics and g theory over the

985
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:36,305
last year?

986
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
Toby: Yeah, that's a great question.

987
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:46,315
I think Maxwell and Dalton are doing a

988
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:46,315
great job formalizing the ideas of

989
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:46,315
Bayesian mechanics, but as far as I'm

990
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:57,326
aware, the job isn't done yet.

991
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:03,326
And so I haven't yet seen I have a

992
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:07,330
particular aesthetic right.

993
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,333
And I would like I would like to see a

994
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
really clear recipe of a way to take on

995
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
the one hand or, like, some machine that

996
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
takes in that has, like, a particular

997
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:23,346
shape that is, like, input shape.

998
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:27,350
And it takes in a dynamical system of a

999
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
particular kind and it gives me back like

1000
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
the the specification of an inference

1001
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
problem that that dynamical system is

1002
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:37,360
solving.

1003
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,363
I think that's what Bayesy mechanics is

1004
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:41,364
saying.

1005
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:44,367
It's saying, okay, well, if we have a

1006
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
dynamical system that is somehow kind of

1007
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
you could sort of look at it and say it

1008
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
has a boundary or Markov blanket, that

1009
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
you can write down its dynamics as if it

1010
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
were doing free energy minimization that

1011
00:43:44,367 --> 00:44:06,383
is solving some inference problem.

1012
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,392
I think that statement is true for

1013
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
certain classes of dynamical systems, but

1014
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:22,399
I don't think the story has been made.

1015
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,403
The questions for me are like what are

1016
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
the classes and what's the essence of

1017
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:31,408
those dynamical systems?

1018
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:34,410
So the result might depend on specific

1019
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,410
technical criteria which maybe you think,

1020
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,410
okay, well, that's kind of like a

1021
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,410
distraction from this kind of abstract

1022
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:45,422
principle which we're trying to get at.

1023
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:48,425
And so it would be nice to sort of know

1024
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
what the actual essence is of the problem

1025
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:53,430
that allows us to do this translation.

1026
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,433
And then there seemed to me to be

1027
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
questions of other fairly technical

1028
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
questions, but questions about things

1029
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:04,435
like what is this boundary thing?

1030
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,437
Like how long does it persist and what

1031
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:06,437
does it mean to separate a thing off and

1032
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:11,442
consider it as having a boundary?

1033
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,446
Most of the treatments I've seen of this

1034
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:15,446
idea have not been done, have not been

1035
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:15,446
explained or expressed in this

1036
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:21,452
compositional way.

1037
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,455
And so they just assume you're given a

1038
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
system and a boundary and then that's

1039
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:28,459
kind of it.

1040
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:34,465
But boundaries come in all kinds of

1041
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,466
shapes.

1042
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,469
Like the boundaries of the cells in my

1043
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
body are kind of all like glued together

1044
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
in a particular way and they form me and

1045
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:44,475
I also have a boundary.

1046
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,480
And so how do the kind of local inference

1047
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
problems that are being solved by those

1048
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
individual cells, given their gluing

1049
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
amount to the kind of inference problem

1050
00:45:49,480 --> 00:46:01,486
that my whole body is solving?

1051
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:06,491
And I don't think an answer to that is

1052
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:08,493
anywhere near given right now.

1053
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,496
And yet, obviously we look at systems out

1054
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
in the world and they all seem to display

1055
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
this property of ReEnergy minimization or

1056
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
at least something that looks a lot like

1057
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:21,506
it.

1058
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:26,511
And so it would be nice to be able to

1059
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:26,511
relate those kind of inference problems

1060
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:31,516
to one another.

1061
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:35,520
So I think there's still a lot to be done.

1062
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,520
.

1063
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:38,523
Just because we've kind of made some

1064
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
first steps doesn't mean that we're all

1065
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:42,526
of the way there.

1066
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:45,530
Obviously, given my aesthetics, what I

1067
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,530
would love to see is this kind of

1068
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,530
abstract characterization of this

1069
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:51,536
universality.

1070
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:55,540
And I think there's a way of stating or

1071
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
at least the structure of that universal

1072
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
property using this compositional active

1073
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
inference language of which the thesis is

1074
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:07,546
a part.

1075
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:09,548
But effectively it seems to be something

1076
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:09,548
like this adjoint thing that I was

1077
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:12,551
talking about earlier.

1078
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:15,554
So on the one hand, you have something

1079
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:15,554
like a functor that takes statistical

1080
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:15,554
problems and gives you dynamical systems

1081
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:15,554
that kind of solve those inference

1082
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:26,565
problems.

1083
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,569
And so that's a functor from statistical,

1084
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
what I call statistical games into

1085
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:34,573
dynamical systems of some kind.

1086
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:36,575
But of course you have lots of dynamical

1087
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:37,576
systems.

1088
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:40,579
And so what this Bayesian mechanics idea

1089
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:40,579
seems to be saying is that you can go the

1090
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:40,579
other way as well, and maybe this mapping

1091
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:40,579
in the other direction is also functional.

1092
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:49,588
.

1093
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,591
And that would be a way of characterizing

1094
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
this kind of gluing together of dynamical

1095
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
systems like I was talking about cells

1096
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
and ending up with maybe dynamical

1097
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
statistical games that also have this

1098
00:47:52,591 --> 00:48:06,599
kind of fluing property.

1099
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:12,605
But there's still a fair amount of work

1100
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:12,605
to be done even to get the basic

1101
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:12,605
framework to sell out that story

1102
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:12,605
precisely work that I'm trying to slowly

1103
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:24,616
get on with at the moment.

1104
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:29,622
But I think the ingredients to doing this

1105
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
in the kind of generosity that I would

1106
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
like is starting to become clear and so

1107
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
hopefully we get there, but I don't think

1108
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:43,636
it's sold yet.

1109
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:47,640
Daniel: Awesome.

1110
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Yes.

1111
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:51,644
Just so cool to see all these paths

1112
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:53,646
weaving together.

1113
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:55,648
Dean.

1114
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,647
Dean: I think it's awesome, Toby, that

1115
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:00,647
you in this conversation have kind of

1116
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:00,647
anticaptured adjointness and common

1117
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:00,647
jointness because I think that's a huge

1118
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:11,658
part of your work here in reading it.

1119
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,659
Here's my question.

1120
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,663
I think, and I would like you to maybe

1121
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:16,663
comment on this as though you were

1122
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:16,663
explaining it to a very curious 15 year

1123
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:21,668
old.

1124
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:25,672
So on the sort of most basic level, when

1125
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
I hear under sort of a common jointness

1126
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
principle, the word bookkeeping, I

1127
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
immediately wonder, okay, so what is the

1128
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
partner, what's the thing that's being

1129
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:42,689
glued to, to use your metaphor?

1130
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:46,693
And so I would glue it to taking receipts,

1131
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
, essentially, where you have a

1132
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
stabilization of a record under

1133
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:54,701
bookkeeping.

1134
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,704
So I get that part and then the taking

1135
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:57,704
receipts is the stabilization of the

1136
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:02,703
change function, right?

1137
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:05,706
The exchange, something that we receive,

1138
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
those two things seem to kind of work

1139
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
together, which then allows for

1140
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
compositionality and all that other stuff.

1141
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:12,713
.

1142
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:15,716
But maybe I wonder if maybe you could

1143
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
kind of speak to this idea that something

1144
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
is presented to us and then what the

1145
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
category theory does is allow us to now

1146
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
start working with so where does this

1147
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:29,730
fit?

1148
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,733
Does this fit under this superordinate of

1149
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,735
being a tool?

1150
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:38,739
Or does it fit under this column directly,

1151
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,741
, adjacent as a rule?

1152
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:43,744
That's the part where I think the

1153
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:43,744
adjoinness could be really helpful in

1154
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:43,744
terms of maybe helping people see the

1155
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:43,744
applicability and not just the

1156
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:53,754
abstraction.

1157
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:55,756
What's your thoughts on that?

1158
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:02,757
Toby: I think David Spivak talks about

1159
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
category theory as being like a kind of

1160
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
accounting system, or accounting systems

1161
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:13,768
plural for mathematics.

1162
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,771
And I think he's kind of quite right then.

1163
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
.

1164
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:19,774
So the way I see it is when you're

1165
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
keeping books, particularly if you're

1166
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
sort of using like this double entry

1167
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
system, you're trying to keep track of

1168
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
the stuff that kind of flows into and out

1169
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
of your account, your company or whatever

1170
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
it is, without sort of missing some bits.

1171
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:43,798
.

1172
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:45,800
You see where everything goes.

1173
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:49,804
And so that's how I think of this kind of

1174
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:51,806
mathematical language.

1175
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:56,811
You have this stuff and it's kind of like

1176
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
some abstract collection of things, maybe

1177
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
mathematical ideas and well, A functor

1178
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
takes that stuff and does something with

1179
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
it and turns it into some stuff of

1180
00:51:56,811 --> 00:52:13,822
another kind.

1181
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:16,825
But it's like this kind of double entry

1182
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
idea that when you take something out of

1183
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
here, you have to put it in here and so

1184
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
you have to sort of keep track of all the

1185
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
details, at least all of the details that

1186
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
are relevant to those two, to that flow,

1187
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:32,841
I suppose.

1188
00:52:33,842 --> 00:52:36,845
And so when you have an injunction, you

1189
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
have a way of going from one place to

1190
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
another and back again without losing

1191
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:46,855
track of some stuff.

1192
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:50,859
It's like a little bit kind of like you'

1193
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
're allowed to lose track of some stuff

1194
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
but you know the stuff you've lost track

1195
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:57,865
of because you don't care about it.

1196
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:03,866
You might allow for some have some buffer

1197
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
there, but you know how big your buffer

1198
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:09,872
is, something like that.

1199
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:14,877
So more precisely, like an A junction is

1200
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
a way to map from one category to another

1201
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
and back again in such a way that the two

1202
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
mappings are kind of like ideal

1203
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
approximations of the inverse of each

1204
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
other and that you can sort of measure

1205
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:35,898
the difference between them.

1206
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:40,903
It gives you like an isomorphism between

1207
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
the two sets of morphisms of some kind

1208
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
and that that kind of gives you this nice

1209
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
kind of structure preservation property,

1210
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:50,913
this kind of bookkeeping property.

1211
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:57,920
I know that there are people out there

1212
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
who have used category theory to model

1213
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
stock flow diagrams and so these are used

1214
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
in economics to measure flows of stocks

1215
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
and things like that, but they're also

1216
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
used in epidemiology to model the

1217
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:57,920
transmission of disease because that's

1218
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:25,942
also like a flow of some stock.

1219
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:26,943
You have people moving around.

1220
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:31,948
And so it would be nice to sort of bring

1221
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:31,948
this idea full circle and have this

1222
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:31,948
mathematical language of bookkeeping

1223
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:38,955
actually applied to bookkeeping.

1224
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:42,959
But I don't know how that would go just

1225
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:42,959
yet.

1226
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:48,965
If we think of economies and corporations

1227
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
as adaptive systems or if we somehow kind

1228
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
of translate from flows of money to flows

1229
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
of information, that there does seem to

1230
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
be like an analogy between that kind of

1231
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
flow and the kind of flows that we think

1232
00:54:48,965 --> 00:55:08,979
of in active inference explicitly.

1233
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,982
And another thing, one of the things I

1234
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
like about category theory is it allows

1235
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
us to make these analogies in a precise

1236
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
way and so maybe we can relate these two

1237
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:21,992
things quite clearly.

1238
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:23,994
It's yet to be done, but I would love to

1239
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:24,995
see it.

1240
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:27,998
Daniel: Awesome.

1241
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:32,003
Dean smiles when his keywords are buzzed

1242
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:33,004
during a response.

1243
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:39,010
We'll go to another great question in the

1244
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,012
chat from Matt N.

1245
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:44,015
Matt wrote can you provide some ideas

1246
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
about the next necessary steps or

1247
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
milestones for categorical theory to be

1248
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
effectively utilized across research and

1249
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:55,026
in subsequent engineering applications?

1250
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:58,029
And I'll just kind of append to that.

1251
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:01,026
What do you think at the individual team

1252
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,028
and organizational scale?

1253
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:07,032
What can we do, what milestones exist to

1254
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
realize some of these engineering

1255
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
applications and implications that you

1256
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:13,038
brought up?

1257
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,040
Toby: Right?

1258
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,043
So I think the main thing possibly,

1259
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
unfortunately for you guys, who spent a

1260
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
lot of time reading the details that I

1261
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
wrote, is to kind of have this community

1262
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
develop to a stage where the tools that I

1263
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
mentioned that allow us to kind of use

1264
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
these category theoretic concepts

1265
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
fluently without having to know all of

1266
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
those boring and complicated details, to

1267
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
develop those to a stage where people are

1268
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
actually able to use them without being

1269
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
kind of like mathematicians or category

1270
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:53,078
theory domain experts.

1271
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,083
So this is, I think, starting to happen.

1272
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:02,081
I guess as a result of the kind of needs

1273
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:02,081
of the Pandemic, people have developed

1274
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:08,087
these tools for Epidemiology.

1275
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:10,089
I mentioned this stock flows stuff and I

1276
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
think you can probably there's like some

1277
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
I can't remember what it's called,

1278
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:16,095
unfortunately now.

1279
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:20,099
So in the Julia programming language

1280
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
there's this great framework to use for

1281
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
kind of building systems using category

1282
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:27,106
theory concepts.

1283
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:29,108
But of course this doesn't satisfy the

1284
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:29,108
property of not having to be a category

1285
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:32,111
theory domain expert.

1286
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:35,114
Yet on top of that, people have built

1287
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:35,114
using compositional ideas about dynamics,

1288
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:35,114
frameworks for building compositional,

1289
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:35,114
dynamical systems and compositional

1290
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:35,114
models for things like Epidemiology and

1291
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:48,127
stuff like that.

1292
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:51,130
And hopefully you will get there also

1293
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:51,130
with statistical modeling and active

1294
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,134
inference and all that stuff.

1295
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:58,137
But once you've got that kind of lower

1296
00:57:58,137 --> 00:57:58,137
level library, people can start to build

1297
00:57:58,137 --> 00:58:03,136
user interfaces on top of it.

1298
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:05,138
And that's the thing that's starting to

1299
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:08,141
happen now with the stock flow stuff.

1300
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:12,145
And I think that people involved in that

1301
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
project, they know that there's one kind

1302
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
of major proprietary tool for doing this

1303
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
kind of modeling which is used for it's

1304
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:26,159
used by lots of different organizations.

1305
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,161
For instance, it was used by governments

1306
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,163
for modeling during the Pandemic.

1307
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,166
But it's not very collaborative, it's not

1308
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,168
compositional.

1309
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:37,170
So if you have this huge model, it's very

1310
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:37,170
hard to deal with, to modulate just some

1311
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,174
small part of it.

1312
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,177
And so these people, as I say, it's very

1313
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
unfortunate.

1314
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:47,180
I can't remember all their names or the

1315
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,180
name of the software, but they're

1316
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,180
building this tool which allows you to

1317
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,180
build out these models just using this

1318
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:55,188
interface.

1319
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:57,190
But it's built out of this compositional

1320
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,190
stuff and so it has a lot of the nice

1321
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,187
properties that come out of it.

1322
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:03,190
And of course, if you want, you can sort

1323
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
of delve under the hood and understand

1324
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
actually how it works and connect it to

1325
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
all this other stuff and maybe down the

1326
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
line when we've got really advanced tools

1327
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
that that will kind of be able to be done

1328
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:16,203
for free and some nice user interface.

1329
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:20,207
But I think so if people want to make the

1330
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
most of this, they could sort of get

1331
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
involved with that kind of effort or at

1332
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
least they could sort of get familiar

1333
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
with the kind of basic ideas of

1334
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
categorical modeling or compositional

1335
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:39,226
thinking, as I like to say these days.

1336
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:44,231
But I also don't want to prescribe to

1337
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:44,231
people they have to know what like a

1338
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:44,231
monad is and all that stuff because, you

1339
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:44,231
know, there are it is technical, it has

1340
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:44,231
to be technical because it's about

1341
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:54,241
technical stuff.

1342
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:57,244
But I mean, it's also trying to be

1343
00:59:57,244 --> 00:59:57,244
ergonomic and if that's your thing, you

1344
00:59:57,244 --> 01:00:03,527
can try to help make it more so.

1345
01:00:07,713 --> 01:00:09,093
Daniel: Awesome Dean.

1346
01:00:11,286 --> 01:00:14,580
Dean: No, I'm waiting because there's a

1347
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:14,580
part of the paper that the belief

1348
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:14,580
updating and the fuzzy of distributions

1349
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:21,221
and stuff.

1350
01:00:21,228 --> 01:00:24,502
I'm going to want to talk about that

1351
01:00:24,502 --> 01:00:26,722
later, but I'm done for now.

1352
01:00:28,903 --> 01:00:30,184
Daniel: All right, I'll go to a question

1353
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:30,184
submitted by Jr also who created the

1354
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:34,515
syllabus.

1355
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:36,769
So thanks again Jr, for that amazing work.

1356
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:36,769
.

1357
01:00:36,775 --> 01:00:37,842
So Jr.

1358
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:41,241
Wrote in compositional active Inference

1359
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:43,432
from May 17, 2021.

1360
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:46,751
Toby said I'm with Valeria on this.

1361
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:48,972
I think we need to seek AI alignment for

1362
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:48,972
the artificial intelligences that we

1363
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:48,972
already have things like corporations and

1364
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:48,972
social systems and we should be

1365
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:56,739
concentrating on those right now.

1366
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:59,000
Could you speak more about how you

1367
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,636
envision this kind of application?

1368
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:04,979
This is especially interesting in light

1369
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:04,979
of what we spoke about in the 54.0

1370
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:10,592
regarding sensor fusion and consensus.

1371
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:13,854
What might this mean for corporations and

1372
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:14,950
social systems?

1373
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:17,211
Toby, do you mean that this between

1374
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:17,211
humans and things kind of like artificial

1375
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:17,211
intelligences or machines and artificial

1376
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:17,211
intelligences in the context of companies

1377
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:26,119
and societies?

1378
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:31,616
Toby: Yeah, that's a great question and I

1379
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:31,616
think Jr has done a great job with the

1380
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:36,125
syllabus, which I also had a look at.

1381
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:42,754
Yeah, I think it's a good list of

1382
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:42,754
material and concepts to sort of get to

1383
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:42,754
grips with, but as per yeah, AI alignment,

1384
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:56,111
, it's a very vexed issue.

1385
01:01:56,112 --> 01:02:00,091
Of course, I put this to people who are

1386
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:00,091
involved in the AI safety community and

1387
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:00,091
some of them say, oh well, we concentrate

1388
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:00,091
on machine intelligent rather than

1389
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:00,091
corporations because there's like no hope

1390
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:18,278
for making corporations safe.

1391
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:21,306
Like it's too late, they're already out

1392
01:02:21,306 --> 01:02:23,326
there so we can't fix that.

1393
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,348
Which is obviously a very sort of

1394
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:25,348
defeatist attitude, but maybe it's right

1395
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:25,348
to concentrate on a matter where they

1396
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:25,348
think that they can actually have an

1397
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:33,425
influence.

1398
01:02:35,444 --> 01:02:38,478
But I do nonetheless still think that

1399
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:38,478
corporations are like super intelligences.

1400
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:42,517
.

1401
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,563
They've been made out of code, but the

1402
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:47,563
code isn't a traditional computer

1403
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:52,618
programming language.

1404
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:56,649
It's the legal programming language that

1405
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:57,669
makes up their contracts.

1406
01:02:58,672 --> 01:03:00,636
But those contracts determine how they

1407
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:00,636
operate and are executed on a thing,

1408
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:00,636
which is a bit like a computer, like the

1409
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:06,693
legal system.

1410
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:09,725
You go in a court, it processes the

1411
01:03:09,725 --> 01:03:09,725
contract and it explains what the outcome

1412
01:03:09,725 --> 01:03:13,761
is going to be.

1413
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:16,798
It's like a computer, but it's like made

1414
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:16,798
up of people and they have goals and

1415
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:16,798
desires and they take actions and they

1416
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:26,896
receive information from the world.

1417
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:30,933
And so, yeah, they're a lot like, well,

1418
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:31,945
AI systems.

1419
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:33,965
But it's nice because we can pun on AI

1420
01:03:33,965 --> 01:03:33,965
and have it mean both artificial

1421
01:03:33,965 --> 01:03:37,002
intelligence and active inference.

1422
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,049
That's like a long preamble.

1423
01:03:43,062 --> 01:03:46,095
One of the things that at least as far as

1424
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:46,095
I know right now, the active inference

1425
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:46,095
literature doesn't talk an awful lot

1426
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:46,095
about, at least not very precisely, is

1427
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:58,215
this notion of sense of fusion.

1428
01:03:58,215 --> 01:04:02,190
So you can have like two say you have

1429
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,203
like two yeah.

1430
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,231
So if you think about the brain, again,

1431
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:06,231
you've got two little neural circuits

1432
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:06,231
next to each other and they're making

1433
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:06,231
predictions about two visual receptive

1434
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:14,319
fields.

1435
01:04:15,326 --> 01:04:17,347
But those visual receptive fields, they

1436
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:18,359
kind of often overlap.

1437
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:23,405
And so what we might want a system like

1438
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:23,405
the brain to do is to be able to kind of

1439
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:23,405
glue the two inferences that those

1440
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:23,405
circuits make together over this overlap

1441
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:41,587
so that you get this unitary perception.

1442
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:44,618
We don't just see a bunch of independent

1443
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:46,635
patches of the world.

1444
01:04:46,635 --> 01:04:49,666
We see this kind of glued together thing,

1445
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:49,666
even though the way it's been inferred is

1446
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:49,666
through lots of individual systems next

1447
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:56,738
to one another.

1448
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:01,728
And so it's quite clear how to put two

1449
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:01,728
things next to each other mathematically.

1450
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:05,769
.

1451
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:09,807
You just take their sort of product, then

1452
01:05:09,807 --> 01:05:12,834
you just do them side by side.

1453
01:05:12,835 --> 01:05:16,870
But when you want them to sort of glue

1454
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:16,870
together in this way, you might encounter

1455
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:21,923
some problems.

1456
01:05:21,925 --> 01:05:23,941
Like you might have one make one

1457
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:23,941
inference and one make another inference.

1458
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:25,962
.

1459
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:27,988
And so you get like a disagreement and

1460
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:27,988
then you need to start to say, okay, well,

1461
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:32,032
, what's going on there?

1462
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:34,051
What is the nature of this disagreement?

1463
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:37,083
Is it something that can be resolved by,

1464
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:37,083
say, passing some messages between the

1465
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:41,123
two systems?

1466
01:05:41,123 --> 01:05:44,151
Or do we need to just ignore some of the

1467
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:44,156
data?

1468
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:47,182
Or is there fundamentally some paradox

1469
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:47,182
which means that we can't resolve this

1470
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:50,219
disagreement?

1471
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:56,274
And so in mathematics, there's a lot of

1472
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:56,274
theory that's been done about precisely

1473
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:56,274
this question in topology in a kind of

1474
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:56,274
abstract way related to the field of what'

1475
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:56,274
's called cohomology, which is all about

1476
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:56,274
measuring obstructions to doing this kind

1477
01:05:56,274 --> 01:06:15,403
of gluing thing.

1478
01:06:15,408 --> 01:06:18,437
And sort of in this world of applied

1479
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:18,437
topology, people talk about algorithms

1480
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:18,437
for resolving disagreements and things

1481
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:18,437
like that, and they often have the flavor

1482
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:29,547
of diffusion.

1483
01:06:29,547 --> 01:06:32,573
You can sort of think of diffusion as

1484
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:32,573
like smoothing out disagreements because

1485
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:32,573
you're just sort of like letting stuff

1486
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:39,646
propagate something.

1487
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:42,672
There maybe could be said about how these

1488
01:06:42,672 --> 01:06:42,672
diffusion models work in generative AI,

1489
01:06:42,672 --> 01:06:47,722
but I haven't really thought about that.

1490
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:52,778
And so maybe there's something to be done

1491
01:06:52,778 --> 01:06:56,814
for political systems or corporations.

1492
01:06:56,815 --> 01:06:59,842
Like, maybe we can look at how the

1493
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
mathematics says we can resolve these

1494
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
disagreements and implement better

1495
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
processes in our organizations that are

1496
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
inspired by those algorithms or kind of

1497
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
universal properties and maybe that'll

1498
01:06:59,842 --> 01:06:59,842
make the world a kind of more harmonious

1499
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:18,976
place.

1500
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:22,010
Or maybe it will just help us build

1501
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,010
systems in the future which resolve

1502
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:27,064
disagreements better.

1503
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:31,101
And this is one of the reasons why I was

1504
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:31,101
talking about multi agent systems before.

1505
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:35,140
.

1506
01:07:36,154 --> 01:07:38,176
I know this is a thing that sometimes

1507
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:38,176
people think about in the context of

1508
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:38,176
blockchain systems and things like that,

1509
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:38,176
which are actually actively composed of

1510
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:47,263
lots of different participants.

1511
01:07:49,286 --> 01:07:56,356
But I don't know yet how it might all pan

1512
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:57,364
out.

1513
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:01,340
I mean, ultimately the question of

1514
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:01,340
alignment is really about do the goals of

1515
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:01,340
this other system disagree with my

1516
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:09,425
goals?

1517
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:12,456
And if the other system has more power

1518
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:12,456
than you, then ultimately there's

1519
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:12,456
probably not much you can do about it,

1520
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:12,456
regardless of whether there exists some

1521
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:12,456
algorithm that might help you smooth it

1522
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:25,581
out.

1523
01:08:26,592 --> 01:08:29,626
So I hope at least that by looking at how

1524
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
the mathematics says, we can optimally

1525
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
resolve disagreements or smooth them out

1526
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
or patch things together or build kind of

1527
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
multi agent system that will help us

1528
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
build things in the future in such a way

1529
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
that we don't get to a situation where

1530
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:29,626
the systems we're working with are

1531
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:54,877
actually aligned against us.

1532
01:08:54,878 --> 01:08:55,884
Say.

1533
01:08:56,893 --> 01:08:57,909
But obviously we can't really guarantee

1534
01:08:57,909 --> 01:08:58,910
it.

1535
01:08:58,911 --> 01:08:59,927
We actually have to sort of do some work.

1536
01:08:59,927 --> 01:08:59,927
.

1537
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,901
But it's nice that at least the framework

1538
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:03,901
of active inference allows us to talk

1539
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:08,954
about that at least, right?

1540
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:11,982
So we can say like, oh, I have these

1541
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
beliefs about the world and this other

1542
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
agent has these beliefs about the world

1543
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
and then we can express these beliefs in

1544
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
a mathematical framework which is

1545
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
amenable to using these tools from

1546
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
cohomology and applied topology to be

1547
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:11,982
able to start to make use of that work

1548
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:33,201
that's already been done.

1549
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,238
It's to me not so clear how you would do

1550
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:36,238
that if you're not working in this active

1551
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:36,238
inference world and you're working, say,

1552
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:44,315
with just reinforcement learning.

1553
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:51,384
I know there are similar questions about

1554
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:51,384
how to kind of glue together preference

1555
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:57,445
functions in economics.

1556
01:09:58,452 --> 01:10:01,421
And I think for me, the simplest way to

1557
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:01,421
kind of understand those questions is to

1558
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:01,421
kind of turn those preference functions

1559
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:01,421
into distributions over states and then

1560
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:01,421
use this kind of sort of more active

1561
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:15,566
inference language to think about it.

1562
01:10:16,574 --> 01:10:19,604
So, yeah, again, we're just at the start

1563
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:19,604
of this process, but it sounds like we

1564
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:19,604
should be able to make use of this wealth

1565
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:19,604
of tooling which has been developed in

1566
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:29,705
other fields.

1567
01:10:29,706 --> 01:10:32,736
Because we're putting this into this kind

1568
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:32,736
of modular categorical language, we

1569
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:32,736
should be able to kind of put these two

1570
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:32,736
modules together and make make the most

1571
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:41,825
of them.

1572
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:44,853
Daniel: Thanks.

1573
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:47,880
I'm going to go to a different sort of

1574
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,890
question here.

1575
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:51,925
I'm going to play dissertation roulette

1576
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:51,925
but I kind of know where I'm going to go

1577
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:57,988
and I'm going to skip to a diagram.

1578
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,966
It's a diagram at the end of chapter six,

1579
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,987
and it looks like this.

1580
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:07,029
So what do we see here?

1581
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:12,079
What happens in this graphical

1582
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:14,095
arrangement?

1583
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:18,132
It doesn't have to be ultra specific

1584
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:18,132
about defining every variable, but is

1585
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:18,132
what matters here that's apology or the

1586
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:24,199
geometry?

1587
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,224
Is it an arbitrary visual layout, but you'

1588
01:11:27,224 --> 01:11:27,224
're conveying something about the

1589
01:11:27,224 --> 01:11:30,249
connectivity?

1590
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,267
Or is it read from left to right?

1591
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:34,291
Or is there a certain way to understand

1592
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:34,291
or just approach these diagrams which in

1593
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:34,291
slightly smaller forms or larger forms we

1594
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:34,291
see peppered throughout category theory

1595
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:42,376
and your dissertation?

1596
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:44,389
Toby: Okay.

1597
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,394
Yeah.

1598
01:11:44,394 --> 01:11:49,443
So here what I'm trying to do is say that

1599
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:49,443
if you have a hierarchical predictive

1600
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:49,443
coding system, if you take the form of

1601
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:49,443
two parts that are sort of plugged into

1602
01:11:49,443 --> 01:12:07,562
one another and this is the the G.

1603
01:12:07,563 --> 01:12:11,609
And the H, if you, like, do predictive

1604
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:11,609
coding on G and you sort of plug that

1605
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:11,609
into H, and then you do predictive coding

1606
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:24,734
on H with that input.

1607
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,777
It's the same thing as doing predictive

1608
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:28,777
coding directly on the two parts as if

1609
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:35,847
they were one thing at the start.

1610
01:12:35,848 --> 01:12:39,880
So what I mean is, if you have here we've

1611
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,906
got like a hierarchical system.

1612
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:46,950
Again, the parts of the hierarchy are G

1613
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:46,955
and H.

1614
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,986
And we could do two things.

1615
01:12:49,986 --> 01:12:53,021
We could either apply predictive coding

1616
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:53,021
to the two parts and then glue those

1617
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:53,021
predictive coding systems together, or we

1618
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:53,021
could glue like the G and H together and

1619
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:53,021
then apply predictive coding to GH the

1620
01:12:53,021 --> 01:13:08,115
Glued system.

1621
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,147
And what this bit of this result is

1622
01:13:11,147 --> 01:13:11,147
saying is if you do those two processes,

1623
01:13:11,147 --> 01:13:16,195
you get the same dynamical system.

1624
01:13:16,196 --> 01:13:19,229
And that's saying that this predictive

1625
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:19,229
coding thing, at least with this sort of

1626
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:26,294
Laplacian scheme, is functional.

1627
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:32,351
So in this diagram, it is read from left

1628
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:33,363
to right.

1629
01:13:33,364 --> 01:13:35,386
I mean, some sense you can orient these

1630
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:35,386
diagrams however you want as long as you'

1631
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:35,386
're clear about how the information flows.

1632
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:40,434
.

1633
01:13:41,445 --> 01:13:46,496
And if I remember rightly, what we've got

1634
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:46,496
is we've got some like yes, we've got X

1635
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:52,555
and Y.

1636
01:13:59,624 --> 01:14:01,587
We've got one system which is predicting

1637
01:14:01,587 --> 01:14:03,609
X and one system which is predicting Y.

1638
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:06,634
And I'm not totally sure what P and Q are,

1639
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:08,656
, but I guess they relate to X and Y.

1640
01:14:10,677 --> 01:14:14,712
And you've got some stuff that's coming

1641
01:14:14,712 --> 01:14:14,712
into the predictive coding system, h of G

1642
01:14:14,712 --> 01:14:14,712
and some other stuff which is coming in

1643
01:14:14,712 --> 01:14:23,807
and going to H of H.

1644
01:14:24,813 --> 01:14:26,838
And these give you like updated states.

1645
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,870
So in predictive coding with this LaPlace

1646
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
algorithm, what happens is that you get

1647
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
this new observation that comes in and

1648
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
you look at the error between that

1649
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
observation and your prediction and you

1650
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
update your prediction according to the

1651
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,870
sort of direction that error points you

1652
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:48,050
in.

1653
01:14:48,057 --> 01:14:51,080
And so that's what these HG and HH

1654
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,092
systems are doing.

1655
01:14:53,102 --> 01:14:58,152
But because it's a hierarchical system,

1656
01:14:58,152 --> 01:15:02,133
this second layer, which this.

1657
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:05,163
Second layer requires you to take in the

1658
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:07,187
prediction of the first layer.

1659
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:13,242
So if you sort of follow in the flow of

1660
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:13,242
information, HH takes in inputs from

1661
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:19,302
Gamma.

1662
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:23,348
Gamma is the kind of the predictive

1663
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:27,388
channel, the predictive part of G.

1664
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,423
And so that feeds into H.

1665
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:38,499
And the update of G, which is a sort of

1666
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:38,499
layer above H, requires this newly

1667
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:47,579
updated belief from H.

1668
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:47,582
Right?

1669
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,611
So that's going sort of up in the causal

1670
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:50,618
hierarchy.

1671
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:57,680
And so if you sort of follow the flow in

1672
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:57,680
as well into this G update function at

1673
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:57,680
the top H of G, you see that it gets an

1674
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:07,725
input from this sigma function.

1675
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:15,803
And that's the new belief emitted by the

1676
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:16,819
H system.

1677
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,843
In this part of the proof, at least that

1678
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:20,856
was the notation I used.

1679
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:24,892
And so this is just saying, if you do

1680
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:24,892
predictive coding on these two bits, it

1681
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:24,892
has this structure which is you do the

1682
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:24,892
forwards pass down through the system G

1683
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:24,892
and then H, and that gives you a

1684
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:39,044
prediction at the kind of lowest level.

1685
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:43,086
And then you take your observation, which

1686
01:16:43,086 --> 01:16:47,124
is, I think, thing you get in here in Z.

1687
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:48,137
Yeah, that's what Z is.

1688
01:16:48,138 --> 01:16:50,150
It goes into H.

1689
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,187
You get an updated belief that comes out

1690
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:53,187
in the form of the sigma and then gets

1691
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:53,187
passed to the first level of the

1692
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:53,187
hierarchy, which is used to give you the

1693
01:16:53,187 --> 01:17:06,253
highest level of belief.

1694
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:10,296
Great.

1695
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:13,325
Daniel: Well, it's awesome because in so

1696
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:13,325
many papers we see what I guess people

1697
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:13,325
expect and prefer, which is you should be

1698
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:13,325
able to make a nested model here and have

1699
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:13,325
communicating agents here and do

1700
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:13,325
sophisticated affective inference in this

1701
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:28,470
way.

1702
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:30,499
And it's like we're already playing with

1703
01:17:30,499 --> 01:17:30,499
the Legos in a sense, and talking about

1704
01:17:30,499 --> 01:17:35,549
it like it's a total play shop.

1705
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:40,590
So to understand in a way that is worthy

1706
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:40,590
of dissertation research, some of that

1707
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:47,665
substrate, it's basic Lego research.

1708
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:51,702
And how do you know when you're working,

1709
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:53,729
you describe this as a result?

1710
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:55,746
How do we know?

1711
01:17:55,747 --> 01:17:57,769
I mean, can I just draw a line from here

1712
01:17:57,769 --> 01:17:58,774
to here?

1713
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:02,754
Or can I just make a D and just have D

1714
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:04,773
connect to Gamma?

1715
01:18:04,777 --> 01:18:08,810
What rules do you keep a guidebook or

1716
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:09,828
recipe on the table?

1717
01:18:10,832 --> 01:18:14,874
What rules help us know what edges and

1718
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:17,902
shapes you can even draw?

1719
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:21,948
And when you describe the manual checking,

1720
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:25,982
, are you looking for what right?

1721
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:27,000
Toby: Yeah, this is a good question.

1722
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:31,004
It is like a language.

1723
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:33,006
So it has a syntax.

1724
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:38,011
And that syntax is like the I mean, it's

1725
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:40,013
like the grammar, right?

1726
01:18:40,013 --> 01:18:46,019
And it tells you what things make sense

1727
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:52,025
to say and so you only say those things.

1728
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
Daniel: Don't we all?

1729
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:56,029
Don't we all?

1730
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:58,031
Toby: No, but that but it's, it's it's

1731
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
that's what I am laughing because often

1732
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
you want to like play with the grammar,

1733
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:03,030
right?

1734
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,032
And so sometimes you're like, oh, it

1735
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:05,032
feels like I'm not allowed to draw this

1736
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:09,036
thing.

1737
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,038
I'm not allowed to connect this box to

1738
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
this other box in this way, but I really

1739
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,038
want to do that, and that's not a bad

1740
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:17,044
thing.

1741
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:20,047
You shouldn't do it in that diagram where

1742
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
it doesn't make sense, but you should

1743
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
take that feeling and reflect on it and

1744
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
say, but that's saying that maybe this

1745
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
diagram syntax is missing something

1746
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:30,057
important.

1747
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:34,061
And then you should trust your intuitions

1748
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:34,061
there and say, okay, well, actually, what

1749
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:34,061
do I need to do to this diagram language

1750
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:34,061
to make it allow me to do that move that

1751
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:34,061
I wanted to do to draw that thing I

1752
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:49,076
wanted to draw?

1753
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:53,080
And so that suggests that you're walking

1754
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,080
through, like, a valley, and you can see

1755
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,080
there's a hill over here, and there's

1756
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:00,081
something peeking out over it.

1757
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:01,082
And you're like, actually, there's

1758
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:01,082
something over there I need to be able to

1759
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:03,084
see.

1760
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:06,087
And so you have to move over towards a

1761
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:06,087
different place to be able to get to that

1762
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:10,091
place.

1763
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:14,095
And so you should do that right then.

1764
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:15,096
That's fine.

1765
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:17,098
But the reason why I said at the

1766
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
beginning, don't just draw it in your

1767
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
diagram is because then that means your

1768
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
diagram doesn't mean anything, and that's

1769
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:24,105
worse.

1770
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:27,107
So this is part of the reason that it

1771
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:27,107
actually requires using this kind of

1772
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:31,112
mathematical formalism.

1773
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:34,115
Really, using mathematics generally

1774
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:34,115
requires this discipline because you don'

1775
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:34,115
't want to say things that don't make

1776
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:40,121
sense.

1777
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:44,125
If you have an intuition, you should do

1778
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,128
it justice and treat it seriously.

1779
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:50,131
And you probably get more out of it by

1780
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:52,133
figuring out what's missing.

1781
01:20:53,134 --> 01:20:55,136
So with this particular kind of string

1782
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
diagram language, you can't just get used

1783
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:59,140
to reading them right?

1784
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,136
So you know that these little black dots

1785
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:03,138
mean copy some information.

1786
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,141
So if you see the first one or like, the

1787
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:06,141
second one on Y, you go from Y, you go

1788
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:06,141
into this copier and you just send the

1789
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:15,150
information to both of those outputs.

1790
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:20,154
If you read like Bob Cooker's work or say,

1791
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:20,154
, his book on his book Picturing Quantum

1792
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:20,154
Processes, which is all about quantum

1793
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:20,154
theory, using this string diagram

1794
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:20,154
language, there are lots of different

1795
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:20,154
rules for stuff you can do with these

1796
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:41,175
languages.

1797
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:43,178
Like you have colored spiders, he calls

1798
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:43,178
them, which are like colored versions of

1799
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:47,182
these black dots.

1800
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:51,186
And there are things you're allowed to do.

1801
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:51,186
.

1802
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:53,188
Like if you have two spiders next to each

1803
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:53,188
other that are the same color, you can

1804
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:53,188
sort of merge them to be a spider with as

1805
01:21:53,188 --> 01:22:01,190
many legs as the two of them.

1806
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,192
And if they don't have the same color,

1807
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:04,193
then you can sort of split them apart.

1808
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:10,199
And those kinds of moves are like part of

1809
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:10,199
the syntax of this language, but it's a

1810
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:16,205
human language.

1811
01:22:16,205 --> 01:22:18,207
And so people developed it, and they

1812
01:22:18,207 --> 01:22:18,207
realized that they could do some things,

1813
01:22:18,207 --> 01:22:18,207
and they realized that they couldn't do

1814
01:22:18,207 --> 01:22:23,212
others.

1815
01:22:23,212 --> 01:22:26,215
And they tried to make the rules of the

1816
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:26,215
game match the things they wanted to do,

1817
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:26,215
and they ended up with this language

1818
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:26,215
which is now used a lot in quantum

1819
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:26,215
computing because it's a very sort of

1820
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:40,229
natural language for that problem.

1821
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:48,237
So as to how do you know what kinds of

1822
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:50,239
things to draw?

1823
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,242
Well, here, like I was trying to prove

1824
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:53,242
functionality, which is a sort of general

1825
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:57,246
property.

1826
01:22:58,247 --> 01:23:01,244
And it says the thing it says, in an

1827
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
abstract way, the thing that I started by

1828
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:01,244
saying, which is there I wanted H of G h

1829
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:12,255
to be the same as H.

1830
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:12,255
Yeah.

1831
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:15,258
See here, if you see this line, the

1832
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:15,258
update map of the composite system, you

1833
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:21,264
see I've got HH after HG.

1834
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:24,267
Well, I want that to be the same as H

1835
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:26,269
just applied to H after G.

1836
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:28,271
And so that says, okay, well, I want

1837
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:31,273
these two things to be equal.

1838
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:33,276
And so what I do is I draw the two

1839
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
diagrams for the two parts, and you draw

1840
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
them out, and first of all, they don't

1841
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:40,283
look equal.

1842
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:41,284
And you're like, oh, that's annoying.

1843
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:43,286
But then you stare at it for a bit and

1844
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:43,286
you reflect on the kind of moves that you'

1845
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:47,290
're allowed to make.

1846
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:50,293
You think, well, okay, maybe I can apply

1847
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:50,293
this move, and it makes the diagrams look

1848
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:50,293
a bit more similar, and eventually you

1849
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:58,301
make the diagrams look the same.

1850
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:01,298
You've only used rules that you're

1851
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:02,299
allowed to use.

1852
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,301
I see.

1853
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:07,304
Sort of skimming through to see if it

1854
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:07,304
looks like that directly in the thesis,

1855
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:12,309
but effectively, that's what's going on.

1856
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,312
It's just that the rules are a little bit

1857
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:16,313
abstract, though.

1858
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:20,317
That being said, I know that Pavel

1859
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
Sobachinsky, who's researcher in category

1860
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
theory at Tallinn, he's got a project

1861
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
with a colleague of his to build a mobile

1862
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
game, which is all about making string

1863
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:40,337
diagrams equal in this way.

1864
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:45,342
And so the idea is that in this game, you

1865
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
have pictures like this, and you've got

1866
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
certain moves you can do to manipulate

1867
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:51,348
the pictures.

1868
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:58,355
And the sort of aim of the game is to

1869
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:58,355
transform one starting picture into the

1870
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:58,355
sort of goal picture just by applying

1871
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:05,356
these moves.

1872
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:08,359
And as you go through the game, the kind

1873
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:08,359
of moves you can do become more

1874
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:10,361
complicated.

1875
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:14,365
But it's I mean, it's the same kind of

1876
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:14,365
process.

1877
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:18,368
I'm not sure the game is at the stage now

1878
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
where you're allowed to do this human

1879
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
creative thing and think, actually, I

1880
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
want to make there be a new kind of move,

1881
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
or change the diagrams or add in a color

1882
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
here or something that's a really human

1883
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:18,368
thing and designed to say you shouldn't

1884
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:36,387
do that.

1885
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:38,389
But I'm just trying to advocate for doing

1886
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:40,390
that in a way which is also rigorous.

1887
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:43,394
Daniel: Awesome.

1888
01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:49,400
Yes, to speak fluently the syntax and the

1889
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
grammar, whether we're talking about

1890
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
natural human language or we're talking

1891
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
about the active inference ontology, we

1892
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
want the syntax to be unobtrusive, if not

1893
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
compressient, so that we can actually

1894
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
convey the semantics, because that's the

1895
01:25:49,400 --> 01:26:12,417
real information flow.

1896
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,421
The syntax is within the Shannon signal

1897
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,422
entropy space.

1898
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,426
And then in live stream 17 and 40 and the

1899
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
physics as information processing with

1900
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
Chris Fields where we've been exploring

1901
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
these semantic Bayesian information flows

1902
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
that must, out of necessity, to be

1903
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
enriched beyond the syntax, have to

1904
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
include an individual or shared context

1905
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
that flow necessitates the proper syntax.

1906
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:45,449
.

1907
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:50,455
And so it's just part of the learning.

1908
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:54,458
And so it's exciting to see that there's

1909
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:54,458
games and work like yours and others to

1910
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:54,458
help because if we could play with those

1911
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:54,458
Legos and get the instantaneous feedback

1912
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:54,458
just like learning with a language tutor

1913
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:54,458
of like, no, these two pieces, they don't

1914
01:26:54,458 --> 01:27:13,472
fit together.

1915
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:17,476
And then we kind of would actively infer

1916
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
patterns, make our own rules and

1917
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
understandings, but there would be

1918
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
certain compositionality of the system

1919
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:27,486
itself.

1920
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:30,489
And so it's interesting to think of like

1921
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:32,491
you described it as a natural language.

1922
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:35,494
It is technical and naturally arising.

1923
01:27:35,494 --> 01:27:38,497
And our natural language, without going

1924
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
too much into the superior wharf and

1925
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
everything like that, it reflects the

1926
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
kind of subject, object, verb structure

1927
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:48,507
that we often want to convey.

1928
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:53,512
This is a natural language for science.

1929
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:56,515
It conveys what we want to convey.

1930
01:27:56,515 --> 01:28:00,513
And so being able to do that in a way

1931
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:00,513
that is both disciplined and rigorous,

1932
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:00,513
also enabling low cognitive overhead

1933
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:00,513
fluency for some individuals today, but

1934
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:00,513
for more tomorrow, that's just extremely

1935
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:16,529
powerful.

1936
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:19,532
And the fact that it has such a beautiful

1937
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
and intuitive way to graphically

1938
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
represent it is very promising because

1939
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
that may tap us into a more holistic

1940
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
understanding and a visual field or a

1941
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
felt sense understanding that just

1942
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
looking at this and someone says, wait,

1943
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
this is what we learn in active inference.

1944
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:41,554
.

1945
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:43,556
It's like, well, no, that's not even the

1946
01:28:43,556 --> 01:28:44,557
tip of the iceberg.

1947
01:28:44,557 --> 01:28:45,558
There's so much more to it.

1948
01:28:45,558 --> 01:28:48,561
And it's not only this and all of that,

1949
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
but it's one of the pieces that at this

1950
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
moment in time, in our sort of early

1951
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
calculator phase or Abacus phase, almost,

1952
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
it's one of those things that we're

1953
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
tackling, but it's the wave that we're

1954
01:28:48,561 --> 01:29:05,572
riding.

1955
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:09,576
And I just can't wait until there's more

1956
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:09,576
accessibility and the learning pathways

1957
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:15,582
and the playgrounds to use all this.

1958
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:17,584
Toby: Yeah, I mean, I totally agree with

1959
01:29:17,584 --> 01:29:18,585
all of that.

1960
01:29:18,585 --> 01:29:21,588
And I think it was nice to see the gr in

1961
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:21,588
this syllabus that included references to

1962
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:21,588
Eugenia Cheng's work because she's done a

1963
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:21,588
lot of great work to kind of make

1964
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:35,602
mathematics more accessible in this way.

1965
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:40,607
She had an article in the Guardian, like,

1966
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:40,607
in the last week or so, even talking

1967
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:40,607
about mathematics education and how it

1968
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:40,607
often, like, scares people because they'

1969
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:51,618
're taught to.

1970
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:53,620
Like, you just apply algorithms in this

1971
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:53,620
kind of blind way to do, like,

1972
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:53,620
multiplication or calculus or whatever

1973
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:53,620
and not really play with the concepts in

1974
01:29:53,620 --> 01:30:03,624
the way that I was trying to say.

1975
01:30:03,624 --> 01:30:06,627
Okay, well, you're drawing these diagrams

1976
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:08,629
and you want to play with them.

1977
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:12,633
And it would be nice to see mathematics

1978
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:12,633
education take this kind of more playful

1979
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:18,638
route to start with.

1980
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,641
One of the things that Eugenia says in

1981
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:20,641
this article is that unfortunately, that

1982
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:20,641
would make things kind of slower because

1983
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:29,650
you just want people to muck around.

1984
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:32,653
You don't want people just to be able to

1985
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:34,655
churn out this kind of computation.

1986
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:36,657
But in this future where our

1987
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
computational tools are so powerful,

1988
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
maybe we don't all need to be perfect

1989
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
integrators or like derivators and be

1990
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:49,670
able to multiply numbers quickly.

1991
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,672
And some people like doing long division,

1992
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
but I don't even remember how to do long

1993
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:53,674
division.

1994
01:30:53,674 --> 01:30:54,675
Why would I?

1995
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:58,679
It's silly to kind of drill that into

1996
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:58,679
children.

1997
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:03,678
So there have been projects to teach,

1998
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
like kindergarten children, like a couple

1999
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:10,685
of projects, not many.

2000
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:14,689
Some of the kind of rules of this string

2001
01:31:14,689 --> 01:31:14,689
diagrammatic stuff in this quantum

2002
01:31:14,689 --> 01:31:20,695
information processing world.

2003
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:25,700
Bob Cocker and his colleagues I think

2004
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
there was one project by Dan Geeker in

2005
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
Birmingham and maybe one by Bob himself,

2006
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
or at least he was trying to get it off

2007
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:35,710
the ground.

2008
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:36,711
I don't remember.

2009
01:31:36,711 --> 01:31:40,715
But at least where it has been tried, I

2010
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:40,715
think they found that children very

2011
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:40,715
easily learn to use these kinds of

2012
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:40,715
languages because it's just playing with

2013
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:52,727
pictures.

2014
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:55,730
They're kind of much more approachable

2015
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:55,730
than this kind of scary symbolic language,

2016
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:55,730
, which is it's a kind of fine language

2017
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:55,730
if you're used to typing on a typewriter

2018
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:55,730
or like writing by hand, where you write

2019
01:31:55,730 --> 01:32:12,741
in this linear way.

2020
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:15,744
But if you go to a mathematics department

2021
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:15,744
and look at the whiteboards or the

2022
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:15,744
chalkboards there, most of the time you

2023
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:15,744
see lots of pictures, diagrams and things.

2024
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:25,754
.

2025
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:27,756
And that's how people reason, typically.

2026
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:32,761
And so a lot of what's been happening

2027
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
with applied category theory is trying to

2028
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
take using diagrams seriously as

2029
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
mathematics and trying to say, okay, well,

2030
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:32,761
, here's what we can do if we do take it

2031
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:48,777
seriously.

2032
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:52,781
We can sort of recapitulate some of these

2033
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:52,781
things which people have found like

2034
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:52,781
abstract or abstruse or difficult in

2035
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:52,781
mathematics before and make them seem a

2036
01:32:52,781 --> 01:33:07,790
bit more easy to reason with.

2037
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:07,790
Now.

2038
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,793
That applies to abstract things like

2039
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:10,793
stuff I've mentioned already, like

2040
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:10,793
adjunctions, like the laws of adjunctions.

2041
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:14,797
.

2042
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,800
You can draw them with think string

2043
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:17,800
diagrams.

2044
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,803
I haven't shown it in my thesis.

2045
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:24,807
But if you sort of Google around, you can

2046
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:24,807
see adjunctions in a two category and

2047
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:24,807
they end up being some kind of snaky

2048
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:30,813
picture.

2049
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:33,816
And sort of you get a sense of what's

2050
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:33,816
going on there from these pictures, like

2051
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:38,821
the flow of information in some sense.

2052
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,825
And there's a similar thing with Monads.

2053
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,827
The joke for functional programmers about

2054
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:44,827
Monads is like, oh, you don't know what a

2055
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:48,831
Monad is?

2056
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:50,833
Well, it's just a monoid in the category

2057
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:51,834
of endofunctors.

2058
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:52,835
And I mean, that's true.

2059
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:53,836
It's not just a joke.

2060
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:54,837
It's true.

2061
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:57,840
But the thing is, if you draw what a

2062
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:57,840
monoid is, it's like a thing which like

2063
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:57,840
one of these like you see on that picture

2064
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:57,840
you've got this gauss thing, and then it'

2065
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:57,840
's got a black dot, and you got one wire,

2066
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:57,840
and then it has a black dot, and then two

2067
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:12,849
wires come out of it.

2068
01:34:12,849 --> 01:34:14,851
And I said, this is like copying.

2069
01:34:15,852 --> 01:34:17,854
Well, a monoid is like that in the other

2070
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:18,855
direction.

2071
01:34:18,855 --> 01:34:20,857
Like, you've got two things that go into

2072
01:34:20,857 --> 01:34:22,859
a dot and that come out with one thing.

2073
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:24,861
So when people say monoid, they mean

2074
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
something like they often mean something

2075
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:27,864
like addition.

2076
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:29,866
You've got two numbers that come together

2077
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:31,868
and they produce one number.

2078
01:34:31,868 --> 01:34:32,869
We've got, like, multiplication.

2079
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:35,872
You've got two numbers again that come

2080
01:34:35,872 --> 01:34:37,874
together and produce one number.

2081
01:34:37,874 --> 01:34:39,876
So it's like the opposite of copying in

2082
01:34:39,876 --> 01:34:39,876
some abstract sense, which takes one

2083
01:34:39,876 --> 01:34:43,880
thing and gives you two things.

2084
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,882
This is something that takes two things

2085
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:47,884
and gives you one thing.

2086
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:50,887
And so you can just draw the diagrams

2087
01:34:50,887 --> 01:34:50,887
that define a monoid and say, okay, well,

2088
01:34:50,887 --> 01:34:56,893
what does this mean for endofunctors?

2089
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:58,895
And you can sort of start to reason about

2090
01:34:58,895 --> 01:34:59,896
it a bit more approachably.

2091
01:34:59,896 --> 01:35:01,892
I mean, it's still quite abstract because

2092
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:01,892
it is quite abstract, but it makes it

2093
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:01,892
kind of less scary to use this kind of

2094
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:06,897
language, I think.

2095
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:12,903
Daniel: Awesome.

2096
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:16,907
Yeah, there's so much psychology and

2097
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
sociology in mathematics and just hearing

2098
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
about yeah, on real chalkboards, people

2099
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
branch and they flow and they circle

2100
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
things and they put an X through

2101
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:31,922
something.

2102
01:35:31,922 --> 01:35:33,924
It's like there's all these operations

2103
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:36,927
that can't be copied with a typewriter.

2104
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:40,931
And as our cyberphysical and social

2105
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:40,931
niches develop and we have different

2106
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:40,931
affordances, different metaphors,

2107
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:40,931
different quantum reference frames for

2108
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:40,931
working and being, it starts to make more

2109
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:40,931
sense for having a natural language that

2110
01:35:40,931 --> 01:36:01,946
can express that.

2111
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:06,951
Toby: Then I go on.

2112
01:36:07,951 --> 01:36:08,953
I said loads of stuff.

2113
01:36:09,954 --> 01:36:11,956
Daniel: It just makes me think of a

2114
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
Turing tape where even if there is a

2115
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
linear representation, it can still in

2116
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
some other way characterize like a Lisp

2117
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:11,956
program with nesting or hierarchical

2118
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:22,967
model.

2119
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:23,968
Even though, yes, there's like a

2120
01:36:23,968 --> 01:36:25,970
linearity but also there's a model.

2121
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:27,972
So it's not that we can't represent

2122
01:36:27,972 --> 01:36:27,972
certain things with the bit streams or

2123
01:36:27,972 --> 01:36:30,975
anything like that.

2124
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:33,978
It's just that that may be more like the

2125
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:33,978
assembly language and that when we

2126
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:33,978
actually want to do certain kinds of work,

2127
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:33,978
, we may want to just move lightly and

2128
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:33,978
semantically with a high level way to

2129
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:46,991
think about math.

2130
01:36:48,992 --> 01:36:49,994
Toby: Yeah, totally.

2131
01:36:49,994 --> 01:36:53,998
It's kind of notable to me that recently

2132
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:53,998
I've been giving talks for a while using

2133
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:53,998
a computer, whether or not over zoom, but

2134
01:36:53,998 --> 01:37:04,003
it could be in person.

2135
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:07,006
I have my PowerPoint slides or whatever,

2136
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:07,006
but these days, if I give a talk, I just

2137
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:07,006
use my digital tablet and I do everything,

2138
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:07,006
, like all the slides by hand, and I draw

2139
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:17,016
pictures.

2140
01:37:17,016 --> 01:37:19,018
And it's nice now that we've got

2141
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:19,018
technology that is starting to be a bit

2142
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:25,024
more human in that sense.

2143
01:37:25,024 --> 01:37:26,025
And I think this is like a kind of

2144
01:37:26,025 --> 01:37:26,025
mathematical technology which is like

2145
01:37:26,025 --> 01:37:28,027
that.

2146
01:37:29,028 --> 01:37:31,030
Although I think it's also notable that

2147
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:34,033
it's still, in some sense, quite niche.

2148
01:37:34,033 --> 01:37:36,035
And I think I don't know, but the

2149
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:36,035
impression I've got from talking to

2150
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:36,035
people is that it's still the case that

2151
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:36,035
some mathematicians think of this kind of

2152
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:36,035
like mathematics as diagrams, as somehow

2153
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:36,035
not quite like real mathematics, because

2154
01:37:36,035 --> 01:37:49,048
it's too much like play in some sense.

2155
01:37:50,049 --> 01:37:53,052
But I think that perspective is changing

2156
01:37:53,052 --> 01:37:56,055
and people are taking it seriously.

2157
01:37:56,055 --> 01:37:59,058
I mean, it is real work, and there's a

2158
01:37:59,058 --> 01:37:59,058
lot of hard problems and stuff actually

2159
01:37:59,058 --> 01:38:04,057
gets done.

2160
01:38:04,057 --> 01:38:07,060
But I think to me, it doesn't really

2161
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:07,060
matter what, like, a handful of

2162
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:10,063
mathematicians think.

2163
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:12,065
It's just what's useful to people that

2164
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:13,066
matters.

2165
01:38:15,068 --> 01:38:18,071
And so I hope that these tools continue

2166
01:38:18,071 --> 01:38:18,071
to develop and we can use them in all

2167
01:38:18,071 --> 01:38:23,076
sorts of different domains.

2168
01:38:24,077 --> 01:38:25,078
I don't know.

2169
01:38:29,082 --> 01:38:31,084
It's notable to me as well that human

2170
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:31,084
vision is kind of like two and a bit

2171
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:35,087
dimensional, really.

2172
01:38:35,088 --> 01:38:36,089
It's not really like three dimensional,

2173
01:38:36,089 --> 01:38:36,089
but you've got a bit of three

2174
01:38:36,089 --> 01:38:38,090
dimensionality.

2175
01:38:38,091 --> 01:38:40,093
And I've never really played much with,

2176
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:40,093
like, three dimensional diagrams, but

2177
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:40,093
maybe I will one day have some tools with

2178
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:40,093
my Vision pro or less not pro thing or

2179
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:47,100
whatever.

2180
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,103
It allow me to do things even more

2181
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:50,103
naturally, like actually plug together

2182
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:56,109
some stuff in some abstract space.

2183
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,110
Who knows?

2184
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:58,111
Who knows?

2185
01:38:59,112 --> 01:39:03,110
Daniel: Yeah, the diagram being two

2186
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:04,111
dimensional.

2187
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:08,115
Or planar gives us this kind of classical

2188
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:11,118
screen holographic screen.

2189
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:13,120
That information can be written on that.

2190
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:16,123
Then quantum cognitive agents can unfold

2191
01:39:16,123 --> 01:39:16,123
into the imaginary plane with the WIC

2192
01:39:16,123 --> 01:39:19,126
rotation.

2193
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:22,129
But also the boundary, just like you said

2194
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:22,129
earlier, can come in many shapes, many

2195
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:26,133
dimensionalities.

2196
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:29,136
So we could have a four dimensional

2197
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:29,136
boundary artifact that still becomes

2198
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:34,141
rotated into a higher dimension.

2199
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:38,145
And that's not the framing or the

2200
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:38,145
mathematics that most of us have learned

2201
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:44,151
up to this point.

2202
01:39:45,152 --> 01:39:49,156
There's a really crystallized would be a

2203
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
complementary way to say it, but codified

2204
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
or fossilized sedimentary understanding

2205
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
of math education, its role in broader

2206
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
thinking and what we learn along the way,

2207
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
and the progressions get reified with who

2208
01:39:49,156 --> 01:40:13,174
makes it through the pipeline.

2209
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:16,177
So I think that's, like the unknown

2210
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:20,181
unknowns here, the known unknowns.

2211
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:24,185
We all know that we struggle to

2212
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:24,185
understand this, but then that's the real

2213
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:24,185
jumping off when it's not just us

2214
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:24,185
adapting into a new regime of learning

2215
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:24,185
and doing, but when there's composition

2216
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:47,208
and construction within that regime.

2217
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:53,214
In our last sections here, Dean or Ali,

2218
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,216
another question.

2219
01:40:55,216 --> 01:41:00,215
Or what are you looking to bridge or gap

2220
01:41:00,215 --> 01:41:02,217
into the dot to?

2221
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,223
Okay, Ali, please.

2222
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:13,228
Ali: Well, yeah, actually, I've written

2223
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:13,228
down a number of questions, but they may

2224
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:13,228
be quite specific, and I think they're

2225
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:13,228
perhaps best suited for the two

2226
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:26,241
discussion.

2227
01:41:26,241 --> 01:41:30,245
But I wanted to thank Toby for I mean, I

2228
01:41:30,245 --> 01:41:30,245
literally had goosebumps the entire time.

2229
01:41:30,245 --> 01:41:33,248
.

2230
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:39,254
So it was really fascinating and quite

2231
01:41:39,254 --> 01:41:44,259
enjoyable, and I learned a lot.

2232
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:47,262
And I hope to… I also have some

2233
01:41:47,262 --> 01:41:50,265
additional questions in my mind.

2234
01:41:50,265 --> 01:41:53,268
I hope to get to some of them in the

2235
01:41:53,268 --> 01:41:54,269
second discussion.

2236
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,272
So, yes, thank you again.

2237
01:41:57,272 --> 01:41:59,274
It was really great.

2238
01:42:00,269 --> 01:42:01,270
Toby: Thanks.

2239
01:42:02,271 --> 01:42:05,274
Daniel: Dean, with the penultimate

2240
01:42:05,274 --> 01:42:05,274
thoughts, what do you see us heading

2241
01:42:05,274 --> 01:42:09,278
into?

2242
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:12,281
Dean: Yeah, well, if it's okay, I'd like

2243
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:12,281
just to read a really brief piece of the

2244
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:12,281
paper because I don't want to launch this

2245
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:12,281
on Toby in the dot two, without giving

2246
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:23,292
him a chance to think about this a bit.

2247
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:25,294
Under seven four, you've got fundamental

2248
01:42:25,294 --> 01:42:25,294
theory, and you say future work connected

2249
01:42:25,294 --> 01:42:25,294
to this thesis need not only be in

2250
01:42:25,294 --> 01:42:25,294
applications, a number of purely

2251
01:42:25,294 --> 01:42:25,294
theoretical questions raise themselves

2252
01:42:25,294 --> 01:42:33,302
too.

2253
01:42:33,302 --> 01:42:35,304
And I love seven four one.

2254
01:42:35,304 --> 01:42:39,308
This one paragraph for me, I call it a

2255
01:42:39,308 --> 01:42:39,308
really have to slow down and enjoy the

2256
01:42:39,308 --> 01:42:43,312
moment today.

2257
01:42:43,312 --> 01:42:46,315
Toby, I don't know if you're a distance

2258
01:42:46,315 --> 01:42:46,315
runner, an endurance athlete of some kind,

2259
01:42:46,315 --> 01:42:50,319
, but your stamina has been phenomenal.

2260
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:52,321
But this one paragraph to me would be

2261
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:52,321
like a refreshment station where they

2262
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:52,321
offer you a milkshake and a piece of

2263
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:57,326
battered fish.

2264
01:42:57,326 --> 01:42:59,328
Like, it's yummy.

2265
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,324
But you need to wait.

2266
01:43:02,325 --> 01:43:03,326
You have to pause and kind of go, I don't

2267
01:43:03,326 --> 01:43:05,328
know if I want to do that.

2268
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:07,329
But it really ties in nicely with the

2269
01:43:07,329 --> 01:43:07,329
syntax stuff that Danny was talking about.

2270
01:43:07,329 --> 01:43:09,332
.

2271
01:43:09,332 --> 01:43:11,333
And I have a question at the end of it,

2272
01:43:11,333 --> 01:43:12,335
so I just want to read it, though.

2273
01:43:12,335 --> 01:43:14,337
The mathematics of belief.

2274
01:43:14,337 --> 01:43:17,340
So you basically said belief is

2275
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,341
theoretical.

2276
01:43:18,341 --> 01:43:19,342
That's fantastic.

2277
01:43:20,343 --> 01:43:22,345
Is in large part about replacing definite

2278
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:22,345
points with fuzzier distributions over

2279
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:25,348
them.

2280
01:43:25,348 --> 01:43:27,350
Independent type theory, we replace

2281
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:29,351
points with terms.

2282
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:32,355
Independent terms are exactly points.

2283
01:43:32,355 --> 01:43:34,357
So a type of theory with belief should

2284
01:43:34,357 --> 01:43:36,359
somehow encompass fuzzy terms.

2285
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:38,361
Just as we can replace points with

2286
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:38,361
distributions, we can replace dependent

2287
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:41,364
points with the dependent distributions.

2288
01:43:41,364 --> 01:43:44,367
However, the standard replacement, moving

2289
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:44,367
from a category of functions to a

2290
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:44,367
category of stochastic channels, obscures

2291
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:44,367
some of the universal categorical

2292
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:50,373
structure.

2293
01:43:50,373 --> 01:43:53,376
And underpins the rules of type theory,

2294
01:43:53,376 --> 01:43:53,376
this standard replacement also misses

2295
01:43:53,376 --> 01:43:56,379
something else.

2296
01:43:56,379 --> 01:43:59,382
While it does allow for fuzzy terms, it

2297
01:43:59,382 --> 01:44:01,378
omits a model of fuzzy types.

2298
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,382
We might well want to express beliefs

2299
01:44:05,382 --> 01:44:05,382
about things whose identity we are not

2300
01:44:05,382 --> 01:44:07,384
quite sure.

2301
01:44:07,384 --> 01:44:09,386
And then you say in the next sentence,

2302
01:44:09,386 --> 01:44:09,386
there seems to be a couple of related

2303
01:44:09,386 --> 01:44:13,390
resolutions to this puzzle.

2304
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:16,393
My question for you is this, and it's not

2305
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:19,396
for today, it's maybe for next time.

2306
01:44:21,398 --> 01:44:25,402
It seems to me we have to grapple with

2307
01:44:25,402 --> 01:44:25,402
this idea of making fuzzy clear and

2308
01:44:25,402 --> 01:44:30,407
making fuzzy precise.

2309
01:44:30,407 --> 01:44:33,410
And you started speaking to that.

2310
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:36,413
And my wonder of coming now with a strong,

2311
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
, much stronger active inference set of

2312
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
priors is there has to be something more

2313
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:46,423
to this than just a gradient descent.

2314
01:44:46,423 --> 01:44:50,427
And I think you started to speak to that

2315
01:44:50,427 --> 01:44:51,428
in this section.

2316
01:44:51,428 --> 01:44:55,432
And so I'm kind of curious.

2317
01:44:55,432 --> 01:44:58,435
Do you think that this is a feature, the

2318
01:44:58,435 --> 01:44:58,435
fact that we can do this, we can do fuzzy

2319
01:44:58,435 --> 01:44:58,435
clear and fuzzy precise and not

2320
01:44:58,435 --> 01:44:58,435
necessarily see that as a contradiction,

2321
01:44:58,435 --> 01:44:58,435
but actually the way category theory kind

2322
01:44:58,435 --> 01:45:14,445
of gives us permission to examine that.

2323
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:16,447
So, again, it doesn't have to be answered

2324
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:16,447
today.

2325
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:19,450
And maybe I'm misinterpreting what you

2326
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:19,450
were trying to say there, so I'm open to

2327
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:19,450
being redirected, but I just think that

2328
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:27,458
this opens up a world of possibilities.

2329
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:29,460
And when I first read it.

2330
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:31,462
Toby: I.

2331
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:34,465
Dean: Don'T know what Ally's Goosebumps

2332
01:45:34,465 --> 01:45:34,465
looked like, but I was just like, oh man,

2333
01:45:34,465 --> 01:45:38,469
I really want to ask you about this.

2334
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:45,476
Toby: Yeah, the thing about fuzzy type.

2335
01:45:46,476 --> 01:45:49,480
Yeah, so I do got to start by saying I

2336
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:49,480
agree that what some of this is seeking

2337
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:49,480
is something like thinking clearly about

2338
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:49,480
thinking fuzzily in some way is kind of

2339
01:45:49,480 --> 01:46:01,486
weird.

2340
01:46:02,487 --> 01:46:05,490
It's like having some certainty about

2341
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:07,492
uncertainty.

2342
01:46:08,493 --> 01:46:11,496
But it's definitely the case that still

2343
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:11,496
now I think a notion of fuzzy type theory

2344
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:11,496
is not well developed, though I am aware

2345
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:11,496
of people, various people having thought

2346
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:11,496
about this and people thinking about it

2347
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:26,511
at the moment.

2348
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:30,515
And of course I've got my own ideas about

2349
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:32,517
it, but it seems natural, right?

2350
01:46:32,517 --> 01:46:34,519
Like, we often think we know what a thing

2351
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:34,519
like we can recognize a thing, but maybe

2352
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:34,519
you're not quite sure and so you're not

2353
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:34,519
sure if it's this or that or you see

2354
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:34,519
somebody coming down the street towards

2355
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:34,519
you and you kind of recognize them as

2356
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:49,534
somebody you know or you used to know.

2357
01:46:49,534 --> 01:46:51,536
And then as they approach that, their

2358
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:51,536
identity becomes a bit clearer, but you'

2359
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:51,536
're not, you know, you weren't sure for a

2360
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:56,541
while.

2361
01:46:58,543 --> 01:47:01,540
And I think there's nothing to say that

2362
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
we shouldn't be able to in some sense,

2363
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
like types are a kind of element of some

2364
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
bigger space and so we should be able to

2365
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:14,553
play all this math to it.

2366
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:17,556
And it's kind of really about figuring

2367
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:17,556
out what the rules are that makes the

2368
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:17,556
kind of language of type theory kind of

2369
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:17,556
align nicely with the language of

2370
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:29,568
probability.

2371
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,572
And it's a research effort, but I'm happy

2372
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:35,574
to talk about it more next time.

2373
01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:38,577
I'm also happy to talk in any detail

2374
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:38,577
about any of the actual specifics of the

2375
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:38,577
stuff in the material, in the thesis or

2376
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:38,577
whatever else in category theory you

2377
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:49,588
might be interested in.

2378
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:51,590
I'll probably be expert in everything, of

2379
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,590
course, but I mean, I'm happy to try my

2380
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,590
best, particularly if Ali, it sounded

2381
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,590
like your questions were maybe of a more

2382
01:47:51,590 --> 01:48:01,594
technical nature, maybe not.

2383
01:48:01,594 --> 01:48:02,595
I don't know if I got the right sense of

2384
01:48:02,595 --> 01:48:02,595
what you were saying, but if they are, I'

2385
01:48:02,595 --> 01:48:02,595
'm happy to talk about the details of

2386
01:48:02,595 --> 01:48:06,599
that.

2387
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:07,600
Ali: Thank you.

2388
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,603
Toby: And also to review any of the stuff

2389
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:10,603
to try to say, because you're right that

2390
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:10,603
there's a lot of detail in the thesis

2391
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:10,603
because you make a flame and you're

2392
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:10,603
supposed to substantiate it and that

2393
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:24,617
means you have to give a proof.

2394
01:48:24,617 --> 01:48:26,619
And sometimes the proof is quite

2395
01:48:26,619 --> 01:48:26,619
complicated.

2396
01:48:28,621 --> 01:48:31,624
But structurally, I want this to be

2397
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:31,624
simple, or at least to have a simple

2398
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:36,629
framework.

2399
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:40,633
And so I would like to be able to clarify

2400
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:40,633
some of that if there's time for that, or

2401
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:45,638
if it comes to it.

2402
01:48:45,638 --> 01:48:48,641
Daniel: Yeah, that sounds amazing.

2403
01:48:48,641 --> 01:48:51,644
In two, we will return perhaps any

2404
01:48:51,644 --> 01:48:51,644
questions that people submit as a comment

2405
01:48:51,644 --> 01:48:51,644
on the video or as a message in the

2406
01:48:51,644 --> 01:49:01,648
category theory channel.

2407
01:49:01,648 --> 01:49:04,651
On our discord, we'll curate those

2408
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:04,651
questions, we'll rewatch and digest, and

2409
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:04,651
then we can begin with Ali asking some,

2410
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:04,651
taking us on a little bit of a technical

2411
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:16,663
journey.

2412
01:49:17,664 --> 01:49:20,667
And Toby, thanks again for the incredible

2413
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:20,667
work.

2414
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:25,672
It's defined our 2023 in many ways, so it'

2415
01:49:25,672 --> 01:49:27,674
's been a joy and we.

2416
01:49:27,674 --> 01:49:29,676
Toby: Look forward to next.

2417
01:49:29,676 --> 01:49:31,677
Thanks for plowing through.

2418
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,682
There's also the stuff I think we talked

2419
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:35,682
about before that we haven't really

2420
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:35,682
touched on this time, and obviously I

2421
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:35,682
didn't really touch on much in the thesis

2422
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:35,682
about how do you actually fit in action

2423
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:35,682
into this framework and how do you start

2424
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:49,696
to talk about this multi agent stuff.

2425
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,698
If there's time, we can talk about all of

2426
01:49:51,698 --> 01:49:51,698
that.

2427
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,704
Daniel: Two of the pieces, just to share,

2428
01:49:57,704 --> 01:49:57,704
that gave us some of the most laughs were

2429
01:49:57,704 --> 01:49:57,704
first, we didn't get action and we're

2430
01:49:57,704 --> 01:49:57,704
like, it wasn't an anti climax, it was a

2431
01:49:57,704 --> 01:50:12,713
climax of its own.

2432
01:50:13,714 --> 01:50:15,716
And and then also we had had so many

2433
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
discussions over the months of time and

2434
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
the treatment of time backwards and

2435
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
forwards, ringing the bell, unringing the

2436
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:26,727
bell, all of these different concepts.

2437
01:50:26,727 --> 01:50:30,731
And then in your limitations, you said we

2438
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:30,731
really have to work on getting a

2439
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:36,737
dynamical treatment.

2440
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:38,739
Toby: Oh, yeah.

2441
01:50:38,739 --> 01:50:41,742
But I actually think that depending on

2442
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:41,742
what you care about, it may not be too

2443
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:44,745
hard.

2444
01:50:44,745 --> 01:50:45,746
So that's fine.

2445
01:50:45,746 --> 01:50:48,749
Daniel: But even that you would say it

2446
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:48,749
that way, just having dealt with time and

2447
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:48,749
then to be like, well, I thought that's

2448
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:48,749
what dynamical modeling was, involving

2449
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:59,760
time.

2450
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,755
Toby: No, you're right.

2451
01:51:00,755 --> 01:51:01,756
You're totally right there.

2452
01:51:01,756 --> 01:51:05,759
So all I meant at that point was the kind

2453
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:05,759
of statistical framework that I've been

2454
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:10,765
working with until then.

2455
01:51:10,765 --> 01:51:14,769
It just seems you have a prior and a way

2456
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:14,769
of generating predictions, but there's

2457
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:14,769
nothing to say that the prior has any

2458
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:14,769
data about how stuff actually evolves in

2459
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:14,769
time or the predictions have any data

2460
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:14,769
about how the Sense data evolves in time.

2461
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:32,787
.

2462
01:51:32,787 --> 01:51:34,789
It's just like I believe that there's

2463
01:51:34,789 --> 01:51:34,789
this on the screen and that makes there

2464
01:51:34,789 --> 01:51:34,789
be this stuff coming to my eye and that's

2465
01:51:34,789 --> 01:51:40,795
it.

2466
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:41,796
It's just like a snapshot.

2467
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:44,799
And so when you want to include time

2468
01:51:44,799 --> 01:51:44,799
evolution in those beliefs, things become
