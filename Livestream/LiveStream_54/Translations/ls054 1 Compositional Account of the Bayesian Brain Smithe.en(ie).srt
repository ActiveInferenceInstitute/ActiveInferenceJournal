00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,880
hello and welcome it's June 7th 2023

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,599
we're in active live stream 54.1

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,660
discussing mathematical foundations for

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,580
a compositional account of the Bayesian

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,800
brain so

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,500
welcome to the octave Institute we're a

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,960
participatory online Institute that is

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,760
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,560
applied active inference

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
this is a recorded in an archive live

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,640
stream so please provide feedback so we

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,279
can improve our work

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,260
all backgrounds and perspectives are

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,600
welcome and we'll be following video

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,180
etiquette for live streams

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,980
to learn more about live streams and

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,719
other projects head over to

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,660
activeinference.org

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,680
and

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,539
we're here today in active stream 54.1

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,280
we are

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,260
in our first discussion with the author

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,719
of the work mathematical foundations for

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,420
a compositional account of the Bayesian

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,860
brain

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,860
today in 54.1 we're going to say hello

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,040
then

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,680
be on with it and see where it all goes

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,760
together

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,460
so we'll begin with introductions

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
California

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,280
six months ago was quite unfamiliar with

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,680
category Theory and have had quite a fun

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,040
Journey with Ali and Dean and I guess

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,700
Toby via stigmergic proxy so really

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,920
looking forward to this discussion and

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
all pasta Dean and then Ollie

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,579
thanks Dan I'm Dean I'm here at Calgary

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,560
um

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
my goal in in joining this group was to

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,700
take the idea as we got in the one of

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,079
the previous slides the idea of

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,140
practicing applied active inference I

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,259
see the potential through category

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,240
theory of making that

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,659
even more accessible more possible and

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,880
so I'm really excited to have the author

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,340
with us today and maybe have a look at

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,560
what that means and I'll pass it over to

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,860
Ali

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,720
hello I'm Ali I'm an independent

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,020
researcher Premier run

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,980
um

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,879
and as I said in that zero I'm quite

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,239
excited uh to be here to discuss this

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,660
magnificent dissertation with its offer

58
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,640
and well

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,700
I mean in the past several months we did

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,160
our best to uh understand and dissect it

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
as best as we could but obviously we

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,640
have many many uh questions uh that I'm

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,119
looking forward to uh discuss them with

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,200
so Toby

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,260
thanks again for joining please lead us

66
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,720
off with just any introduction and

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,239
background that's going to set the stage

68
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,500
maybe how the the work came to be and

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,959
that would be great so thanks again yes

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,019
great well thanks Dan and and all of you

71
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,659
guys for hosting me and and I need the

72
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,840
courage to read my thesis which uh as

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,879
you noticed it's a kind of strange mix

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
of things it's kind of both the research

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,280
work and as I noticed

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
um what are you saying in the in the

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,420
previous stream that it's at this kind

78
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,739
of Frontier of knowledge and of course

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,739
it needs to be but I also because this

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,319
language is so kind of unfamiliar to

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,480
people and because I think it you know

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
will prove to be very useful Across The

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
Sciences

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
um I really wanted to make it kind of

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,840
legible to people so you know for people

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,519
to read the the thesis but also like my

87
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,420
research

88
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,760
and kind of understand what I was saying

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,000
effectively how it came about was

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,420
yeah I was supposed to be studying

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,080
um interactions between frontal cortex

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,659
and hippocampal circuits in the brain

93
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,019
and at the sort of time of trying to get

94
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,879
started with that

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,440
um obviously I was kind of interested in

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,418
the free energy principle and active

97
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,120
inference and all of that

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,580
um but I found that there was a lot of

99
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,940
kind of you know as I've said in in the

100
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,740
thesis and as you talked about in the

101
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,320
previous stream and probably in Pre in

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
discussion support as well there's a lot

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
of kind of you know each dip each

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
research group has its own language and

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,479
uh these different groups you know they

106
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,280
don't

107
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,660
necessarily talk to each other in a way

108
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,300
that is kind of an efficient kind of

109
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
communication each you know group of

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
people is interested in their own thing

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,020
and one of the things I like about

112
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,520
um the free energy principle and about

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,380
active inference is that it's this nice

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,120
sort of General framework for adaptive

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,220
systems and so it is in itself a good

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,560
place to kind of situate an

117
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,080
understanding of systems like the brain

118
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
and other adaptive systems

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,060
but of course it it doesn't you know

120
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,180
immediately resolve this problem of well

121
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,040
the problem that was for me a kind of

122
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,080
confusion about like what's going on in

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,699
these circuits and how should I

124
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,560
understand what one person says in

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,780
relationship to what another person says

126
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,759
about you know this bit of the brain or

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,139
this interaction

128
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,520
and so

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,620
in the process of kind of trying to

130
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,919
understand what was going on there and

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
to resolve in part the confusion I had

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,860
about predictive coding itself and the

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,139
complexities of all these models I was

134
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,720
encountering I kind of resolved to

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,460
replace that confusion with another kind

136
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,560
of confusion which is the you know what

137
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,080
is all this crazy category Theory stuff

138
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,699
and you know so you might think okay

139
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,259
well that's mad what's the point of that

140
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,820
you've just made everybody's life a lot

141
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,039
harder it's kind of like that XKCD comic

142
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,419
where you've got all of these different

143
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,520
standards and you know we decided to

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,039
like come together and and make a new

145
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,720
standard and in fact this is happening I

146
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,460
think in like I don't know what it was

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,479
in

148
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,820
in cellular biology maybe I heard John

149
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,100
Baez talking about this yesterday that

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,419
you know they

151
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,759
have lots of different standards for

152
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,759
writing down diagrams but describing

153
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,380
like interacting like biological

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,060
processes and the other kind of

155
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,639
scientific community in in that area has

156
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,880
set up a kind of mediating body to kind

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,220
of try to you know form like bring

158
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,940
together all of these diagram languages

159
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,620
um but they weren't really able to do so

160
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,060
so they still they instead of just

161
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,199
coming up with one new standard they

162
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,639
came up with three new standards to try

163
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,580
to unify these things and the travel you

164
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,220
know I had or have with these different

165
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,919
languages or different sort of syntaxes

166
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,080
for talking about scientific things is

167
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
that

168
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,680
not only are they all different but

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,539
they're kind of all ad-hoc and so the

170
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,280
reason why I feel that there's promise

171
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,699
in replacing this confusion of this of

172
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,180
of so many different ideas I mean of

173
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,680
girls it's great to have this kind of

174
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,840
ecosystem of ideas about how these

175
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,520
complicated systems work

176
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,740
but it's still very ad hoc and confusing

177
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,720
and so instead of just coming up with a

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,580
new ad hoc and confusing way of

179
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,080
understanding

180
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,479
these things I was kind of hoping to use

181
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,780
a language which is maybe kind of

182
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,160
universal in some sense like it's really

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,800
about or it's really capturing like how

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,620
we think and maybe also like how the

185
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,460
world is actually you know built up

186
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,080
um but in particular it seems to capture

187
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,940
something of how we think and so you

188
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,680
know the fundamental theorem of category

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Theory says that you shall know a

190
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,020
concept by the company it keeps to adapt

191
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,380
the kind of that that sort of motto of I

192
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,460
think um birth from Linguistics that you

193
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,960
should know a word by the company it

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
keeps

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,020
um that that's really like at the heart

196
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,780
of how we come to understand things in

197
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,479
the world and I think the math that is

198
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
category Theory captures that very

199
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,780
nicely and very precisely and at the

200
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,220
same time enforces a kind of discipline

201
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,020
and so I know it is quite like hard

202
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,180
going reading this kind of research work

203
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
this kind of introduction to all this

204
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,319
new stuff

205
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,319
but you know in part that's because yeah

206
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,599
yeah when you're being disciplined is

207
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,940
hard and doing things very formally

208
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,639
precisely does require a bit of

209
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,740
well you know a lot of uh dedication

210
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,900
um but that isn't to say that it's not

211
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,899
worth it or that these ideas even used a

212
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,580
bit informally somewhere down the line

213
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,799
might not be useful at least to sort of

214
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,559
frame the way we think about things

215
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,860
um so I hope to be you know some use in

216
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,700
helping not only sort of change the

217
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,220
confusions that we have but also like

218
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,899
modulate them in the kind of way that

219
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,640
will be sort of useful for people

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
awesome great starting place

221
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,860
Ali ordin

222
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,680
where can we um begin how can we replace

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
some of our

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
prior confusions with a new and

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,839
different confusion

226
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,200
all you want to go first yeah can I ask

227
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
a quick question to Toby Toby when you

228
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,580
were talking about when you actually saw

229
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,880
all of these standards so you know you

230
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,380
were the sort of

231
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,519
okay

232
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,860
what you were the

233
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,720
you were the Hub of all of these

234
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,140
standards you saw sort of all around you

235
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,459
can you maybe speak to

236
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,440
the idea of what you perceived or what

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,019
you sensed was the stabilizing function

238
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,959
of those standards but also the

239
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,959
searching function because of course you

240
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,720
had gone out and realized there were all

241
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,980
of these different

242
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,040
standards of play I remember it in a in

243
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,380
a previous professional life of mine

244
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,080
having to have um

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,019
Chief Financial officers and their math

246
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,959
sit at the table with engineers and

247
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,240
their math and them talking right past

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
one another and making no sense to each

249
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,920
other and I had to be kind of the medium

250
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,740
between them so that their math would

251
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,120
actually

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
get a little bit sticky and they'd be

253
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
actually be able to understand and

254
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,440
interpret one another in your in your

255
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,779
experience with this how did that play

256
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,540
out the both the stabilization through

257
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,820
the standards and the search

258
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,580
well I I I guess I should begin by

259
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,820
saying is that I'm um if this is still

260
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,640
this is still like ongoing and nor am I

261
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,899
an expert in all of these different

262
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,100
standards um but the thing that I kind

263
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,959
of at least noticed right that was that

264
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,880
people use languages like you know

265
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
Bayesian inference or reinforcement

266
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
learning or dynamical systems to talk

267
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,060
about certain bits of the brain that I

268
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,260
was interested in

269
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,279
um

270
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,380
and they kind of just plug all these

271
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,600
ideas together and it sometimes and it's

272
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,040
fine so you want to write a paper and

273
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
it's about a particular phenomenon and

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,700
it's great you maybe come up with some

275
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,860
nice model and you you know you put

276
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,680
people in MRI scanners and that the the

277
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,980
quantities and the you know in the sort

278
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,839
of build signal correspond to quantities

279
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,640
in your model and that's that's great it

280
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,019
says that maybe this bit of the brain is

281
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,279
doing that

282
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,140
um I mean we can argue about MRI at some

283
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,240
other time but it doesn't really tell

284
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,700
you about how that little model you've

285
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,980
got interacts with the rest of the brain

286
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,660
or the rest of the world and so if you

287
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,339
care about like this whole complicated

288
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,140
thing you want to know how do these

289
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,899
parts actually talk to each other

290
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,660
um and so I was just fortunate that was

291
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,579
kind of beginning of this

292
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,959
um in some sense to be in the right

293
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,240
place at the right time so I kind of

294
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,980
knew there were these different you know

295
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,500
ingredients all being put into these

296
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,200
different models and you know

297
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,019
only yeah I'm only sort of familiar with

298
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,000
some of them but I could still see that

299
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,380
they had sort of similar structure and

300
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,060
that was in part because I had been

301
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,060
going to you know some applied category

302
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,820
Theory meetings or talks and seen that

303
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,839
say

304
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,860
um

305
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
economic games which are very closely

306
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,899
related to reinforcement learning have

307
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,700
this kind of bi-directional structure

308
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
where an agent tries to sort of

309
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,160
effectively in some sense choose they

310
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,720
make an observation and they sort of do

311
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,800
this kind of

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,079
forward projecting kind of thing and

313
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,899
choosing an action at the same time as

314
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,720
saying okay well if supposing I take

315
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,519
this action like what would the payoff

316
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,800
be and that's this kind of backwards

317
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,019
facing thing and then you can sort of

318
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,639
chain that process and think well if I

319
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,740
do this in multiple stages like how does

320
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,540
the utility I get at the end of this

321
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,899
yeah multi-stage process like feedback

322
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,899
to the utility I'm going to get having

323
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,940
taken just one step right now

324
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,279
and that's kind of that's a similar sort

325
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,079
of bi-directional thing to what happens

326
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,779
in active info or like in well in

327
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,540
predictive coding specifically where uh

328
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,060
like a little circuit is saying okay

329
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,459
well I need given that my like high

330
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,339
level beliefs about what's causing this

331
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,160
like sensory data I need to sort of

332
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,279
retro fits the actual sensory data to

333
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,079
kind of come up with a new belief about

334
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,760
what those causes are

335
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,740
and so that seemed to me to have the

336
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,839
same kind of structure

337
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,720
um a similar thing also happens in um

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,180
backdropping machine learning where you

339
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,120
have say some neural network in it and

340
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,160
it kind of you know you feed forward

341
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,740
some information through the network and

342
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,380
it say does a classification and then

343
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,839
you have some some training system which

344
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,100
says okay well actually you have this

345
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,420
error and then you need to sort of back

346
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,579
propagate that to update you know say

347
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,500
some parts of the model on the basis of

348
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
that and so that also has this kind of

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,339
bi-directional structure

350
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,500
um and it just was fortunate that at

351
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,899
this time people were talking talking a

352
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,399
lot about these kind of bi-directional

353
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
processes and you know so I was thinking

354
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,300
about these things at the same time I

355
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,820
was kind of thinking about you know the

356
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,620
application of Bayesian inference and I

357
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,720
kind of noticed that you know they had

358
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,040
the same structure and I kind of wanted

359
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,920
to figure out what was going on there

360
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,440
like really sort of pinned down

361
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
what what it was that made like this

362
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,920
kind of predictive coding circuit have

363
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
this kind of shape in some sense

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
because as I think you've also talked

365
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
about

366
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,279
um and I've kind of mentioned a few

367
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,740
minutes ago that you know individual

368
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,779
predictive coding circuit isn't an

369
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,880
isolated system right it's part of like

370
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,279
this hierarchical thing and so you have

371
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,019
one little circuit connected to another

372
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,019
circuit and that whole

373
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,899
conglomeration of circuitry is supposed

374
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,240
to do something quite Grand but at the

375
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
same time it's made of smaller parts

376
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,540
um and I think the the main one of the

377
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,100
major confusions I had at the beginning

378
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,100
was okay so you have this like

379
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
big

380
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,279
um generative model with lots and lots

381
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,620
of factors and you go through it and you

382
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,720
try to derive like the differential

383
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
equations

384
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,680
that give you the sort of predictive

385
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,959
coding Dynamics by saying okay well yeah

386
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,160
we're going to minimize the free energy

387
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,660
and you have this complicated thing with

388
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,120
lots of sums in it and it seems like

389
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,399
very intimidating to try to like come up

390
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,500
with that differential equation even

391
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,420
though actually when you sort of look at

392
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,300
this the kind of the look at the process

393
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,579
that you're doing is quite kind of

394
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,019
mechanical because effectively you're

395
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,699
doing the same transformation to each

396
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,500
factor of this model

397
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,139
and so that also hinted that there was

398
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,720
this kind of compositionality thing

399
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,639
going on in these systems okay you not

400
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,260
only do you see that these kind of this

401
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,420
bit of the brain is has this kind of

402
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
modularity but you also get a sense of

403
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,959
that modularity in that derivation

404
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,699
you're doing

405
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,440
um and so what I wanted to do was to

406
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,600
capture both of these things one is the

407
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,399
kind of shape of the circuitry and the

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,680
other is like how

409
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,500
to somehow save the efforts of having to

410
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,120
kind of red arrive everything reach

411
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,380
different case

412
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,779
and that kind of

413
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,699
formalization of this process

414
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,459
corresponds to a kind of functorality

415
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,339
you get when effectively the functional

416
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,800
reality means you preserve compositional

417
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,660
structure and so what you want to do is

418
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,740
you want to say okay well what's the

419
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,560
compositional structure the thing that

420
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,660
the function starts with like the

421
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,060
process starts with and that's the

422
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,920
compositional structure of Bayesian

423
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
inference itself

424
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,740
and then you want to say okay well

425
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,899
what's the compositional structure of

426
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,519
the kind of dynamical systems which is

427
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,899
the thing you're trying to get to and

428
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,579
how do you map from one to the other in

429
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,920
a way that preserves that structure and

430
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,899
so that's kind of what I was doing in

431
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,360
this thesis is just saying okay what are

432
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
the structures I need and how do I

433
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,540
relate them

434
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,759
um and you know it turned out that there

435
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,500
were a lot of details that I had to

436
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
write them all down

437
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
um but the kind of basic idea I hope is

438
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
quite simple it's just trying to say

439
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,660
what are those kind of sim like the kind

440
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,079
of individual components like the kind

441
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,059
of Lego plots and how do they like

442
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,640
connect together

443
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,579
and how can I sort of you know relate

444
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,679
this the kind of Lego blocks of one

445
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,419
thing with the Lego box of another in a

446
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,140
way that's kind of preserves the shapes

447
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,919
um

448
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,919
and so yeah it's it's kind of is kind of

449
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,620
Mammoth thing but the kind of

450
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,780
fundamental idea is quite simple and I

451
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,080
think it's kind of like how when

452
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,700
if you're if you're like programming in

453
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,320
computer you can write in a high level

454
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,700
language or you can write something like

455
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,140
low-level language and if you wanted to

456
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,880
you could write in

457
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,160
Assembly Language

458
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,980
and category theory is like

459
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,799
a language where you start with the kind

460
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,500
of Assembly Language and you build up a

461
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,140
high level language within the language

462
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,000
itself in some sense

463
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,580
and so if you really want to start with

464
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,740
at the very beginning like I did with

465
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,660
the definition of category and then

466
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,640
build up to this big thing you have to

467
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
make a lot of steps because like

468
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,960
Assembly Language is really simple and

469
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
it's you know it's just like single

470
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,620
instructions to your processor does and

471
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,120
so getting all the way to something like

472
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,980
Zoom that can do a video call is quite

473
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,840
complicated and so people don't they

474
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,700
start with a high level language

475
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
but the thing that people strive for in

476
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,679
designing high-level languages is to set

477
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,840
them up in such a way that they're sort

478
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,960
of the the abstractions are quite nice

479
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,880
or sort of modular

480
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,240
and so that's what I'm trying to do with

481
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,460
using category theory is to kind of find

482
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,380
abstractions that are modular in a

483
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,240
similar kind of way and I know

484
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,840
um

485
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
on the previous call

486
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,160
um Dan you mentioned

487
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
um the the kind of analogy between like

488
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,860
typing in this category theoretic sense

489
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,140
and in the programming sense and they're

490
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,880
quite similar

491
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,679
um the category Theory sense is kind of

492
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,760
a much

493
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,700
sort of more General bigger idea it has

494
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,380
a lot it is so in comes there's all

495
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,419
kinds of things

496
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,140
um

497
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,419
but you could imagine somewhere down the

498
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,039
line having a programming language that

499
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,179
you know people are trying to build

500
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,100
these things but having a programming

501
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,000
language where you could express

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,039
anything you could in you know category

503
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,679
Theory and you know I to be honest find

504
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,480
it quite intense

505
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,580
and quite sometimes mechanical and

506
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,919
tedious how to prove that certain

507
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,380
categorical structures satisfies the

508
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,820
coherence conditions that it has to

509
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,220
satisfy like you know lacks

510
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,320
associativity or monoidality or

511
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,340
something like this there are a lot of

512
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,500
like diagrams that you have to check

513
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,600
commute or something and much of the

514
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,100
time that checking is quite tedious and

515
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,220
someday I hope that we all have tools

516
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,260
that we could say okay well I'm going to

517
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,020
spell out what my structure is and the

518
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,580
tool will just check that it satisfies

519
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,740
all the axioms and so you know I know

520
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,360
you guys have to Wade through a lot of

521
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,460
that stuff in the thesis but it's kind

522
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,520
of meant manually necessary right now

523
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
but in the future it might not be and

524
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,460
then we can use this high-level language

525
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,700
in amongst more kind of liberal way I

526
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,960
hope that would be great sorry I've been

527
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,020
woughly overrated so I'll stop there

528
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,580
possum great or go to a question in the

529
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,220

applied category Theory and active

531
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,780
inference have tremendous promise I

532
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,280
confess I have not yet read this

533
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,020
dissertation it would be helpful to

534
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,880
describe a specific engineering

535
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,160
application for the work

536
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,760
so what do you see as approximate and

537
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,820
and or distal engineering applications

538
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,240
here

539
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,860
another thing

540
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,660
that I hope

541
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,960
could be produced soon as an engineering

542
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,900
application is a general

543
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,919
modeling framework for building kind of

544
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,860
complicated active inference systems

545
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,799
that might include lots of Parts lots of

546
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,500
you know agents

547
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,440
um kind of like

548
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
um

549
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
something that

550
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,919
my colleague Jules Hedges wants in

551
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,660
cybernetics more generally something

552
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,720
like a kind of programming language may

553
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
be that incorporates

554
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,679
um

555
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,320
all of these kind of strange cybernetic

556
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,640
structures I mentioned earlier like

557
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,520
reinforcement learning and like back

558
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,380
propping machine learning and Bayesian

559
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,200
inference they all have this kind of

560
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,880
bi-directionality and so you should be

561
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,860
able to have this kind of modeling

562
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,120
environment which allows you to

563
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,980
incorporate all of these things in a

564
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,620
kind of nice way

565
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,400
um

566
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
but I think before we get something

567
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,360
quite as Grand as a whole new sort of

568
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,460
modeling environment I think just having

569
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,919
tools to help us build

570
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,600
um you know approximate an active

571
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,340
inference systems that are really nicely

572
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,980
compositional is is one thing that I you

573
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,380
know hope to come out of this

574
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,600
uh to be honest I don't know very well

575
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,659
what the general tooling is like for

576
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,760
this kind of thing right now I know that

577
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,640
there's SPM I know that there's like Pi

578
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,880
mdp for certain kinds of problem

579
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,500
um but I don't know how sort of General

580
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,360
they are

581
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,539
um another thing that you would get if

582
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,659
you have this kind of toolkit because of

583
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,940
the kind of modularity of category

584
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,740
theory is you you should be able to plug

585
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,260
it into other things that exist already

586
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,059
so

587
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,380
um one of the things that's particularly

588
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,059
of interest to me at the moment is kind

589
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,580
of multi-agent systems

590
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,260
um and sort of building trying to

591
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,179
understand how we could build

592
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,919
um

593
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
something like or simulate things like

594
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,559
you know something like a corporation or

595
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,320
some kind of yeah some kind of society

596
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,940
structure where you've got lots of

597
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,159
active inference agents coming together

598
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,780
to pursue a sort of common shared goal

599
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,059
um how can you kind of

600
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,640
effectively distribute that goal sharing

601
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
across systems they could be like little

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
robotic systems say or something like

603
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,200
that or you know agent or like I I don't

604
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
know because precisely I'm kind of like

605
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,539
an abstract thinker but I yeah I I think

606
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,179
like being able to kind of

607
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,539
control or like

608
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,580
modulate the performance of these kind

609
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,400
of

610
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,720
distribute to melt the agent like active

611
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
infant systems might be quite a cool

612
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,280
thing yeah to be able to build

613
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,500
so that that's kind of like

614
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,240
I kind of maybe

615
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,799
sort of

616
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,600
flavor the kind of thing that this

617
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,460
tooling gives you

618
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,280
um I suppose for me this particular work

619
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,559
was really about

620
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,520
trying to encourage people to use this

621
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,280
language to understand things more

622
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,780
clearly

623
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,740
um

624
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,720
so

625
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,000
yeah there's a lot of stuff that I hope

626
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,860
we can understand well at least I can

627
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,419
understand more clearly

628
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,320
um

629
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,740
sure

630
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,059
awesome thank you ollie

631
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,140
thank you uh yes so in this paper by uh

632
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,539
Christoph walterwitz

633
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,460
um are there category theoretical

634
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,100
explanations of physical phenomena

635
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,840
he argues that category Theory by itself

636
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,780
does not and cannot provide any

637
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,600
mathematical explanations for a physical

638
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
phenomena so the idea here is that

639
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,580
category theory is merely a meta Theory

640
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,320
to kind of

641
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,039
uh to a kind of bookkeeping or

642
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,620
householding of the physical theories

643
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,100
and it's not a tool to construct the

644
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,960
mathematical theory of physical

645
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,100
phenomena itself uh I'm not sure I agree

646
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,179
with this argument entirely because

647
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,520
um in one sense some of the most

648
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,460
profound aha moments in the history of

649
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,640
science obviously results from looking

650
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,559
at

651
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,500
a pre-existing Theory or a model from a

652
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
novel angle and I believe category

653
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,380
Theory can provide such a novel

654
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,980
perspectives even when looking at some

655
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,100
established and pre-existing models or

656
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,659
theories so

657
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,600
what do you uh I'm curious to know uh

658
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
your opinion about this so do you think

659
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,500
uh category Theory can actually provide

660
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,799
uh mathematical explanations for uh I

661
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,059
mean either in cognitive science

662
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,960
Neuroscience or even other areas uh

663
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,500
other scientific disciplines as well

664
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,740
I think it's a it's a subtle question

665
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,919
um right now it's probably largely the

666
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,440
case that the role of category theory is

667
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,900
kind of this I'm not I think it's like

668
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,480
like bookkeeping but like clarification

669
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,220
too

670
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,299
um

671
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,640
bookkeeping if you think of it as a very

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
general way of like trying to account

673
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,059
for the

674
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,860
the things you're thinking about very

675
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,100
precisely and not sort of Miss details

676
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,260
like if you your books don't balance you

677
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,900
can't miss some payment or some debt

678
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,480
um I think that's quite a nice analogy

679
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,440
but I think one of the goals of quite a

680
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,779
lot of people or not maybe I mean the

681
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,080
fair chunk of the community

682
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,059
um particularly that which comes from a

683
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,700
sort of more abstract mathematical side

684
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,260
of

685
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,960
um category Theory

686
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,799
one of their goals is to try to recast

687
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,360
a lot of how we think in kind of purely

688
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
categorical language so one of the

689
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,000
things that category Theory allows us to

690
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,539
do is to kind of

691
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,320
formalize

692
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,140
in some sense patterns that crop up all

693
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,419
over the place using the notion of

694
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,520
universal Construction

695
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,900
and

696
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,059
the thing about Universal constructions

697
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,940
is that you have like

698
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,340
some little pattern and if you know that

699
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,380
you can

700
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,640
instantiate that pattern in your

701
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
category

702
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,940
that you have like some object which

703
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,200
kind of

704
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,900
captures the essence of that pattern and

705
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,120
you don't need to say

706
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,940
be able to kind of write down all of the

707
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,880
specifics of that object you know sort

708
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,100
of a priori because the kind of

709
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,440
universality gives you a recipe for

710
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,840
constructing it it gives you it in in

711
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,059
some sort of unique way and so you know

712
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,159
that if you have this universality you

713
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,380
can always you can always like access

714
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,659
this object and yeah so I'm talking very

715
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,720
generally but because of that

716
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,960
um one thing that people try to do is to

717
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,940
try to say okay well what it you know

718
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,679
we've got these things that we're

719
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,179
interested in

720
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,580
um in say physics like you know the

721
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,400
principle of least action or like the

722
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,140
nature of

723
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,240
um

724
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,640
space time or something like that

725
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,500
can we express those things as kind of

726
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,200
universal constructions

727
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,799
um

728
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,179
all

729
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,279
princes in a completely different realm

730
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,799
like we may have some process which is

731
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,539
something that we're interested in on

732
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,340
the computer like

733
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,559
um the migration of data and databases

734
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,520
can we write that down in a way that

735
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,559
doesn't have any kind of ad hoc

736
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,039
ingredients it only is built from

737
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,200
Universal constructions these are things

738
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,020
that we can just write down kind of

739
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,480
abstract sort of axioms in the language

740
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,700
of category Theory and that kind of

741
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,840
gives us

742
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,360
the the process or the structure that we

743
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,279
that we want

744
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,500
um this kind of line of work is

745
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,320
often called like synthetic

746
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,659
something like synthetic

747
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,720
um you know

748
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,880
probability Theory or synthetic

749
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,640
um physics or synthetic topology or

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,500
something like that and it means you

751
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,659
sort of start from these kinds of very

752
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,140
high level categorical ideas

753
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,240
and then you sort of end up with a

754
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,799
characterization of the essence of the

755
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,840
thing you're interested in in physics I

756
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,860
kind of

757
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,960
um a simple example of this

758
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,740
um which I Supply in a kind of

759
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,779
relatively feeble effort to say that

760
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,299
it's not true that category Theory

761
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,100
doesn't give you a characterization of

762
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,539
things in

763
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,740
um physics

764
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,580
so there is a category of say

765
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,580
topological spaces and the morphisms

766
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,240
between them are continuous functions

767
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,480
and there's amorphism a category rather

768
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,659
of sets and the morphism between the

769
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,399
sets are functions

770
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,500
and of course underlying every

771
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,899
continuous function is a plane function

772
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:28,020
and so there is a functor from the

773
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,539
category of topological spaces to the

774
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,880
category of sets which just forgets

775
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
the the topological structure of the

776
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,380
spaces because every topological space

777
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,779
has an underlying set of points

778
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,059
so you have this forgetful punter

779
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,100
and this forgetful Factor has two

780
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,320
adjoints and one of the things the

781
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,740
category Theory teaches you is that

782
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,080
adjunctions give you this universality

783
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,860
so adjoint functors are characterized

784
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,919
uniquely by their kind of the

785
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,520
satisfaction of this adjunction property

786
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,620
so these two adjoints to this forgetful

787
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,279
functor one gives you what are called

788
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,880
um discrete spaces so if you take a set

789
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,980
you can turn it into a topological Space

790
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,320
by thinking of all the points as little

791
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,179
Islands in this space so there's no like

792
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,460
connectivity between them

793
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,260
and that's called a kind of discrete

794
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,480
space on that set

795
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,419
and the other adjoint functor

796
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,880
gives you what's called the Indiscreet

797
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,120
or sometimes co-discrete space where all

798
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,679
of the points are sort of collected into

799
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,299
one big like Island so you they're also

800
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,679
connected together so it's like a sort

801
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,260
of fully connected graph

802
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,000
and of course that's very different from

803
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,679
the discrete space and it's different

804
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,960
from like the space time or the space

805
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,520
that you live in

806
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,919
um which has a particular kind of you

807
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,480
know connectivity like you can't walk

808
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
through walls

809
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,700
um and so you know people try to use

810
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,740
these things particularly use Junctions

811
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,539
to characterize things like Properties

812
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,120
or spaces another thing that comes out

813
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,279
to a jointness

814
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,200
um and this is something that like

815
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,320
um can let you read about uh later

816
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,880
because it'll take me the rest to talk

817
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,740
to try to explain

818
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,980
um but the you might be familiar from

819
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,840
logic that you have these quantifiers

820
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,179
you have existential and Universal

821
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,399
quantifiers

822
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,659
um and you can do things with these

823
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,640
quantifiers like you can say

824
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,020
um you can sort of compose them together

825
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,539
so you get things like for all X there

826
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,200
exists a y such that this

827
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,020
and you can think sometimes of these

828
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,520
Composites or these compositions of

829
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,399
quantifiers as like maybe like modal

830
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
operators like you can sort of decompose

831
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,220
necessity and possibility in terms of

832
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,460
the compositions of of logical

833
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,140
quantifiers

834
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,059
but the kind of weird thing about

835
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,880
bondifiers is that they too arise out of

836
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,679
an adjunction

837
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,260
um it's kind of like they are left and

838
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,380
right adjoints to substitution so if you

839
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,520
have a proposition you can like

840
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,380
substitute the term intimate

841
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,419
and the the adjunction the adjoint

842
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,220
punctures to substitution give you the

843
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,559
quantifiers and you can sort of take

844
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,179
this another step and then you can think

845
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,460
about like composing these adjoint

846
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,039
functors and those give you the modal

847
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,840
operators

848
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,580
and so that's something that comes just

849
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,320
out of category Theory but it's really

850
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,960
sort of fundamental in in sort of logic

851
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
and you know we might forget them as a

852
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
kind of close relationship between

853
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
physics and computation or physics and

854
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,159
logic

855
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,200
um or you know physics and information

856
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,179
and information and computation and

857
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,059
logic so I think it's not quite true

858
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,299
that there's nothing to be gained from

859
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,700
um thinking about

860
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,880
hello traditional mathematical things

861
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,580
uh or traditional physical things using

862
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,279
category theory in some sense they you

863
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,200
know doing that really clarifies the

864
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,980
essence of them

865
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,580
um because it tells you what they're

866
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,320
kind of universal properties are and you

867
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,659
can then like instantiate those things

868
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,179
in different contexts so one of the

869
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,679
things that you could do is start to

870
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,199
think about

871
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,639
these kind of logical structures in

872
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,139
different contexts and that's kind of

873
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,760
like what type theory is all about and

874
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,320
you could use it to think about the

875
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,199
logic of like dynamical systems or you

876
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,960
could use it to try to characterize

877
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,060
um say like the Universal Property even

878
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,040
of the free energy principle and that's

879
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,060
something that I like to think about

880
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,960
sometimes like how can we think about

881
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,460
active inference systems as like trying

882
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,440
to achieve their goals

883
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,719
is that is that related to these

884
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,418
Junctions that you know come up in sort

885
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,820
of foundations of logic when you look at

886
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,679
them categorically and if it is then

887
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,418
that's quite profound because it tells

888
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,699
you that you know maybe the fep does

889
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,379
have this kind of universality that

890
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,260
people want to claim it does

891
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,720
um so I think you know it it is true

892
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,760
that right now because it's quite early

893
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,500
days

894
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,940
um

895
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,640
category theory is kind of mostly used

896
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,480
for bookkeeping but I guess that might

897
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
be because

898
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,780
um there's quite a lot of bookkeeping to

899
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,020
do before we can make the most of this

900
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,700
kind of move

901
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,220
uh make the most of using these kind of

902
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,619
universal structures and maybe one day

903
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,780
further in the future where people are

904
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,220
more familiar with this kind of language

905
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,560
and we have this you know big library of

906
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,900
categorical tools and yeah our computer

907
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,520
program our computer computer sort of

908
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
modeling environments and programming

909
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
languages know how to like import stuff

910
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,060
from this category just really easily

911
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,800
and so you don't have to do all this

912
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,440
kind of tedious manual stuff maybe like

913
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,260
in the future in that future it'll be

914
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,020
much more common just to say okay well

915
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,000
we're going to start to model things

916
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
using these Universal properties you

917
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,020
know off the bat rather than trying to

918
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,040
sort of retrofit them

919
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,578
awesome thank you Toby Ollie

920
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,780
uh yes thank you so much for your

921
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,140
detailed answer and uh again I have a

922
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,500
follow-up question to that so there's

923
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,240
this view in philosophy of science that

924
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,940
views scientific theories

925
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,859
um as not as a kind of Monolithic uh I

926
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,099
mean phenomena or model but rather any

927
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,619
given scientific theory can be viewed as

928
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,440
a population of models so some of those

929
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,500
models are more fundamental than the

930
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,619
others and um

931
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:46,440
or in terms of manual the Land There are

932
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,460
virtual and actual part of each of Any

933
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Given scientific model so the idea here

934
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,820
is that uh the actual part of scientific

935
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,380
models uh try to capture the context

936
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,980
dependent uh behavior of phenomena or

937
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,079
any physical system but on the other

938
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,780
hand the virtual or more fundamental

939
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,660
part of scientific models or theories

940
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,599
try to somehow capture it's more

941
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,920
abstract and

942
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:23,099
abstract model of the phenomena in terms

943
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:27,599
of its topological invariance so do you

944
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,780
think the category Theory can provide a

945
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,980
rigorous language to somehow unify this

946
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,880
view of science I mean and to see how

947
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,359
exactly those context dependent part of

948
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,940
scientific theories fits or at least can

949
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,440
be compatible with the context

950
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,960
independent part of scientific theories

951
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,920
or the virtual part uh because you see

952
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,820
uh in the context dependent uh or actual

953
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,800
models uh scientists usually try to

954
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,800
refine their models to fit the data as

955
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,420
close as possible or at least

956
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,380
approximately close enough to be useful

957
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,099
but for the more fundamental Parts uh

958
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,740
comprising of principles axioms and so

959
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,640
on they only try to capture the

960
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,060
topological

961
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,180
terrain or or the uh I mean the

962
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,599
topological invariance of the models and

963
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,099
how models can be compared in terms of

964
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,119
their uh singularities and

965
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,540
topological shapes

966
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,339
yeah that does sound very familiar I

967
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:54,180
don't know this kind of work or idea

968
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,579
um in any you know I I haven't come

969
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,200
across this before but it does sound

970
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,599
something that's quite amenable and in

971
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,640
fact you know there seems to be at least

972
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,339
in my mind some alignment between this

973
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,079
kind of sense of virtual that you're

974
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,880
talking about and this kind of

975
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,119
universality that I was talking about

976
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,579
um so you could think of you know a

977
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,040
category of models of particular kinds

978
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
as being like inhabited by all of those

979
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,320
things which satisfy these invariants

980
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,420
and then you have different you know

981
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,180
individual instances of these things

982
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,220
um which would be like the objects of

983
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,540
the category and then the the

984
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,300
differences between them other you know

985
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,160
the morphisms and the thing about

986
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,500
morphism in the category is that often

987
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
they are the things which preserve the

988
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,540
structure uh in other bits of

989
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,640
mathematics they're called homomorphisms

990
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,680
and that's where the word morphism comes

991
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,339
from

992
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:50,400
and so you could think of those as you

993
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,300
know

994
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,700
ways of comparing the models or

995
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,500
translating the models from one to the

996
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,940
other

997
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,339
um but preserving those invariants yeah

998
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,099
and so that that seems to me to capture

999
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,820
some of the idea that you were sketching

1000
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,220
um I guess

1001
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,320
one thing which may or may not be useful

1002
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,300
depending on how you look at it

1003
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,400
um the category Theory gives you is it's

1004
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,460
obviously kind of a lot more General and

1005
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,720
so it allows you to talk about

1006
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,859
invariance of kinds that you know more

1007
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,420
than just

1008
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,619
um

1009
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,839
yeah excuse me um more than just

1010
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,640
topological

1011
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,060
um in some sets like functorality is a

1012
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,440
kind of

1013
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,020
um in like it kind of captures the kind

1014
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,579
of invariance as well as saying okay

1015
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,579
well we preserve this structure

1016
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,200
um

1017
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,839
each I mean one just one way of like

1018
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,000
looking at a topological spaces to take

1019
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
its

1020
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,579
um

1021
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,859
it's what's called it's nerve and so

1022
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:56,280
that that takes a topological space

1023
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,500
and turns it into

1024
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,480
a category

1025
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,359
and you could sort of think of the the

1026
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,640
morphisms in that category as like the

1027
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,220
the sort of like the paths in that space

1028
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,040
or ways to sort of get from one sort of

1029
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,280
part of the space to another

1030
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,740
um and then you know morphisms

1031
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,040
functors between topological spaces

1032
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,099
considered in categories like that

1033
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,960
they really are just things that

1034
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,440
preserve those topological structures

1035
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,780
um and so so like this this language

1036
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,660
kind of seems to Encompass the kinds of

1037
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,460
things you're saying um

1038
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,359
yeah yeah it would be nice yeah I would

1039
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,160
I would love somebody to you know make

1040
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,140
that connection

1041
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,020
oh oh just follow up on this and then

1042
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,599
Dean it's a it's a um related comment

1043
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,900
from Roman in the chat Roman wrote uh

1044
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,780
quoted you in this fractal

1045
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,599
quote streaming thinking about the fep

1046
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,520
through category theory in relation to

1047
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,339
goals maybe allows to prove that fep has

1048
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,200
the universality that people claim it

1049
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,460
has

1050
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,880
and Roman asks didn't Maxwell ramstead

1051
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,700
and Dalton's octave devel already kind

1052
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,980
of proved this in the Bayesian mechanics

1053
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,859
physics of and by belief work

1054
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,839
so you're talking about the role of

1055
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,359
generalization

1056
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,740
what do we gain with the category

1057
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,240
theorification of fep beyond for example

1058
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,880
the generalizations that we've seen in

1059
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,339
Bayesian mechanics and G Theory over the

1060
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,759
last year

1061
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,619
yeah that's a

1062
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,119
it's a question

1063
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,920
um I think

1064
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,880
Maxwell and Dalton are doing a great job

1065
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,619
um

1066
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,720
formalizing the ideas of Bayesian

1067
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,300
mechanics but I as far as

1068
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,319
I'm aware the job isn't done yet

1069
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,260
um and so

1070
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,880
I

1071
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,859
haven't yet seen

1072
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,540
yeah I mean I have a particular

1073
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,180
aesthetic right and I would like

1074
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,460
I would like to see a really clear

1075
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,500
recipe of a way to take of like on the

1076
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,800
one hand some like or like some machine

1077
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,960
that takes in that has like a particular

1078
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,359
shape but it's like input shape and it

1079
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,680
takes in

1080
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
um like a dynamical system of a

1081
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,839
particular kind and it gives me back

1082
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:33,900
um like uh the the specification of an

1083
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,880
inference problem so that that amical

1084
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,220
system is solving

1085
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,740
um I think that's what Daisy mechanics

1086
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,280
is saying it's saying okay well if we

1087
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,960
have a dynamical system that is somehow

1088
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,420
kind of you could sort of

1089
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,819
look at it and say it has a boundary

1090
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,940
it's a Markov blanket

1091
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,180
um that you can write down its Dynamics

1092
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,579
as if it were

1093
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,160
doing free energy minimization that is

1094
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,720
solving some inference problem

1095
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,040
um

1096
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,260
but there's a lot of and I so I think

1097
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,700
that statement is true for certain

1098
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,920
classes of dynamical systems but it's

1099
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,980
not I don't think

1100
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,680
the story has been made

1101
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,780
like like the questions for me are like

1102
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,180
what are the classes

1103
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,040
um and what are their what's the essence

1104
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,160
of those dynamical systems so

1105
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,520
if the result might depend on like

1106
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,220
specific technical criteria which maybe

1107
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,319
you think okay well like that that's

1108
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,180
kind of like a distraction from this

1109
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,200
kind of

1110
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,180
abstract principle which we're trying to

1111
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,319
get at

1112
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,119
and so it would be nice to sort of know

1113
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,240
what the actual like Essence is of the

1114
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,099
problem that allows us to do this

1115
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,780
translation

1116
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,579
and then you know that there seems to be

1117
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,680
to be like questions of

1118
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,300
I mean other fairly technical questions

1119
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,400
but questions about things like well

1120
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,280
what is this boundary thing like how

1121
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
long does it persist and what does it

1122
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,180
mean to separate the thing off and

1123
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,119
consider it as having a boundary

1124
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,060
um most of the treatments I've seen of

1125
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,760
this idea have not been done I've not

1126
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,700
been explained or expressed in uh in

1127
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,040
this compositional way and so they just

1128
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,980
assume you're given a system and a

1129
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,000
boundary and then that's kind of it

1130
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,660
um

1131
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,220
but

1132
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,440
you know boundaries come in all kinds of

1133
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,880
shapes

1134
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,640
um like the boundaries of the cells in

1135
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,140
my body are kind of all like glued

1136
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,240
together in a particular way and they

1137
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,780
form me and I also have a boundary

1138
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,480
um and so how

1139
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,420
do the kind of local inference problems

1140
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,280
that are being solved by those

1141
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,260
individual cells

1142
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,400
given their gluing amount to the kind of

1143
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,020
inference problem that my whole body is

1144
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,180
solving

1145
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,339
um and I don't think an answer to that

1146
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:07,800
has you know is anywhere near given

1147
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,940
right now

1148
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,140
um and yet

1149
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,780
obviously we're you know we look at

1150
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,760
systems out in the world and they all

1151
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,359
seem to display this property of

1152
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,859
re-energy minimization or at least

1153
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,740
something that looks a lot like it

1154
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,260
and so it would be nice to be able to

1155
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,200
relate those

1156
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,780
um those kind of inference problems to

1157
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,160
one another

1158
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,420
um

1159
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,339
so I think there's still a lot to be

1160
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,420
done

1161
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,579
um just just because we've kind of made

1162
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,800
some First Steps doesn't mean that we're

1163
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,540
all of the way there

1164
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,260
um

1165
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,000
but obviously

1166
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,040
given my Aesthetics what I would love to

1167
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,079
see is this kind of abstract

1168
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,859
characterization of this universality

1169
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,900
um and I think I yeah I think there's a

1170
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,420
way of stating well at least the

1171
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,960
structure of that Universal Property

1172
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,599
um using this compositional act of

1173
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,300
inference language of which the thesis

1174
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,000
is apart but effectively it seems to be

1175
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,520
something like this adjoint thing that I

1176
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,020
was talking about earlier so you on the

1177
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,180
one hand you have a like a something

1178
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,079
like a functor that takes

1179
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,960
um statistical problems and gives you

1180
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,180
dynamical systems

1181
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,280
that kind of solve those inference

1182
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,260
problems

1183
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,240
and so that's a function from like you

1184
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,859
know statistical yeah what I call

1185
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,260
statistical gains into dynamical systems

1186
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,359
of some kind but of course you have lots

1187
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,099
of dynamical systems and say you know

1188
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,440
what this

1189
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,000
um Bayesian mechanics idea seems to be

1190
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,319
saying is that you can go the other way

1191
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,180
as well

1192
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,240
and maybe this mapping in the other

1193
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,460
direction is also puncturial and that

1194
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,099
would be a way of characterizing this

1195
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,560
kind of gluing together of dynamical

1196
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,040
systems like I was talking about cells

1197
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,599
and

1198
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,000
ending up with maybe dynamical

1199
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,280
statistical games that also have this

1200
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,460
kind of gluing property

1201
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,819
um but there's still a fair amount of

1202
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,800
work to be done

1203
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,859
even to get like the basic framework to

1204
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:20,400
spell out that story precisely

1205
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,500
um you know it's work that I'm trying to

1206
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,839
slowly get on with at the moment

1207
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:25,800
um

1208
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,040
but I think you know some you know the

1209
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,339
ingredients to to doing this

1210
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,160
in the kind of generality that I would

1211
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,640
like that's starting to become clear

1212
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,099
um and so hopefully we get there but I

1213
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,839
don't think it's I don't think it's sold

1214
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,560
yet

1215
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,800
awesome yes just so cool to see all

1216
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,839
these

1217
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:52,440
paths

1218
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,359
weaving together

1219
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,078
Dean

1220
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,940
I I think it's awesome Toby that you in

1221
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,000
this conversation have kind of

1222
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,800
anti-captorated jointness and calm and

1223
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,839
jointness because I think that's a huge

1224
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,540
part of your work here and

1225
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,940
and reading it so here's my here's my

1226
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,500
question I

1227
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,980
I think and I would like you to maybe

1228
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,240
comment on this as though you were

1229
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,060
explaining it to a very curious 15 year

1230
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,900
old

1231
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,380
so on the sort of most basic level when

1232
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,300
I hear under sort of a common

1233
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,339
adjointness principle the word

1234
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,680
bookkeeping I immediately Wonder okay so

1235
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,560
what is the partner what's the what's

1236
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,099
the thing that's being glued to

1237
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:43,619
to use your metaphor and so

1238
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,520
I would glue it to taking receipts

1239
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,180
essentially where you have a

1240
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,220
stabilization of a record under

1241
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,540
bookkeeping

1242
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,240
so I get that part and then the taking

1243
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,180
receipts is the

1244
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,980
stabilization of the change function

1245
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,200
right the The Exchange

1246
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,599
something that we receive those two

1247
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,240
things seem to try to work together

1248
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,460
which then allows for compositionality

1249
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,400
and all that other stuff but maybe I

1250
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,220
wonder if maybe you could kind of speak

1251
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,099
to this idea that something is presented

1252
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,540
to us

1253
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,640
and then what the category Theory does

1254
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,240
is allows us to now start working with

1255
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,480
so where does this fit does this fit

1256
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,619
under

1257
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,800
this superordinate of being a tool or

1258
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,400
does it fit under this column directly

1259
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,460
adjacent as a as a rule like that's the

1260
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,599
part where

1261
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,240
I think the adjointness could be really

1262
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,300
really helpful in terms of maybe helping

1263
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,160
people

1264
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,619
see the applicability and not just the

1265
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,900
abstraction what's what's your thoughts

1266
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,040
on that

1267
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,900
so I mean I I yeah so I think um

1268
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,540
David Spivak talks about category Theory

1269
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,480
as being light a kind of accounting

1270
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,339
system

1271
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,180
um

1272
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,740
or accounting systems plural for

1273
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,540
mathematics and I I think he's kind of

1274
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,480
quite right then so the way I the way I

1275
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,700
see it is like

1276
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,260
um

1277
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,900
when you you know when you're keeping

1278
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,160
books

1279
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,599
um particularly if you're sort of using

1280
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,599
like this double entry system you're

1281
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,839
trying to keep track of the stuff that

1282
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,260
kind of flows into and out of your

1283
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,780
account uh your company or whatever it

1284
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,520
is

1285
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,280
um without sort of missing some bits you

1286
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,500
see where everything goes

1287
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,220
and so that's how I think of this kind

1288
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,200
of mathematical language

1289
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,200
you have this stuff

1290
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,280
um

1291
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,640
and it's kind of like some like abstract

1292
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,680
collection of things some like maybe

1293
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,260
mathematical ideas

1294
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,119
and

1295
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,720
well a functor takes that stuff and does

1296
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,819
something with it and turns it into some

1297
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,220
stuff of another kind

1298
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,079
um but

1299
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,240
yeah it's like this kind of Double Entry

1300
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,980
idea but you know when you take

1301
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,300
something out of here you have to put it

1302
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,900
in here and so you have to sort of keep

1303
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,640
track of all the details at least all of

1304
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,440
the details that are relevant

1305
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,059
to those two

1306
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,240
to that float I suppose

1307
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,319
and so when you have an adjunction you

1308
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,260
have a way of going from one place to

1309
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,440
another and Back Again

1310
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,000
without losing trackers and stuff

1311
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,800
um it's like a little bit kind of like

1312
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,480
you're allowed to lose track of some

1313
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,000
stuff but you you know the stuff you've

1314
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,280
lost track of because you don't care

1315
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,880
about it like you know it like you know

1316
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,020
you might you might allow for

1317
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,220
um

1318
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,619
you know have some like butter there but

1319
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:08,819
you know how big your buffer is

1320
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,800
something like that

1321
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
so like a little bit like more precisely

1322
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,119
like in a junction it's a way to map

1323
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,099
from one category to another and and

1324
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,660
Back Again

1325
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,119
in such a way that like the

1326
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,559
the two mappings are kind of like

1327
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,319
like ideal approximations of the inverse

1328
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,900
of some of each other

1329
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,240
and that you can sort of measure the

1330
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,780
difference between between them

1331
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,119
um they sort of like give you it gives

1332
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,640
you like an isomorphism of between the

1333
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,220
two sets of morphisms of some kind and

1334
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,140
that that kind of gives you this nice

1335
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,079
kind of structure preservation property

1336
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,960
this kind of bookkeeping property

1337
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,980
um

1338
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,780
I don't I mean so I know that there

1339
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,460
there are people out there

1340
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,420
um

1341
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,680
who have used

1342
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,359
um

1343
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,380
category Theory to

1344
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,819
[Music]

1345
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:09,480
um model stock flow diagrams

1346
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,800
and so these are used in economics to

1347
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,380
measure you know stop flows of stocks

1348
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,880
and things like that but they also use

1349
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,579
an epidemiology to model you know the

1350
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,020
transmission of disease because that's

1351
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,339
also like

1352
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,859
um a flow of some stock you have people

1353
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,900
moving around

1354
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,040
um

1355
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,440
and so I you know it would be nice to

1356
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,540
sort of bring this idea full circle and

1357
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,059
have this mathematical language of

1358
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:37,440
bookkeeping actually applied to

1359
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,180
bookkeeping

1360
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,099
um but I don't I I haven't I don't know

1361
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:44,099
how that would go just yet but but like

1362
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,839
you know if we think of if we think of

1363
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,400
economies and corporations as as

1364
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,960
adaptive systems

1365
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,099
or if we somehow kind of translate from

1366
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:57,780
blows of money to like flows of

1367
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,400
information but there does seem to be

1368
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,200
like an analogy

1369
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,680
between that kind of flow and the kind

1370
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,960
of flows that we think of in active

1371
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,420
inference explicitly

1372
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,660
um and you know another thing yeah one

1373
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,859
of the things I liked about category

1374
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,660
theory is it allows us to make these

1375
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,520
analogies in a precise way and so maybe

1376
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,780
we can

1377
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,579
you know relate these two things quite

1378
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,680
clearly I mean I you know it's yet to be

1379
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,319
done but I would love to see it

1380
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,060
awesome

1381
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,859
[Music]

1382
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:32,220
Dean smiles when his keywords are buzzed

1383
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,160
during a response

1384
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,940
we'll go to another great question in

1385
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,380
the chat from Matt n Matt wrote can you

1386
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,200
provide some ideas about the next

1387
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,599
necessary steps or milestones for

1388
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,000
categorical Theory to be effectively

1389
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,980
utilized across research and in

1390
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,920
subsequent engineering applications and

1391
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,920
I'll just kind of append to that what do

1392
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,339
you think at the individual team and

1393
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,740
organizational scale

1394
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,940
what can we do what Milestones exist to

1395
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,800
realize some of these engineering

1396
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,720
applications and implications that you

1397
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,000
brought up

1398
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,619
right so I think the main thing

1399
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:20,880
possibly unfortunately for you guys who

1400
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,619
spent a lot of time reading the details

1401
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,920
that I wrote is that kind of have this

1402
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,540
community

1403
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,380
um

1404
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,619
develop to a stage where the tools that

1405
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:35,059
I mentioned that allow us to kind of use

1406
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:38,760
these category theoretic Concepts

1407
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,819
fluently without having to know all of

1408
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,559
those like boring and complicated

1409
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:44,819
details

1410
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,040
to develop those to a stage where people

1411
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,140
are actually you know able to use them

1412
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,420
without being kind of like

1413
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,800
mathematicians or category Theory domain

1414
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,020
experts

1415
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,260
um so this is I think starting to happen

1416
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,119
I guess yeah

1417
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,800
as a result of

1418
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,680
the kind of needs of the pandemic

1419
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,380
people have developed these tools for

1420
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,660
epidemiology I mentioned this stock flow

1421
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,559
stuff

1422
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,559
and I think you know you can probably

1423
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,180
there's like some I can't remember what

1424
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,920
it's called unfortunately now

1425
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,760
um

1426
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,559
so in the Julia programming language

1427
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:21,599
there's this great framework for use for

1428
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,040
kind of building

1429
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,140
system using

1430
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,960
category Theory Concepts

1431
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,880
um but of course this doesn't satisfy

1432
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,140
the property of not having to be a

1433
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,480
category Theory domain expert yeah on

1434
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,520
top of that people have built using

1435
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,700
compositional ideas about Dynamics

1436
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,220
Frameworks for you know Building

1437
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,800
compositional dynamical Systems and like

1438
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,720
compositional models for things like

1439
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,660
epidemiology and and stuff like that

1440
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,280
and you know hopefully you will get

1441
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,839
there also with

1442
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,240
um you know statistical modeling and

1443
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,660
active inference and all that stuff but

1444
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,220
what you know once once you've got that

1445
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,960
kind of lower level Library people can

1446
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,940
start to build like user interfaces on

1447
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,740
top of it and that's the thing that's

1448
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,380
starting to happen now with the stock

1449
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,819
flow stuff

1450
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,680
um and I think the people involved in

1451
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,559
that project are

1452
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,140
I mean they know that there's like one

1453
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,700
kind of heat like major like proprietary

1454
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,160
tool for doing this kind of modeling

1455
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,559
which is used for you know it's used by

1456
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,300
lots of different organizations for

1457
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,859
instance it was used by governments for

1458
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,780
modeling during the pandemic but it's

1459
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,819
not like it's not very collaborative

1460
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,000
it's it's not compositional so if you

1461
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,859
like have this huge model it's very hard

1462
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:40,260
to like deal with like to modulate just

1463
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,119
some small part of it

1464
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,700
and so these people are as I say it's

1465
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,720
very unfortunate I can't remember all

1466
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,520
their names um or the name of the

1467
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,020
software but they're building this tool

1468
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,619
which allows you to

1469
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,780
build up these models just using this

1470
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,579
interface but it's built out of this

1471
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:58,559
compositional stuff

1472
00:58:58,559 --> 00:58:59,760
um and so it has a lot of the nice

1473
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,440
properties that come out of it and of

1474
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,299
course you if you if you want you can

1475
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:05,640
sort of delve onto the hood and

1476
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,440
understand like actually how it works

1477
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,599
and connect it to all this other stuff

1478
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,640
and maybe down the line when we've got

1479
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,319
really Advanced tools that that will

1480
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,359
kind of be able to be done for free and

1481
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,420
some nice user interface but I think you

1482
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,859
know so if if people want to make the

1483
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,020
most of this you know they can sort of

1484
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,540
get involved with that kind of effort or

1485
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,880
at least they could sort of get familiar

1486
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,500
with

1487
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,339
the kind of basic ideas of you know

1488
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,740
categorical modeling or compositional

1489
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,920
thinking as I like to say these days

1490
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,240
um

1491
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,099
but I don't I also don't want to like

1492
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,540
prescribe to people that they have to

1493
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,700
know what like a monad is and all that

1494
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,579
stuff because you know there are it is

1495
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,619
technical it has to be technical because

1496
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:55,920
it's about technical stuff but I mean

1497
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,680
it's also trying to be ergonomic and

1498
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,559
yeah if if that's your thing you can try

1499
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:05,299
to help make it more so

1500
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,119
awesome

1501
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,880
Dean

1502
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,839
no I I I I I'm waiting because there's a

1503
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,940
there's a part of the paper that

1504
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,160
the belief updating and the fuzzy of

1505
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,500
distributions and stuff I'm gonna I'm

1506
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,240
gonna wanna talk about that later but

1507
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,979
I'm I'm done for now

1508
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,119
all right I'll go to a question

1509
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,480
submitted by Jr also who created the

1510
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,119
syllabus so thanks again Jr for that

1511
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,299
amazing work so Jr wrote

1512
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:41,099
um in compositional active inference

1513
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:45,359
from May 17 2021 Toby said I'm with

1514
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,880
Valeria on this I think we need to seek

1515
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,680
AI alignment for the artificial

1516
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,359
intelligences that we already have

1517
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,799
things like corporations and social

1518
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,079
systems and we should be concentrating

1519
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:56,880
on those right now

1520
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,339
could you speak more about how you

1521
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:02,220
envision this kind of application this

1522
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,319
is especially interesting in light of

1523
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,299
what we spoke about

1524
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:10,200
in the 54.0 regarding Sensor Fusion and

1525
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,480
consensus what might this mean for

1526
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,059
corporations and social systems

1527
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,000
Toby do you mean that uh this between

1528
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,799
humans and things kind of like

1529
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,319
artificial intelligences or machines and

1530
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,599
artificial intelligences in the context

1531
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,980
of companies and societies

1532
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,260
yeah that's a great question and I think

1533
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,079
you know Jay has done a great job with

1534
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,540
the syllabus which I also had a look at

1535
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,220
um yeah yeah I think

1536
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,020
it's a good it's a good it's a good like

1537
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,460
list of

1538
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,059
um material and Concepts to sort of get

1539
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:49,440
get to grips with

1540
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,960
um but as the yeah AI alignment it's a

1541
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,720
very fixed issue of course

1542
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,040
um I know

1543
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,200
I mean I've put this to people who are

1544
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,540
involved in the

1545
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,119
um AI safety community

1546
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:09,059
and some of them say oh well

1547
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,780
we concentrate on machine intelligent

1548
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,839
rather than corporations because there's

1549
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,180
like no hope for making corporations

1550
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,640
safe like it's too late they're already

1551
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,619
out there so we can't

1552
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:25,140
fix that which is obviously a very sort

1553
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,540
of defeatist attitude but maybe it's

1554
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,040
right

1555
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,260
um to concentrate on a matter where they

1556
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,880
think that they can actually have an

1557
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,299
influence

1558
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,599
um but I do nonetheless still think that

1559
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,940
corporations are like super

1560
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,740
intelligences we they've been

1561
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,339
made out of code but the code isn't

1562
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:52,619
a traditional computer programming

1563
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,559
language it's the legal programming

1564
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:58,380
language that makes up their contracts

1565
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,240
but those contracts sort of determine

1566
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,819
how they operate and are executed on a

1567
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,500
thing which is a bit like a computer and

1568
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,440
like the legal system

1569
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,940
um you know you go into court it

1570
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,700
processes the contract and it explains

1571
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,440
what the outcome is going to be it's a

1572
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,880
you know it's like a computer but it's

1573
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,680
like made up of people

1574
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,480
um and you know they have you know goals

1575
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,260
and yeah desires and they take actions

1576
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,520
and they receive information from the

1577
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,339
world and so yeah they're a lot like

1578
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,339
um well yeah AI systems but it's nice

1579
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:34,680
because we can pun on AI and have it

1580
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,240
mean both artificial intelligence and

1581
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,339
active inference

1582
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:39,599
um

1583
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,599
so yeah so that's like a long Preamble

1584
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:43,200
um

1585
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,020
one of the things that

1586
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,380
at least as far as I know right now the

1587
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,059
active immigrants literature doesn't

1588
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:54,059
talk an awful lot about at least not

1589
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:58,260
very precisely is this notion of sense

1590
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,900
of fusion so you can have like

1591
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,079
two say you have like two yeah so if you

1592
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,400
think about the brain again you've got

1593
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,619
like two like neural little neural

1594
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:09,240
circuits next to each other

1595
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,720
and they're making predictions about

1596
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,420
two visual receptive fields

1597
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,640
but those visual receptive Fields they

1598
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,020
kind of often overlap and so

1599
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,579
what

1600
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,280
we might want a system like the brain to

1601
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,920
do is to be able to kind of glue the two

1602
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,200
inferences that those circuits made

1603
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,040
together over this overlap so that you

1604
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,520
get like this you know unitary deception

1605
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,000
like we don't just see a bunch of

1606
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,160
independent patches of the world we see

1607
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,380
like this kind of glued together thing

1608
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,660
even though it's you know the way it's

1609
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:54,500
been in third is through lots of like

1610
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,260
individual systems next to one another

1611
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,119
and so it's it's

1612
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,520
quite you know on you know it's quite

1613
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,500
clear how to put two things next to each

1614
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,380
other mathematically you just take their

1615
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,540
sort of product

1616
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,400
um that you do then you just do them

1617
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,400
side by side but when you need to when

1618
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,920
you want them to sort of glue together

1619
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,700
in this way

1620
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,540
um you might encounter some problems

1621
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,880
like you might have one make one

1622
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,440
inference and one make another inference

1623
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,619
and say you get like a disagreement

1624
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:30,420
and then you need to start to say okay

1625
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,520
well what's what's going on there like

1626
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,200
what is the nature of this disagreement

1627
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,480
is it saying that can be resolved by

1628
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,020
like say you know passing some messages

1629
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,020
between the two systems or do we need to

1630
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,359
just like ignore some of the data or is

1631
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,000
there fundamentally some like Paradox

1632
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,220
which means that we can't resolve this

1633
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,680
disagreement

1634
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,780
excuse me um and so in mathematics

1635
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,440
there's a lot of theory that's been done

1636
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,339
about precisely this question

1637
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:06,119
in apology in a kind of abstract way

1638
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:08,940
um related to the field of what's called

1639
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,740
cohomology which is all about like

1640
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,859
measuring like obstructions to doing

1641
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:15,900
this kind of gluing thing

1642
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,000
and sort of in this world of like

1643
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,299
applied topology people talk about

1644
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:22,160
um

1645
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,740
algorithms for resolving disagreements

1646
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,260
and and things like that and they often

1647
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,059
have the flavor of like diffusion you

1648
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,799
can sort of think of diffusion as like

1649
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:34,140
smoothing out disagreements like because

1650
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,819
you're just sort of like letting stuff

1651
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:37,980
propagate

1652
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,119
um

1653
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,039
something there maybe could be said

1654
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,680
about like how these diffusion models

1655
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,599
work in generative AI but I haven't

1656
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,900
really thought about that

1657
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,140
um and so you know maybe maybe there's

1658
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,720
something to be done for you know

1659
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,059
political systems or corporations like

1660
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,180
maybe we can look at how

1661
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,579
you know the mathematics says we can

1662
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:05,339
resolve these disagreements and

1663
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:07,140
Implement better processes in our

1664
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,460
organizations that are inspired by those

1665
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,480
algorithms or Universal properties

1666
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,160
and you know maybe that'll make the

1667
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,319
world a kind of more harmonious place or

1668
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,359
maybe it will just help us build

1669
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:21,960
um

1670
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,059
you know systems

1671
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,760
in the future which resolve

1672
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,319
disagreements better and this is one of

1673
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,480
the reasons why I was

1674
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,260
um

1675
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,720
talking about you know multi-agent

1676
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,480
systems before

1677
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,160
um I know

1678
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,020
this is the thing that sometimes people

1679
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,180
think about in the context of you know

1680
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,099
blockchain systems and things like that

1681
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,720
which are actually actively composed of

1682
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,160
lots of different participants

1683
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,799
um but I don't know yet

1684
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,119
how it

1685
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,220
yeah my

1686
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,020
all pan out I mean ultimately you know

1687
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,180
the question of alignment is really

1688
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,619
about do the goals of this other system

1689
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:10,380
um disagree with my goals and you know

1690
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,200
if the other system has more power than

1691
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,420
you then ultimately there's probably not

1692
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,120
much you can do about it regardless of

1693
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,580
whether there's

1694
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,859
oh that where there exists some

1695
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,660
algorithm that might help you smooth it

1696
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,679
out

1697
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:26,339
um

1698
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:29,580
so I I think

1699
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,359
I I hope at least that by looking at how

1700
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,819
like the mathematics says we can

1701
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,880
optimally resolve disagreements or

1702
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,920
smooth them out or patch things together

1703
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,679
or build kind of multi-agent systems

1704
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,420
that will help us build things in the

1705
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,819
future in such a way that we don't get

1706
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:51,540
to a situation where the systems we're

1707
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,120
working with are actually aligned

1708
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,460
against us say

1709
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,719
um but obviously we can't really

1710
01:08:57,719 --> 01:08:59,160
guarantee it we actually have to sort of

1711
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,259
do some work but it's nice that at least

1712
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,060
um the framework of active inference

1713
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,339
allows us to talk about that at least

1714
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,679
right so you know we can say like oh I

1715
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,439
have these beliefs about the world and

1716
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,580
there's other agent that has these

1717
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,279
beliefs about the world and

1718
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,520
then you know we can express these

1719
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,140
beliefs in a mathematical framework

1720
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,299
which is amenable to using these tools

1721
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,000
from cohomology

1722
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,819
and applied topology to be able to start

1723
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,339
to make use of that work that's already

1724
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,140
being done

1725
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,020
um it's to me not so clear how you would

1726
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,198
do that if you're not working in this

1727
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:42,120
active inference world and you're

1728
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,100
working say with just reinforcement

1729
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,479
learning

1730
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:46,799
um

1731
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,279
I I know

1732
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,040
there are similar questions about how to

1733
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,040
kind of glue together preference

1734
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,440
functions in economics

1735
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,360
um and I think

1736
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,120
for me the simplest way to kind of

1737
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,880
understand those questions is to kind of

1738
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,620
turn those preference functions into

1739
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,960
distributions Over States and then use

1740
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,640
this kind of

1741
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,440
um sort of more active inferency

1742
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,080
language to think about it

1743
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,480
um so yeah again we don't you know we're

1744
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,219
just at the start of this process but

1745
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:23,219
like it sounds like we should be able to

1746
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,600
you know make use of this wealth of

1747
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,620
tooling which has been developed in

1748
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,880
other fields

1749
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,640
um because we're putting this into

1750
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,800
this kind of modular categorical

1751
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,960
language we should be able to kind of

1752
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,719
you know put these two modules together

1753
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,280
and make make the most of them

1754
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,000
thanks

1755
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,100
I'm gonna go to a different sort of

1756
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,540
question here

1757
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,000
I'm going to uh play dissertation

1758
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,159
roulette but I kind of know where I'm

1759
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:54,120
going to go

1760
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,199
and uh I'm gonna skip to a diagram

1761
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,860
it's a diagram at the end of chapter six

1762
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,380
and it looks like this

1763
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,060
so

1764
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,000
what do we see here

1765
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,320
what

1766
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,880
happens

1767
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,540
in this graphical arrangement

1768
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,280
it doesn't have to be ultra specific

1769
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,739
about defining every variable but

1770
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:22,080
does right what is what matters here

1771
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,340
that's apology or the geometry is it an

1772
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,020
arbitrary visual layout but you're

1773
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,340
conveying something about the

1774
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,620
connectivity or is it read from left to

1775
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,300
right or is there a certain way to

1776
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,860
understand or just approach these

1777
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,040
diagrams which in slightly smaller forms

1778
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,780
or larger forms we see peppered

1779
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,940
throughout category Theory and your

1780
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,020
dissertation

1781
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:47,159
so okay yeah so here what I'm trying to

1782
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:48,120
do

1783
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,580
is say that

1784
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,840
if you have

1785
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,460
a

1786
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,040
like hierarchical predictive coding

1787
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,239
system

1788
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,900
if you if you take like the form of two

1789
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,580
parts that are sort of plugged into one

1790
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,900
another and this is the the G and the h

1791
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,800
if you like do predictive coding on

1792
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,719
G

1793
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:20,580
and you sort of plug that into h

1794
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:23,280
and then you do predictive coding on H

1795
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,080
with that input

1796
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,960
it's the same thing as doing

1797
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,260
predictive coding directly on the two

1798
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,699
parts

1799
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:35,820
as if they were one thing at the start

1800
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,640
so what I mean is if you have so like

1801
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,900
here we've got

1802
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,960
like a hierarchical system

1803
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,900
again the parts of the hierarchy are G

1804
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,460
and H

1805
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:50,219
and we could do two things we could

1806
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:51,300
either

1807
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,840
apply predictive coding to the two parts

1808
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,940
and then glue those predictive coding

1809
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,500
systems together

1810
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,600
or we could glue like

1811
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,120
the G and H together

1812
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,880
and then apply predictive coding

1813
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,659
to GH the glued system

1814
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,820
and what this bit of this result is

1815
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,520
saying is if you do those two processes

1816
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,100
you get the same dynamical system and

1817
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,659
that's that's saying that this

1818
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:21,179
predictive coding thing

1819
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,280
um at least with this sort of laplacian

1820
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,179
scheme is functorial

1821
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:30,060
so in this diagram

1822
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,100
um it is red

1823
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,920
from left to right I mean of some sense

1824
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,659
you know you can Orient these diagrams

1825
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,040
to have you once as long as you're clear

1826
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,640
about how you how the information flows

1827
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,620
um and if I remember rightly what would

1828
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,480
what we've got is we've got

1829
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,239
some like

1830
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,380
um

1831
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:56,360
a yes we've got X and Y so I think um

1832
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,199
so we've got one system which is

1833
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,300
predicting X and one system which is

1834
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,760
predicting Y and I'm not totally sure

1835
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,620
what p and Q are but I guess they relate

1836
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,340
to X and Y

1837
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,900
um and you've got some stuff that's

1838
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,400
coming into

1839
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,480
the predictive coding system h of G

1840
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,940
and some other stuff which is coming in

1841
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:24,540
and going to H of H

1842
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,760
and these give you like updated States

1843
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,219
so in predictive coding with this

1844
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:31,140
LaPlace algorithm what happens is that

1845
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,239
you you know you get this new

1846
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,580
observation that comes in and you look

1847
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,140
at the error

1848
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,640
on

1849
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,280
you know your you know between that

1850
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,380
observation and your prediction and you

1851
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,900
update your prediction according to the

1852
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,580
sort of direction that error points you

1853
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,960
in

1854
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,000
and so that's what these HG and H

1855
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,460
systems are doing

1856
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,260
but because it's a hierarchical system

1857
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,460
this like second layer

1858
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,560
which

1859
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,860
yeah the second layer requires you to

1860
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,020
take in the prediction of the first

1861
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,159
layer

1862
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,560
so if you sort of follow in the flow of

1863
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,860
information

1864
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,719
h h

1865
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:19,739
akes in inputs from gamma

1866
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:23,100
gamma is the kind of

1867
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,219
um the predictive channel the predictive

1868
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:29,580
part of G

1869
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,199
and so that feeds into h

1870
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,540
and the update

1871
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,300
of G which is a sort of layer above age

1872
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,239
requires the the sort of newly updated

1873
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,540
belief from H right so that's going sort

1874
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,760
of up in the causal hierarchy

1875
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,980
and so if you sort of follow the flow in

1876
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:00,780
as well into this G update function at

1877
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,659
the top h of G

1878
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,540
you see that it gets an input from the

1879
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,179
sigma function

1880
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:11,219
and that's the

1881
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:16,320
that's the new belief emitted by the H

1882
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,900
system in in this part of the proof at

1883
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,420
least that was the notation I used

1884
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:25,620
and so this is a saying if you do

1885
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,840
predictive Cody on these two bits it it

1886
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,120
has this structure which is you know you

1887
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,120
do the forwards pass down through the

1888
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,360
system G and then h

1889
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,400
and that gives you a prediction at the

1890
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,960
kind of lowest level

1891
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,900
and then you you take your observation

1892
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,560
which is I think the thing you get in

1893
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,620
here in Z yeah that's what Z is it goes

1894
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,800
into H you get an updated belief that

1895
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,820
comes out in the form of the sigma

1896
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,000
and then gets passed to the first level

1897
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,400
of the hierarchy

1898
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,460
which is used to give you the highest

1899
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,120
level belief

1900
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,280
great well it's awesome because in so

1901
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,020
many papers

1902
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,360
we see what I guess people expect and

1903
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,760
prefer which is you should be able to

1904
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,800
make a nested model here and have

1905
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,199
communicating agents here and do

1906
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,540
sophisticated affective inference in

1907
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,520
this way and it's like we're already

1908
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,820
playing with the Legos in a sense and

1909
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,400
talking about it like it's a total Play

1910
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,179
Shop so to understand

1911
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:41,760
in a way that is worthy of dissertation

1912
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,800
research

1913
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,920
some of that substrate it's basic Lego

1914
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,719
research and how do you know when you're

1915
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:55,020
working you describe this as a result

1916
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,060
how do we know I mean can I just draw a

1917
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,060
line from here to here or can I just uh

1918
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,820
make a d and just have D you know

1919
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:07,380
connect to gamma what rules do you keep

1920
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,920
a guidebook or recipe on the table what

1921
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,820
rules help us know what

1922
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,760
edges and shapes you can even draw and

1923
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,400
when you describe the manual checking

1924
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,480
are you looking for what

1925
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,480
right so yeah this is this is a good

1926
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,620
question

1927
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,080
um so yeah this is like it is like a

1928
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,620
language so it has a syntax

1929
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,780
um and

1930
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:39,719
that syntax is like I mean it's like the

1931
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,460
grammar right and it tells you what

1932
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,719
things

1933
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,520
make sense to say

1934
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,879
um

1935
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,600
and so you only say those things

1936
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,239
don't we all don't we all no but that

1937
01:18:57,239 --> 01:18:59,460
but it's it's that's what I am laughing

1938
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,219
because often you want to like play with

1939
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:03,600
the grammar right

1940
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,460
and so sometimes you're like oh well you

1941
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,320
know I'm it feels like I'm not allowed

1942
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,140
to like draw this thing like I'm not

1943
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:12,239
allowed to connect this box to this

1944
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,980
other box in this way but like I really

1945
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,480
want to do that

1946
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,699
and it's actually that's not a bad thing

1947
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:19,920
you shouldn't do it in that diagram

1948
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,840
where it doesn't make sense but you

1949
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,460
should take that feed again and reflect

1950
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,659
on it and say

1951
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,520
oh but that's saying that maybe this

1952
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,159
language this diagram syntax is missing

1953
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,860
something important

1954
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,540
and then you should yeah trust your

1955
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,820
intuitions there and say okay well like

1956
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,000
actually what do I need to do to this

1957
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,860
diagram language

1958
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,320
to make it like

1959
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,260
allow me to do that move that I wanted

1960
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,260
to do to draw that thing I wanted to

1961
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,940
draw

1962
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,340
and so that that you know suggests that

1963
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,480
there's like you know you're you're

1964
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,699
walking down you're walking through like

1965
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,620
a valley and you can see there's a hill

1966
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,360
over here there's something peeking out

1967
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,980
over it and you're like actually there's

1968
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,420
nothing over there I need to be able to

1969
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,880
see and so you have to like move over

1970
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,880
towards a different place to be able to

1971
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,480
get to that to that place

1972
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,760
um and so you should do that right then

1973
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,120
that's fine but the reason why I said at

1974
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,040
the beginning don't just draw it in your

1975
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,600
diagram is because then that means your

1976
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,340
diagram doesn't mean anything and that's

1977
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,800
that's worse so it this is part of the

1978
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,739
reason that it's actually requires

1979
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:31,199
using this kind of mathematical

1980
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,420
formalism really using mathematics

1981
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,780
generally requires this discipline

1982
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,520
um because you don't you don't want to

1983
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,620
say things that don't make sense it's

1984
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,020
kind of a if you have an intuition you

1985
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,000
should do it justice and

1986
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,540
and and like treat it seriously and you

1987
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,760
know you probably get more out of it by

1988
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,159
figuring out what's missing

1989
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:55,500
so like you know with this particular

1990
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,900
kind of string diagram language you kind

1991
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,520
of just get used to reading them right

1992
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,920
so I you know that these little black

1993
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,440
dots mean copy some information so you

1994
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,540
if you see the first one or like or like

1995
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,820
the second one on why you know you go

1996
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,860
from why you go into this copier and you

1997
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,840
just send the information

1998
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,659
to both of those outputs

1999
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:17,400
if you read like

2000
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,739
um Bob hooker's work or say his book on

2001
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,060
um

2002
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,520
his book picturing Quantum processes

2003
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,920
which is all about uh quantum theory

2004
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,480
using this string diagram language

2005
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,500
um

2006
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,600
there's a lot of like there are lots

2007
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,000
lots of different rules for like

2008
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,440
stuff you can do with these languages

2009
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,380
languages like you have colored like

2010
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,480
spiders he calls them which are like

2011
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,480
colored versions of these black dots

2012
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,640
and you know you there are things you're

2013
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,219
allowed to do like if you have two

2014
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:55,140
spiders next to each other that are the

2015
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,719
same color you can sort of merge them to

2016
01:21:57,719 --> 01:22:00,120
be a spider with like as many legs as

2017
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,620
the two of them

2018
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,179
and if they don't have the same color

2019
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:05,460
then you can sort of split them apart

2020
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,500
and like that's that those kinds of

2021
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,140
those kinds of moves

2022
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,940
are like

2023
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,760
you know part of the syntax of this

2024
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,199
language but it's a it's a human

2025
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:18,060
language and so people

2026
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,880
developed it and they realized that they

2027
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,199
could do some things and they realize

2028
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:24,060
that they couldn't do others and they

2029
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,300
tried to make the rules of the game you

2030
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,400
know match the things they wanted to do

2031
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,960
and you know they ended up with this

2032
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,140
language which is now used a lot in

2033
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,300
um Quantum Computing because it's a very

2034
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,679
sort of

2035
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,900
like natural language for that problem

2036
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,920
um

2037
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,480
so

2038
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:49,320
as to like how do you know what kinds of

2039
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:52,260
things to draw well here like I was

2040
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:56,100
trying to prove punctuality which is the

2041
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,380
sort of general property

2042
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,320
and it says the thing you know says in

2043
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,000
an abstract way the thing that I started

2044
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,239
by saying which is like there I was I

2045
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:12,060
wanted like h of GH to be the same as

2046
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,880
eight yeah see here if you see this line

2047
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,040
the update map the composite system you

2048
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,199
see I've got

2049
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,800
um HH after HG well I want that to be

2050
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,280
the same as H just applied to H after G

2051
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,140
and so that

2052
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,239
that says okay well I want these two

2053
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,460
things to be equal and so what I do is I

2054
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:36,000
like draw the two diagrams for the two

2055
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,199
parts

2056
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,239
and they okay you draw them out and they

2057
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:40,739
first of all they don't look equally

2058
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:42,360
like oh that's annoying but then you

2059
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,179
stare at it for a bit and you reflect on

2060
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,159
the kind of moves that you're allowed to

2061
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:48,360
make

2062
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,840
you think well okay maybe I can

2063
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,560
um

2064
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,659
maybe I can apply this move and it makes

2065
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:56,400
the diagrams look a bit more similar and

2066
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,199
eventually you make the diagrams look

2067
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,440
the same you've only used rules that

2068
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,420
you're allowed to use

2069
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:06,000
um okay I can see so skimming through to

2070
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,460
see if it looks like that uh directly in

2071
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,100
the thesis but like it effectively

2072
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,199
that's what's going on

2073
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,659
um it's just the rules are a little bit

2074
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:18,120
abstract though that being said

2075
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,560
I know that um

2076
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,080
sobojinski who's uh researcher in

2077
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,340
category Theory at Allen he's got a

2078
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,239
project

2079
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,840
um with a colleague of his to build a a

2080
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,460
mobile game

2081
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,400
which is all about making string

2082
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,360
diagrams equal in this way

2083
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,640
um and so the idea is that in this game

2084
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,400
you have like pictures like this and

2085
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,980
you've got certain moves you can do to

2086
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,299
manipulate the pictures

2087
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,640
and that you know and the sort of aim of

2088
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:00,000
the game is to like transform one the

2089
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,340
sort of starting picture into like the

2090
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,920
sort of gold picture just by applying

2091
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,679
these moves and as you go through the

2092
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,900
game the kind of moves you can do become

2093
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,940
more complicated

2094
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,159
um but it's I mean it's the same kind of

2095
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,920
process I'm not sure the game is at the

2096
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,020
stage now where you're allowed to like

2097
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,659
do this like human creative thing and

2098
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:24,120
think actually I want to like

2099
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,580
make that be a new kind of move or

2100
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,520
change the diagrams or like add in a

2101
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,219
color here or something like that's a

2102
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:34,500
really human thing and you know

2103
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,239
designed to say you shouldn't do that

2104
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,159
but I'm just trying to advocate for do

2105
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,719
that in a way which is also rigorous

2106
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,659
awesome awesome

2107
01:25:45,659 --> 01:25:47,340
yes

2108
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,940
to speak fluently the syntax and the

2109
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,900
grammar

2110
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,880
whether we're talking about natural

2111
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,159
human language or we're talking about

2112
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,679
the active inference ontology

2113
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:01,080
we want the syntax

2114
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:05,580
to be unobtrusive if not compressient so

2115
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,800
that we can actually convey the

2116
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,920
semantics because that's the real

2117
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,199
information flow

2118
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,980
the syntax is within the Shannon signal

2119
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,600
entropy space

2120
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,960
and then in live stream 17 and 4D and

2121
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,580
the physics as information processing

2122
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,500
with Chris Fields where we've been

2123
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,199
exploring these semantic Bayesian

2124
01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:30,420
information flows

2125
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,239
that must out of necessity to be

2126
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:35,820
enriched beyond the syntax have to

2127
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:40,460
include an individual or shared context

2128
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,719
that flow necessitates the proper syntax

2129
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:47,219
and so

2130
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:49,139
it's just um

2131
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:51,239
part of the learning and so it's

2132
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,480
exciting to see that there's games and

2133
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,780
work like yours and others to help

2134
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,179
because

2135
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,639
um if we could

2136
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,159
play with those Legos

2137
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:08,820
and get the instantaneous feedback just

2138
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,340
like learning with a language tutor of

2139
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,080
like no these two pieces they don't fit

2140
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,580
together

2141
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:17,699
and then it just it we kind of um would

2142
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,560
actively infer

2143
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,199
patterns make our own rules and

2144
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:23,940
understandings

2145
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,460
but there would be certain

2146
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,560
compositionality of the system itself

2147
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,360
and so it's interesting to think of like

2148
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,340
you described it as a natural language

2149
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:35,060
it is Technical and naturally arising

2150
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,699
and our natural language without going

2151
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:40,500
too much into the superior Wharf and

2152
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,780
everything like that it reflects the

2153
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:46,440
kind of subject object verb structure

2154
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:50,040
that we often want to convey

2155
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,880
this is a natural language for science

2156
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,000
it conveys what we want to convey

2157
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,480
and so being able to do that in a way

2158
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,900
that is both disciplined and rigorous

2159
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:08,639
also enabling low cognitive overhead

2160
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,060
fluency for some individuals today but

2161
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:15,500
for more tomorrow that's just extremely

2162
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,179
powerful and the fact that it has like

2163
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:22,380
such a beautiful and intuitive way to

2164
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,540
graphically represent it

2165
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:28,560
is um very promising because that may

2166
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,840
tap us into a more holistic

2167
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,260
understanding and a visual field uh or a

2168
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,900
felt sense understanding that just

2169
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,600
looking at this and someone says wait

2170
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,280
this is what we learn in active

2171
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,080
inference it's like well no that's not

2172
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,179
even the tip of the iceberg there's so

2173
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:46,860
much more to it and it's not only this

2174
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,620
and all of that but it's one of the

2175
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:52,980
pieces that at this moment in time

2176
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,880
in our sort of early calculator phase

2177
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,420
or Abacus phase almost it's one of those

2178
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,659
things that that we're tackling but it's

2179
01:29:03,659 --> 01:29:07,500
the wave that we're writing and I just

2180
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,420
can't wait until there's more

2181
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:12,000
accessibility in the learning Pathways

2182
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,940
to to end up the playgrounds to use all

2183
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,460
this yeah I mean I I totally agree with

2184
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,460
with all of that and I I think um it was

2185
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,340
it was nice to see the Jr in this

2186
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,380
syllabus that included

2187
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,719
um references to Eugenia Chang's work

2188
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:30,600
because she's done a lot of great work

2189
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,320
to kind of make mathematics more

2190
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,480
accessible in this way

2191
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,880
um she had another article in the

2192
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,639
guardian like in the last week or so

2193
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,800
even talking about mathematics education

2194
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,219
and how it's often

2195
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:50,219
like it often like scares people because

2196
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:53,100
that ports are like you just apply

2197
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,380
algorithms in this kind of blind way to

2198
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,020
do like multiplication or calculus or

2199
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,600
whatever and and not really like play

2200
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,120
with the concepts in the way that I

2201
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,500
assigned to say okay well you know

2202
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,300
you're drawing these diagrams and you

2203
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,520
know you want to like play with them

2204
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,199
and

2205
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:11,460
it's

2206
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,860
it it would be nice to see mathematics

2207
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,380
education take this kind of more playful

2208
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:19,080
root to start with one of the things

2209
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,440
that um Eugenia says in this article is

2210
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,520
that unfortunately that would make

2211
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,360
things kind of slower because like

2212
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,460
you just want people to you know muck

2213
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,920
around you don't want people just to you

2214
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,960
know be able to churn out this kind of

2215
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,179
computation but you know in this future

2216
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:39,000
where our computational tools are so

2217
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,139
powerful

2218
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,780
maybe we don't all need to be perfect

2219
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,900
integrators or like you know derivators

2220
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,900
and be able to like multiply numbers

2221
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,940
quickly and you know some people like

2222
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,800
doing long division but I I don't even

2223
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,239
remember how to see long division why

2224
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,300
would I it's it's it's silly to kind of

2225
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,880
drill that into children so they're

2226
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,639
happy in projects

2227
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:03,679
um

2228
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:08,280
to teach like kindergarten children

2229
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,139
um I like like a couple of projects not

2230
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:13,020
many some of the kind of Rules of This

2231
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,120
string diagrammatic stuff

2232
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,840
um in in this Quantum

2233
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,780
um information processing well this

2234
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,440
um of book Bob Cooker and his colleagues

2235
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,780
I think there was one

2236
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,900
um I'll check by Dan geeker in

2237
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,540
Birmingham and maybe one by Bob himself

2238
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,980
or at least he was trying to get it off

2239
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,719
the ground I don't remember

2240
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,820
um but at least

2241
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:42,179
where it has been tried I think they

2242
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:45,300
found that children very easily learn to

2243
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,040
use these

2244
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,400
these these kinds of languages

2245
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,600
um because it's just playing with

2246
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,760
pictures they're kind of much more

2247
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,239
approachable than this kind of scary

2248
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,560
symbolic language

2249
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,840
which is you know

2250
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,480
I don't I mean it it's a kind of fine

2251
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,300
language if you're used to like

2252
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,420
piping on a typewriter or like writing

2253
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,460
by hand where you're writing this linear

2254
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,540
way

2255
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:15,480
but you know if you go to like a

2256
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,540
mathematics department and look at the

2257
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,639
you know the whiteboards or the

2258
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,860
chalkboards there you know most of the

2259
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,840
time you see lots of pictures diagrams

2260
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,820
and things and that's how people reason

2261
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:28,860
typically

2262
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:32,060
um and so a lot of what's been happening

2263
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:35,040
with applied category theory is trying

2264
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,179
to like

2265
01:32:36,179 --> 01:32:40,199
take using diagrams seriously as

2266
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:42,420
mathematics

2267
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,300
um and trying to like say okay well

2268
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,820
here's what we can do if we do if we do

2269
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,460
take it seriously we can sort of re-cap

2270
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,500
we've sort of recapitulate

2271
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,560
some of these things which people have

2272
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,000
found like

2273
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,780
abstract or abstruse or difficult

2274
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:04,139
in mathematics before and like make them

2275
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:05,940
seem a bit more

2276
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:09,300
easy to reason with now and so I mean

2277
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,679
that applies to like abstract things

2278
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:12,300
like stuff I've mentioned already like

2279
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,179
at Junctions like the laws of

2280
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:16,620
adjunctions you can draw them with think

2281
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:19,320
string diagrams I mean you know I

2282
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,480
haven't shown it in my thesis but like

2283
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,159
you can

2284
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:25,800
if you sort of Google around you can see

2285
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,600
you know adjunctions in a two category

2286
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,219
and they end up being some kind of

2287
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,679
sneaky picture

2288
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,360
and sort of you get a sense of like

2289
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,460
what's going on there from these

2290
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,860
pictures like the flow of information in

2291
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:39,179
some sense

2292
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:40,739
um and there's a similar thing with like

2293
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:43,560
with limonas the the joke for like

2294
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,120
functional programmers that they're

2295
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,460
monads is like oh like you don't know

2296
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,500
what a monad is well it's just a monoid

2297
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,560
in the category of endo functors and I I

2298
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,880
mean that's true it's not just a joke

2299
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,460
it's true but the thing is if you draw

2300
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:00,480
what a monoid is it's like a thing which

2301
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,580
like like one of these like you see on

2302
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,260
that picture you've got this Gauss thing

2303
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,239
and it's got a black dot and you've got

2304
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:10,199
you got one wire and then it has a black

2305
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:12,000
dot and then two wires come out of it

2306
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,300
and I said this is like copying

2307
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,760
well like a monoid is like that in the

2308
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,260
other direction like you've got two

2309
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:22,139
things that go into a DOT and that come

2310
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:24,179
out with one thing so like when people

2311
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:25,980
say monoi they mean something like they

2312
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,780
often mean something like Edition you've

2313
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,239
got two numbers that come together and

2314
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,980
they produce one number well you've got

2315
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,080
like multiplication you've got two

2316
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,060
numbers again they come together and

2317
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,560
produce one number

2318
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,540
so like it's like the opposite of

2319
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,639
copying in some abstract sense which

2320
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,260
takes one thing and gives you two things

2321
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,900
this is something that takes two things

2322
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,120
and gives you one thing

2323
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,360
and so you can just like draw the the

2324
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,000
diagrams that Define a monoid and say

2325
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,560
okay well what does this mean for like

2326
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,540
Endo factors and you can sort of start

2327
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,460
to reason about it a bit more

2328
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,659
approachably I mean it's still quite

2329
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:02,219
abstract because it is quite abstract

2330
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:04,920
but it makes it kind of less scary to

2331
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,540
use this kind of language I think

2332
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:13,139
awesome

2333
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:15,120
yeah

2334
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,639
there's so much psychology

2335
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:21,800
and sociology and Mathematics and just

2336
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,199
hearing about yeah on real chalkboards

2337
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:28,380
people branch and they flow and they

2338
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,960
Circle things and they put an X through

2339
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,340
something it's like there's all these

2340
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,280
operations that can't be copied

2341
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,020
with a typewriter

2342
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,120
and as our

2343
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,179
uh cyber physical and social niches

2344
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:43,440
develop

2345
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,480
and we have different affordances

2346
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,940
different metaphors different Quantum

2347
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,880
reference frames for

2348
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,600
working and being

2349
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,120
it starts to make more sense

2350
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:00,360
for uh having a natural language that

2351
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,699
can express that

2352
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:03,600
um

2353
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,300
even in some yeah

2354
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,480
then I go and I said lazy stuff

2355
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,699
it just makes me think of a touring tape

2356
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,620
where even if there is a linear

2357
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:16,800
representation it can still in some

2358
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,139
other way characterize like a lisp

2359
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:22,080
program with nesting or hierarchical

2360
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,760
model even though yes there's like a

2361
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,739
linearity but also there's a model so

2362
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:27,480
it's not that we can't represent certain

2363
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,460
things with the bit streams or anything

2364
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:32,940
like that it's just that that may be

2365
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,340
more like the Assembly Language and that

2366
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,719
when we actually want to do certain

2367
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,560
kinds of work we may want to just move

2368
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,800
lightly and semantically with a high

2369
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,120
level way to think about math

2370
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,760
yeah totally it's kind of it's notable

2371
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,920
to me that um

2372
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,159
like recently

2373
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:58,980
I mean I I've been giving you know talks

2374
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,199
for a while you know using a computer

2375
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,900
whether or not like over Zoom but like

2376
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,760
it could be in person like you know have

2377
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,460
my like PowerPoint slides or whatever

2378
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,440
but these days if I give it a talk I

2379
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,880
just use my like

2380
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,100
tab like digital tablet and I do

2381
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,320
everything like all the slides by hand

2382
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,080
and I draw pictures and it's nice now

2383
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,120
that we've got like technology that's

2384
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,120
starting to you know be a bit more human

2385
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,060
in that sense and I think this is like a

2386
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,800
kind of mathematical technology which is

2387
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,120
like that although I think it's also

2388
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,920
notable that

2389
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,380
um it's still in some sense quite Niche

2390
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,659
and I think I mean I don't I don't know

2391
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:38,340
but the impression I've got from talking

2392
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,719
to people is that it's still the case

2393
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:41,280
that some mathematicians sort of think

2394
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,739
of this kind of like mathematics of

2395
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,540
diagrams that somehow like not quite

2396
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,520
like real mathematics because it's like

2397
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,580
it's too much like play in some sense

2398
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,020
um but I think that I think that

2399
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:55,020
perspective is changing and people are

2400
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:57,719
taking it seriously I mean it is real

2401
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:00,179
work and there's a lot of hard problems

2402
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:01,679
um

2403
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:02,880
and

2404
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,400
you know stuff actually gets done but I

2405
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,480
think it's

2406
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,040
it doesn't to me it doesn't really

2407
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,420
matter what like a handful of

2408
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,040
mathematicians think it's just what's

2409
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,400
useful to people that matters

2410
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,179
um

2411
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:17,760
and so I mean I I hope that you know

2412
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,400
these tools continue to develop and like

2413
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,440
you know we can use them in all sorts of

2414
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,120
different domains

2415
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:24,840
um

2416
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,800
I don't know you know I've never really

2417
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,380
it's it's no it's like notable to me as

2418
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,360
well that like human Vision it's kind of

2419
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,100
like two and a bit dimensional really

2420
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,360
it's not really like three-dimensional

2421
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,080
but you've got a bit of

2422
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,000
three-dimensionality and I've never

2423
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,139
really played much with like

2424
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,179
three-dimensional diagrams but maybe I

2425
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:43,860
will one day have some tools with my

2426
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,980
like you know Vision Pro or less not pro

2427
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,440
thing or whatever it'll allow me to to

2428
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,620
do things even more like naturally like

2429
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,840
actually like plug together some stuff

2430
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,940
in some abstract space

2431
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,820
um who knows who knows

2432
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,500
yeah

2433
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,739
the diagram being two-dimensional or

2434
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:06,179
planar

2435
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,219
gives us this kind of classical screen

2436
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:12,540
holographic screen that information can

2437
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,159
be written on that then Quantum

2438
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,560
cognitive agents can unfold into the

2439
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,880
imaginary

2440
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,520
plane with the wick rotation

2441
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,219
but also the boundary just like you said

2442
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:25,620
earlier can come in many shapes many

2443
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:28,080
dimensionalities so we could have a four

2444
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,600
dimensional boundary artifact

2445
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,960
that still becomes rotated into a higher

2446
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,400
dimension

2447
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,739
and uh

2448
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,960
that's not the framing or the

2449
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,199
mathematics that most of us have learned

2450
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:47,940
up to this point there's a really

2451
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,920
crystallized would be a complementary

2452
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,639
way to say it but um codified or

2453
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:55,260
fossilized

2454
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,780
sedimentary

2455
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:00,840
understanding of math education its role

2456
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:05,159
in broader thinking and what we learn

2457
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:06,540
along the way

2458
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:10,679
and the progressions get reified

2459
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:13,500
with who makes it through the pipeline

2460
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,020
so I think that's like

2461
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,540
that's like the the unknown unknowns

2462
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,000
here the known unknowns like we all know

2463
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,659
that we struggle to understand this

2464
01:40:24,659 --> 01:40:29,219
but then what but but then that's the

2465
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:31,440
real jumping off

2466
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,920
when it when it's not just

2467
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,659
us adapting into a new regime

2468
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:43,320
of learning and doing but when there's

2469
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:43,860
um

2470
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,620
composition and construction within that

2471
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,560
regime

2472
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,639
in our last um sections here um Dean or

2473
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:56,820
Ali another question or

2474
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,260
um what what do you

2475
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:00,179
looking to

2476
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:04,520
Bridge or Gap into the dot too

2477
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:09,360
Dean okay Elite please

2478
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,540
uh well yeah I actually I've written

2479
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,659
down a number of questions about uh they

2480
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,040
maybe

2481
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,960
um quite a specific and I think uh

2482
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,840
they're perhaps uh best and suited for

2483
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,080
the dot two discussion but I wanted to

2484
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,980
thank Toby for I mean I literally had

2485
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:34,619
goosebumps the entire time

2486
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:39,179
so uh it was really fascinating and uh

2487
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:44,340
quite enjoyable and I uh learned a lot

2488
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,440
and I hope to

2489
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,560
I I also have some additional questions

2490
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,619
in my mind I hope to uh get to get to

2491
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:55,679
some of them in the second discussion uh

2492
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,619
so uh yes thank you again it was really

2493
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:00,659
really great

2494
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:02,960
thanks

2495
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,739
Dean with the penultimate thoughts when

2496
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:10,380
you um what do you see us heading into

2497
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,420
yeah well what

2498
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:14,699
if it's if it's okay I'd like just to

2499
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:16,860
read a really brief piece of the paper

2500
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,719
because I don't want to watch this on

2501
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,540
Toby in the dot two without giving him a

2502
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,699
chance to think about this a bit under

2503
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:25,860
7-4 you've got fundamental Theory and

2504
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:27,719
you say future work connected to this

2505
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:29,719
thesis need not only be in applications

2506
01:42:29,719 --> 01:42:32,280
a number of purely theoretical questions

2507
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,219
raise themselves too and I love seven

2508
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:37,800
four one this this one paragraph It's

2509
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,580
not

2510
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:41,040
it's it's for me I call it a really have

2511
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,260
to slow down and enjoy the moment you're

2512
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,020
today Toby I don't know if you're a

2513
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,060
distance Runner an endurance athlete of

2514
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,219
some kind but your stamina has been

2515
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,020
phenomenal but this one paragraph to me

2516
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:53,940
would be like a refreshment station

2517
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,699
where they offer you a milkshake and a

2518
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:59,219
piece of battered fish like it's yummy

2519
01:42:59,219 --> 01:43:02,100
but you but you yeah you need to wait

2520
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,380
you have to pause and go I don't know if

2521
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,360
I want to do that but it really ties in

2522
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,219
nicely with the syntax stuff that Danny

2523
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:10,260
was talking about and I have a question

2524
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,420
at the end of it so I just want to read

2525
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:15,000
it though the mathematics of belief

2526
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,880
so you basically said belief is

2527
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,340
theoretical that's fantastic

2528
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,619
is a large part about replacing defense

2529
01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:24,239
definite points with fuzzier

2530
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:27,000
distributions over them independent type

2531
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,060
Theory we've replaced points with terms

2532
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,760
non-dependent terms are exactly points

2533
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,619
so a type of theory with belief should

2534
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:36,900
somehow Encompass fuzzy terms

2535
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,699
just as we can replace points with

2536
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:40,380
distributions we can replace dependent

2537
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,880
points with dependent distributions

2538
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,520
however the standard replacement moving

2539
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,440
from a category of functions to a

2540
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,719
category of stochastic channels obscures

2541
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,100
some of the universal categorical

2542
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,100
structure and underpins the rules of

2543
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,659
type Theory this standard replacement

2544
01:43:54,659 --> 01:43:57,360
also misses something else while it does

2545
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,699
allow for fuzzy terms it omits a model

2546
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:03,179
of fuzzy types

2547
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:05,340
we might well want to express beliefs

2548
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,380
about things whose identity we are not

2549
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,119
quite sure and then you say in the next

2550
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,639
sentence there seems to be a couple of

2551
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:14,400
related resolutions to this puzzle my

2552
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,380
question for you is this

2553
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,780
and it's not for today it's maybe for

2554
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,100
next time

2555
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,900
um

2556
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,780
it seems to me we have to Grapple with

2557
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:29,100
this idea of making fuzzy clear and

2558
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:32,100
making fuzzy precise and you started

2559
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,820
speaking to that and my

2560
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:39,480
my Wonder of coming now with a strong a

2561
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,060
much stronger active inference set of

2562
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,100
priors is there has to be something more

2563
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,280
to this than just a gradient descent and

2564
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,500
I think you started to

2565
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:53,699
speak to that in this section and so

2566
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:54,480
um

2567
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,699
I'm kind of curious do you think that

2568
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:58,380
this is a feature

2569
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:01,800
the fact that we can do this we can do

2570
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,980
fuzzy clear and fuzzy precise and not

2571
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,080
necessarily see that as a contradiction

2572
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:10,980
but actually the way category Theory

2573
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:13,080
kind of gives us permission

2574
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,420
to examine that so again it doesn't have

2575
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:16,920
to be answered today

2576
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,739
and maybe I'm maybe I'm misinterpreting

2577
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:21,420
what you were trying to say there so I'm

2578
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:24,900
I'm open to being redirected but I just

2579
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,699
think that this opens up a world of

2580
01:45:26,699 --> 01:45:30,360
possibilities and when I first read it

2581
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,239
um I I I don't know like Ali's

2582
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:35,520
Goosebumps looked like but I was just I

2583
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,560
was just like oh man I really want to

2584
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:41,420
ask you about this so yeah I mean yeah I

2585
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,940
yeah so the thing about

2586
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,060
fuzzy type yeah so I do I gotta start by

2587
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:52,739
saying I agree the the kind of the what

2588
01:45:52,739 --> 01:45:55,199
some of this is seeking is something

2589
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,239
like

2590
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,580
thinking clearly about thinking fuzzly

2591
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:02,340
in some ways kind of weird

2592
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:04,320
um it's like

2593
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,219
having some certainty about uncertainty

2594
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:10,920
um but it's definitely the case that

2595
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,260
still now like I think

2596
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,980
a notion of like fuzzy type theory is

2597
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:20,400
not well developed though I am aware of

2598
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,600
people

2599
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,639
various people having thought about this

2600
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:26,340
and people thinking about it at the

2601
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,560
moment and of course I've got my own

2602
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,239
ideas about it

2603
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,020
um

2604
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,239
but it seems natural right like we often

2605
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:36,360
think we know what I think like we can

2606
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,520
recognize a thing

2607
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,960
but like

2608
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,619
um

2609
01:46:40,619 --> 01:46:42,840
maybe you're not quite sure and so like

2610
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,100
you know you're not sure if it's this or

2611
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,719
that or you see somebody coming down the

2612
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:47,040
street towards you and you kind of

2613
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,719
recognize them as somebody you know or

2614
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,239
you used to know and then like as they

2615
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:53,400
approach that their identity becomes a

2616
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,840
bit clearer but you're not you know you

2617
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,480
weren't sure for a while

2618
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,619
um

2619
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:00,600
and I think you know

2620
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,840
there's nothing to say that

2621
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,960
you know we shouldn't be able to

2622
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,600
you know in some sense like types are a

2623
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,060
kind of elements of some bigger space

2624
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,380
and so we should be able to play all

2625
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,480
this math to it and it's kind of really

2626
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,980
about

2627
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:20,699
figuring out what the rules are that

2628
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:24,540
makes the kind of language of type

2629
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:27,719
Theory kind of align nicely with the

2630
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:30,060
language of probability

2631
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:33,179
um and it's a research effort but I'm

2632
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:35,400
happy to talk about it like more next

2633
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,520
time I'm also like happy to talk in any

2634
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:41,040
detail about any of the actual like

2635
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,760
specifics of the stuff in the material

2636
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,460
in the thesis or whatever else in

2637
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:48,900
category Theory you might be interested

2638
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,639
in like I'll promise me expert and

2639
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,080
everything of course but I mean I'm

2640
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,900
happy to try my best particularly if Ali

2641
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:58,320
it sounded like your questions were

2642
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,360
maybe of like a more technical nature

2643
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:02,340
maybe not if I I don't know if I got the

2644
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,719
right sense of what you were saying but

2645
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:05,580
if they are I'm happy to like talk about

2646
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:08,040
the details of that thank you sir I'd

2647
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,380
also like to like review any of the

2648
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:13,980
stuff like to to try to like say because

2649
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:16,199
I you're right that there's a lot of

2650
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:19,199
like detail in the thesis

2651
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,360
um because you know you make a flame and

2652
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,280
you're supposed to substantiate it and

2653
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,659
that means you have to give a proof and

2654
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:25,860
sometimes the proof is quite like

2655
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:27,659
complicated

2656
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:28,800
um

2657
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,980
but like structurally I'm I'm I want

2658
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,960
this to be simple or at least to have

2659
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,699
like a simple like

2660
01:48:35,699 --> 01:48:38,219
framework and so I would like to be able

2661
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:41,760
to like clarify some of that if that's

2662
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,800
um if that's you know if there's time

2663
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,960
for that or if it comes to it

2664
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,639
yeah that sounds amazing in dot two we

2665
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:54,480
will uh return perhaps any questions

2666
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,600
that people submit as a comment on the

2667
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,300
video or as a message in the category

2668
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,760
Theory channel on our Discord we'll

2669
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,639
curate those questions

2670
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,840
wool re-watch and digest and then we can

2671
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,719
begin with Ali asking some

2672
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,060
um taking us on a little bit of a

2673
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:19,320
technical journey and Toby thanks again

2674
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,139
for the incredible work it's uh defined

2675
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:27,179
our 2023 in many ways so it's been a joy

2676
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:29,820
and we look forward to next week thanks

2677
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,920
for plowing through

2678
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,280
um I think yeah there's also the stuff I

2679
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,139
I think we talked about before that that

2680
01:49:37,139 --> 01:49:39,840
we haven't really touched on this time

2681
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,460
and obviously I didn't really touched on

2682
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,380
much in the thesis about like how do you

2683
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:45,719
actually fit in like action into this

2684
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:47,639
framework and like how do you like start

2685
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:49,139
to talk about this like multi-agent

2686
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:50,820
stuff we can you know your first time we

2687
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,159
can talk about all of that

2688
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:55,020
two of the pieces just to share that

2689
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:57,119
that gave us some of the most laughs

2690
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:58,800
were

2691
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,840
um first

2692
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:05,340
we didn't get action and and we're like

2693
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,679
it's I mean just

2694
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:11,219
the the the it wasn't an anti-climax it

2695
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:13,260
was a climax of its own

2696
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:17,040
and uh and then also we had had so many

2697
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,980
discussions over the months of time and

2698
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,600
the treatment of time backwards and

2699
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:24,239
forwards ringing the bell unringing the

2700
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,440
Bell

2701
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,179
um all of these different concepts and

2702
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:31,980
then in your limitations you said we we

2703
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,960
really have to work on getting a

2704
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,159
dynamical

2705
01:50:35,159 --> 01:50:37,699
treatment

2706
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:40,260
oh yeah but I actually think that

2707
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:42,960
depending on like what you care about it

2708
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,900
may not be too hard so that's fine

2709
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,900
but even that you would say it that way

2710
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,980
just having dealt with time

2711
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:56,340
oh yeah yeah and then to be like well I

2712
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:57,480
mean it's like I thought that's what

2713
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,699
dynamical modeling was involving time no

2714
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:01,199
no so that that you're right you're

2715
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,060
totally right there so all I meant at

2716
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,320
that point was

2717
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,960
the the the kind of like statistical

2718
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,239
framework that I've been working with

2719
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:11,940
until then it just seems you have like a

2720
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,179
prior and like a way of make generating

2721
01:51:15,179 --> 01:51:16,619
predictions

2722
01:51:16,619 --> 01:51:18,840
but like the predict there's no like

2723
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,060
nothing to say that the prior

2724
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,920
has any like

2725
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:25,320
data about how stuff actually evolves in

2726
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,619
time or the predictions have any data

2727
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:32,040
about how like the since data revolves

2728
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,260
in time it's just like I believe that

2729
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,880
there's this on the screen and that

2730
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:39,179
makes there be this like stuff coming to

2731
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:40,800
my eye and that's it this is like a

2732
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,820
snapshot

2733
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,739
and so like when you want to include

2734
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:46,679
time evolution in those beliefs it

2735
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:50,060
Things become a bit more complicated

2736
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,820
awesome well

2737
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:59,280
thank you again Toby we'll see you

2738
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,360
um in a week in a day

2739
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,840
it's been a pleasure thank you for

2740
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,400
having me

2741
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,440
bye thank you so much

2742
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,980
bye
