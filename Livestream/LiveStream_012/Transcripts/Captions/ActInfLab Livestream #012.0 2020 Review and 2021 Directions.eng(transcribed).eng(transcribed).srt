1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,639
hello everyone

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,679
this is the active inference live stream

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,720
i'm daniel friedman today it is december

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,039
30th

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,880
2020. it is active live

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
active influence live stream 12.0 and

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,160
this is uh

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
hopefully going to be a recap on 2020

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
and a look to 2021

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
it is a doubly auspicious episode number

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,920
because the digits of 012.0

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
rearrange to 2021 and also the clock is

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
striking midnight

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
so there's no paper 12. we'll start with

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200
paper 13

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
next year welcome to

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,520
the active inference lab everyone

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
we are an experiment in online team

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
communication learning

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
and practice related to active inference

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
you can find us

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
at our website twitter email

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
youtube or keybase team and username

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
this is a recorded and an archived live

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,840
stream so please provide us with

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,960
feedback so that we can

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,520
improve on our work you can say

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
something in the live chat

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
or you can leave a comment

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
all backgrounds and perspectives are

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
welcome here

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,439
and as far as video etiquette for live

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
streams mute if there's noise in the

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,080
background

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,520
raise your hands so we can hear it from

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
everyone and we'll use respectful speech

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,720
behavior

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
today in active inference live stream

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
12.0

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,280
the goal is really to close out 2020 and

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,840
look to

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
2021 for all that that means

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
of course just like all the dot zeros

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
it's a context and an introduction

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,520
to some ideas it's not a review or a

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
final word

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
the punchline is that 2020 hindsight

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
looking back on it

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
is 2020 foresight and that's all we have

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
so let's figure out how to make the best

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,759
of our 2020 hindsight

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
so that we can have 2020 foresight

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479
here are the sections of today's video

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
first we're going to talk about what the

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
active inference lab

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
is becoming in terms of what did happen

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,120
for each of the three projects in 2020

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
and what will happen for each of the

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,520
three projects in 2021

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
then we'll go through each of the active

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280
inference live streams a single slide

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
per number 1 through 11

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
and just recap one figure from each of

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
the papers because it's a good way to

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,000
just

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,239
look at all the different topics we've

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,120
heard about

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
and remember how many interesting

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
perspectives and especially beginners

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
perspectives we heard

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
along the way because we're all learning

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
here and we all learn so much this year

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
then i'll raise up a few great points of

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,319
feedback that were raised by the

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,200
community

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
and we always welcome people to leave

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,599
comments and suggestions and if they

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,200
want to be anonymous they can

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,599
let that be known or otherwise we're

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,040
just really

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,000
looking to rise up what people are

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
saying and wanting to learn

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
and then let's just figure out how we

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
can make those things happen and they're

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,319
both

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,640
really good suggestions we'll talk about

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
then

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
uh there'll be more uh just sort of a

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
grab bag at the end with some

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
perspectives on 2020 and 21 moving

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,319
forward

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,560
so in the upcoming year there will be a

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,519
lot to expect and work on together

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
be sure to get in touch if you want to

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
participate or get involved

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
so for today's roadmap instead of the

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
sections of a paper because there are

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
no sections for this paper we're going

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,599
to be

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
inferring back on 2020 and we're going

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,200
to be

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,879
actively moving into 2021. so whenever

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
you're listening to us certainly it's

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
either at the same time or later than me

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
and that means that you're in 2021 or

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
later or about to be rolling into it

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,519
so how can we look to the past the

108
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,080
present

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
and the future how can we understand

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
where we've been to understand where

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,799
we're going

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,159
in this example with a background

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
picture of the rear view mirror of a car

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
it's like you're driving the car forward

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
but you need to know what's behind you

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,239
you need to know what's around you

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,680
so all of these things are important

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
spatially temporally

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
starting with the part about the active

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
inference lab

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,478
uh this was really something awesome

122
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
that emerged during 2020

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,919
with the special help and collaboration

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,199
and really was a true colony effort by

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
alex yvonne sasha rj and just

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
several other people who really made it

127
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
happen

128
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
this year with active inference so big

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
appreciation to them

130
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
and with the more people we've had

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
participating

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
and increased focus on formal structures

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
as well as values of transparency

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,199
accessibility inclusion etc we

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
resulted in the active inference lab so

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
not something that any of us thought we

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,040
would be

138
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
involved in at the beginning of 2020 but

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
again a year that changed so many things

140
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,199
for so many

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,639
people so if you go to

142
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,440
activeinference.org you'll see

143
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
this page which contains information on

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
the bottom about how to contact

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,479
our group through our shared markov

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,280
blanket

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
of these identities and so these are

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,320
going to be

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
always like organizationally held

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,840
identities online then you'll also see

151
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
at least for the time being this call

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
for collaboration for 2021 so that's a

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
form that we put out an open call for

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,280
collaboration in

155
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
in three areas that we're about to be

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
talking about which are in the domains

157
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
of education

158
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
communication and tooling and uh

159
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
so far on that call we've had a good

160
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
number of rrcps so we're really

161
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
happy that people are excited about it

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,479
and we're

163
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,280
open to not just participation but input

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,320
on how to

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
organize and make it in line with how we

166
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,400
want to see a decentralized research

167
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
community be and how to

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
how to have a good active inference

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
community

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
so the three areas of project that we're

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
gonna recap

172
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
2020 on and then look to 2021 on

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
our education communication and tools

174
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
and this is just

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,160
from the copy uh screenshot of the

176
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,800
letter

177
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,880
that is the url on the right side which

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
is the one that's on the website so

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
that's where to see this information

180
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,000
okay

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
the first project is education and it

182
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
was said as our cornerstone project for

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
2021

184
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,319
is a community developed open source

185
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
active inference book of knowledge or an

186
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
aibok

187
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
and educational courses as a result this

188
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
project will entail ontological so

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
ontologies related to structuring

190
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,440
knowledge

191
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,880
methodological that's processes and ways

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,280
of learning and doing research and

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
methods for various

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,199
areas and pedagogical related teaching

195
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,800
research and development

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
let's go a little bit into that because

197
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
i actually did not know about the book

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
of knowledge approach before i met alex

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,680
and yvonne

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
and their systems engineering

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
perspective

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
this is a graphic that alex provided of

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,560
the

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,039
systems engineering book of knowledge or

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,000
cbook

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,680
s-e-b-o-k and the scope of

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
this area and uh suffice to say that the

208
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,039
systems engineering

209
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,360
people have a really unique approach

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,319
that fuses the

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
multi-scale approach that

212
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
helps us deal with complex systems with

213
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
an engineering focus

214
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280
on defining interfaces and standards

215
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
and they took a very standards driven

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
yet flexible approach

217
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
as far as i can tell though i'm less

218
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
familiar than they are

219
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
in structuring their educational

220
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,639
material and so we can see

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
kind of around the edge we have various

222
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
things that are peripheral skills i

223
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,120
believe

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,919
related to the core competencies so for

225
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
example the left side people

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
competency knowledge so that's critical

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
and even though

228
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
you're going to be in this area training

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,720
somebody in systems engineering

230
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
it's also uh critical that they have

231
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
people competency so not just

232
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
social workers need that skill everyone

233
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
needs these skills

234
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
operational environment knowledge on the

235
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
right side that could almost pertain to

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,639
anything

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
and then in the middle there's these

238
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,919
core domains of

239
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
the curriculum and this curriculum

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,440
facilitates

241
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,400
easy onboarding easy referencing people

242
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,559
can point to a specific document

243
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
a specific web link and just say in this

244
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,240
section this was what

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
the way it was said was and that

246
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
includes

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,559
uh the foundations the introduction

248
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
foundations

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
the applications management

250
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
enabling factors related disciplines and

251
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
implementations

252
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
so perhaps you can see where we're going

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
with active inference here is

254
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
sep okay in their environment and this

255
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
is the part

256
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
that i think is built out to an extent

257
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
that's broader than merely just a

258
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
curriculum so the previous

259
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
slide this one contains information

260
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
about the way that they structured their

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,880
curriculum

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
as far as i see it but i have not taken

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,760
these courses in the way that alex and

264
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,680
yvonne have

265
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,320
where it gets really interesting and

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
unique

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,839
as far as a transferable structure is

268
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,320
this

269
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
scbok the environment plot so here we

270
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
have the community

271
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
which includes multiple types of

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
stakeholders it includes academics as

273
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
well as non-academics that just like

274
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
many other research communities do

275
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
within the community there are

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
professional societies professional

277
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,360
societies

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,240
have structured relationships using

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
ontologies

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
with specific types of other things such

281
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
as certification programs

282
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,959
competency models workforce development

283
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,720
initiatives so getting people involved

284
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
we could also imagine a participation or

285
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
a just

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
public outreach or public communication

287
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
initiative so there's all kinds of

288
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,600
initiatives

289
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
that can be related with an

290
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
organizational ontology

291
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,839
to our community and then we can also

292
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,880
think about even

293
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
products maybe there's an open source

294
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
robotics uh or an open source simulation

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
framework

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
that our groups develop so we're going

297
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
to have formal relationships within the

298
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
environment

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
the scbok is part of a developed

300
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
ecosystem

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
not just of a curriculum that they're

302
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
offering but also certifications and

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
professional societies etc

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
could active inference have a community

305
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,800
that is participatory so focused on

306
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,399
people being active

307
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,880
it's also professional even though we

308
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
recognize there's people from

309
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
wide variety of career stages we want to

310
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,160
keep it professional

311
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
we want to be trans-disciplinary which

312
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
means diving into the specifics where we

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,279
need them

314
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,120
but not worrying about what the

315
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,920
delineation is between disciplines

316
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
and also have an aspect of modern

317
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
organization like this clearly

318
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
has as well as recognizing the global

319
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
and cross-sector

320
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,000
practices that are going to come to

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
intersect in active inference

322
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,959
already it's seen as a meeting of two

323
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,320
different perspectives when

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
subfields of one area come to meet

325
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,519
and in this domain we're talking about

326
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,959
philosophy and we're talking about

327
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,920
mathematics

328
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
and so sometimes there's uh some

329
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
fundamental issues that

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
rise up so how do we deal with these

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
truly fundamental issues that we

332
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
often bump into as individuals or groups

333
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
well we all we also can uh

334
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
get around those or at least structure

335
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
around them to

336
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,360
structure space to hold those debates

337
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
within within a

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
more built out ecosystem like this and

339
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
that can

340
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
make us have healthy norms and visions

341
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,279
for our community

342
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,200
so of course join us to help because it

343
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
has to be enacted it has to exist

344
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,399
so join if you're interested second

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,519
project

346
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
we will continue the weekly active

347
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
inference live stream this being example

348
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,240
of

349
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
as an accessible and participatory space

350
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
for learning about

351
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
active inference we are also developing

352
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
new formats here such as seminar

353
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,279
presentation dialogue working group

354
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,160
and short video so here's the

355
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
communications

356
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
project so in 2020 we had

357
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
on our youtube channel we had 27 or so

358
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,279
participatory live streams there were

359
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
dozens of really great participants

360
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
so that was very special

361
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,480
uh over the course of the year we made

362
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,120
many

363
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,399
uh improvements in the technicalities

364
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
of the project so early in the

365
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
project at the very beginning we were

366
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,760
just using jitsi and then live streaming

367
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
directly from jitsi

368
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,079
which is a variable strength connection

369
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,639
and

370
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,000
now i'm utilizing obs software so

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
figured out what kind of parameters work

372
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
there and hopefully that's resulted in a

373
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,079
better

374
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,720
experience but beyond the technical

375
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
purely part

376
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,079
there's also been an emerging practice

377
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
for how can we engage in accessible live

378
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
streams and we don't have the answer

379
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
and we think that there's so much more

380
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
space to improve on

381
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
and want to hear people's feedback for

382
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
but we develop things like

383
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
checklists for participants so that they

384
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,959
can run through and understand

385
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,279
uh hopefully how to be prepared for

386
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,480
being on a live stream and that's

387
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
facilitated

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
hopefully some discussions that

389
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
otherwise couldn't have happened without

390
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
that type of

391
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
gentle normie and at this link

392
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,959
you can learn more about our 2021

393
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,480
plants so for 2021 for the active

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,079
inference live stream we're gonna be

395
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,959
doing it every single tuesday from seven

396
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,519
to nine

397
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
a.m pacific time whatever it is pst for

398
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,360
now but that will change so pacific time

399
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
and for the uh or maybe we'll see about

400
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
that

401
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,639
i guess we'll think about it uh for the

402
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,440
schedule

403
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,920
and participation instructions just go

404
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,959
to this link

405
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
and of course just let us know if you

406
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,399
want to participate

407
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,680
in any way in 2021 through this

408
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
means or any other or if you want to

409
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
have a special event or something that

410
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,480
we could do

411
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
on this stream channel if you go to that

412
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,360
link on the left side you'll see

413
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,279
this spreadsheet here's the current

414
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
state of it up till the middle of april

415
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
where we have the authors of the papers

416
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,040
will all be on at least

417
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
once and on the top are the steps you

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,120
need to take

419
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
if you want to participate as well as on

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,480
the top right

421
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,680
two awesome resources by jared and

422
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
barron

423
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
that are like hubs or repositories of

424
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
information about active inference so if

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,279
anyone has suggestions they can also

426
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,639
suggest something that should go up

427
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
there on the top right so we want this

428
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,959
to be

429
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
a good landing page for people to just

430
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,920
go to this short link

431
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,839
comes to the spreadsheet here's the

432
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,600
curriculum here's the year if you want

433
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
three months out you want to read a

434
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,079
paper that's interesting

435
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,320
let us know if you want to suggest a

436
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
paper we can also

437
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,079
do that here's the last area

438
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
of the active inference lab for 2021 and

439
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,680
2020

440
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,920
is the third project which is tools

441
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
so this says following our work on

442
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,399
active inference in online teams

443
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,240
we will continue development on tooling

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,839
such as knowledge management systems

445
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
collaborative research models

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
simulation of digital workspaces and

447
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
onboarding tools

448
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
here's a figure from the paper that

449
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
team com co-authored so

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
alex yvonne sasha rj and myself

451
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
and this figure is showing the online

452
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,880
team

453
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,560
in sort of a flowchart layout

454
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
that's reflecting the specific kinds of

455
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
actions that connect specific kinds of

456
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
actors

457
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,399
and it's basically uncontentious

458
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
that the team members are communicating

459
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
with a certain database or with various

460
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
databases and through these internet

461
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
backbone intermediaries they're

462
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,199
communicating or having specific types

463
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,720
of defined communication

464
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
and that can also communicate to

465
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
external databases

466
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
and our uh question that was guiding us

467
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,759
was could we think about those

468
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,839
computational actions

469
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
as basically going through a markov

470
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,079
blanket

471
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,240
slash influencing things across markov

472
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
blankets however we want to think about

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,639
that

474
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
passing through shared niches of

475
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
information there's a lot of ways

476
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
that the active inference framework to

477
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
us made us wonder about the online

478
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
context specifically

479
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
and uh this paper which explored a few

480
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
other ideas about the kinds of

481
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
technologies that would enable active

482
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
inference for online teams instead of

483
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,920
just

484
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,639
the kinds of tools that we have now also

485
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
this was just one of the other

486
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
figures that show the shared world

487
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
are informational niche that's like the

488
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,399
chat room that both people

489
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
are in that's their shared niche and

490
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,480
then they can send and receive from that

491
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,279
chat room

492
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,160
and that plays into their model it

493
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
updates their priors

494
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
on some aspects of their generative

495
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
model that leads to policy changes which

496
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,359
reflected in changes in action

497
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
here's where we want to go from that

498
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
paper in september

499
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
to something that could be more of a

500
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,000
minimum

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
viable usable for 2021.

502
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,119
uh as we head there and as we build

503
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,960
this uh tooling out

504
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,919
we want to first and foremost keep the

505
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,960
individual

506
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
in mind the human as the user

507
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,039
and we currently have a bunch of people

508
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
who've rsvp'd to work on this project

509
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,080
three

510
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
so i don't have any of the details on

511
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
that we're going to

512
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
basically co create that during january

513
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,200
and beyond but here's just some of the

514
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
questions and then

515
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
other scales of analysis that we can

516
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
build upon

517
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
hopefully so they're more just like

518
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
open-ended

519
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,039
things that maybe the team three will be

520
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
keeping in mind and i hope that we also

521
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
add to this list of questions

522
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,799
so one question is about how digital

523
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,200
user interfaces can shape and design

524
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,679
regimes of attention so we talked about

525
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
cultural regimes of attention

526
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
individual regimes of attention from the

527
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
ocular motor to

528
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,799
the uh rumination the strange attractors

529
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,919
of thought

530
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,400
and are we going to have the basins of

531
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,520
our attraction

532
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,840
drawn to the news feed or are the basins

533
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,200
of our attraction going to be

534
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
drawn towards deep work that's a

535
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
question and

536
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
are we going to design the niche to

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
facilitate individuals to choose

538
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
how can tools be useful and intuitive

539
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,320
for all kinds of people

540
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,080
and purposes and that's really important

541
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
because people use the internet in so

542
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,320
many

543
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,679
different ways and there's so many kinds

544
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
of people using the internet so

545
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,000
especially

546
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
if we want to be developing powerful

547
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
tools we want to make sure

548
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
that they're meeting people where they

549
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,559
are

550
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,640
another level of analysis to start

551
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
broadening beyond the

552
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
individual person is at the relationship

553
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
and the team level

554
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,320
so there's a lot of questions about how

555
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,640
could

556
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
online teams and projects be innovative

557
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
productive and resilient

558
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
in ways that were defined potentially

559
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
within the active inference framework

560
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
for example controlled

561
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
novelty search or the ability to

562
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,360
discover

563
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,320
innovative solutions on rough landscapes

564
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,880
or on

565
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,679
landscapes with very infrequent rewards

566
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
another question is about even just

567
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
given the current software operating

568
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,799
environment today

569
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
how could active inference on the back

570
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,080
end using just purely

571
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
analytical frameworks lead to useful

572
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,760
tractable

573
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
and meaningful analytics for teams for

574
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
example have an underlying generative

575
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,720
model

576
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,440
of teammate states instead of just doing

577
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
descriptive statistics and saying

578
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
here's the distribution of how many

579
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
messages these people sent

580
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
you could use some other type of latent

581
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
state modeling

582
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,679
to think about those emissions from

583
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,880
those peoples as

584
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,080
actors and uh as agents whatever you

585
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
want to

586
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280
draw the mark on a blanket around you

587
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
could even do that for

588
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
individuals for which you don't see all

589
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
of their

590
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,520
emitted states for and that can be

591
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,600
helpful in team context

592
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
and then the last level would be at the

593
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
communities and the ecosystems of

594
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
communities of practice level

595
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
a big question is how can online

596
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
communities be welcoming accessible

597
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
inclusive and trusting we want to have

598
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,080
high trust online settings

599
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
and hopefully have the hard like

600
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
cryptographic and soft like people

601
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,039
interfaces that allow that to thrive

602
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,000
and how can we have healthy norms for

603
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
facilitation

604
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,080
mental health communication in our

605
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,120
active inference

606
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,720
community but also in other communities

607
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,200
and

608
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,520
share the emerging practices that work

609
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
across communities while also

610
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
understanding that just like different

611
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,159
things are gonna work for different

612
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,039
people

613
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,799
different norms are going to work for

614
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,640
different communities so it's not

615
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,600
that one approach has to catch on with

616
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
anyone except for the people who like it

617
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
and always coming back to the question

618
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,320
of how

619
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
active inference might be able to inform

620
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
the way that we design these multi-scale

621
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
digital ecosystems

622
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,840
okay so those were the three projects

623
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,799
and if they

624
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,840
sound interesting you should sign up

625
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
and if it's past 2021 then

626
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
check back and there'll be another form

627
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,360
now we're going to go

628
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,400
one figure per 1 through 11

629
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,720
of the active inference live streams

630
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
kind of just to recap where we've been

631
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,240
to remember the kinds of debates

632
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
that we raised the the tensions and the

633
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,440
integrations that occurred throughout

634
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,880
this year just to juxtapose it get some

635
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,600
of our

636
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,400
laden connections uh reactivated

637
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
the first active inference live stream

638
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,679
paper

639
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,400
was narrative as active inference the an

640
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
integrative account

641
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
of the functions of narratives and this

642
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,200
stemmed

643
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,080
really from our initial curiosity as a

644
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
group

645
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
about how narratives might be understood

646
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
from an active inference context

647
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,559
because we all understood less than

648
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,320
about the formalisms underlying it to

649
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
wherever we were at we were at an

650
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,720
earlier point in our understanding

651
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
and the part that was drawing us in as a

652
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,840
team

653
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
was about teams and narratives and about

654
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
how narratives for teams

655
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
relate to how they commute it's caught a

656
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
communicate so cause and effect with a

657
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
narrative in the team

658
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,880
and the figure that captured it for us

659
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,080
was that in the online case the

660
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
epistemic resources and salience queues

661
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,360
are formally defined so if you're

662
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
talking about two people who have an

663
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
edge via a text messaging thread it's

664
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
formally defined you know a hundred

665
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
percent of when each message was sent

666
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,760
maybe you can read every message if

667
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
you're one of the two people

668
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
hopefully no one else or if you're

669
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,080
someone else

670
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
maybe you can even at least see the

671
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
patterns of their communication

672
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
the timing of them or the timing and the

673
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
length or some other attribute

674
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
but the point is that in a digital

675
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
system it's formally defined so that you

676
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
can completely capture

677
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,559
it's like a formal state machine in the

678
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
niche in real

679
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
world settings it's very difficult to

680
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,520
capture

681
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,039
the nuances of the situation in a way

682
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
that doesn't mean you can't classify

683
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
behavior with a 99 or 100 accuracy

684
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
it just means that there's uh still

685
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,440
aspects of the system

686
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,240
that are just empirically reduced in

687
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
dimensionality because you're making

688
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,120
measurements on a real world system

689
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,559
whereas the internet system it's like

690
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,400
it's its own digital twin it's already

691
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,360
the digital thing

692
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,919
so it's way easier to formally model and

693
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,640
what interested us was just the way that

694
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
individuals who could have shared or

695
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
divergent narratives who even knows how

696
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
to calculate that how do you calculate

697
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
narratives and measure them they would

698
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,159
be involved

699
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,000
in a sense action active inference loop

700
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,799
as would their colleagues and teammates

701
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,480
and then their teammates that could be

702
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,559
anonymous commenters in a forum or a

703
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,440
comment

704
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,840
thread it could be your professional

705
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,799
colleague

706
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,000
who is on a active inference lab

707
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
project with you and these shared

708
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
resources how could those be in cause

709
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
and effect and how could this

710
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
interface be designed so that it

711
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,320
shapes the kinds of regimes of attention

712
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,960
and

713
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
deliverables under the right timeline

714
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,919
under the right budget in line with

715
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
values

716
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,039
helping everybody these are the kinds of

717
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
things that could be designed

718
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
through the regimes of attention which

719
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,679
are none other

720
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,360
than the focus of the team

721
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,360
the second paper was is the free energy

722
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,679
principle a formal theory of semantics

723
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,080
meaning from variational density

724
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
dynamics to neural and phenotypic

725
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
representations

726
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,039
here maxwell uh really

727
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,480
helped us understand as always

728
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
some of the finer points philosophy

729
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,279
intersecting with math of this

730
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,559
paper and this is a summary

731
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,520
figure from the end part one and it

732
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,640
relates to

733
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
the connections between different ideas

734
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,120
that come into play or fall under the

735
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
umbrella or scope

736
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,880
of free energy principle slash active

737
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
inference broadly

738
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,799
and the key node is on the left side

739
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,039
this computational dynamics

740
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,159
so it's not quite computationalism like

741
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,880
everything is a computer uh it doesn't

742
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
have to have that kind of a

743
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
computationalist overtone

744
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
it's just a realist or pragmatic

745
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,679
understanding

746
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
that we are going to use computers to

747
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
model the dynamics which are the changes

748
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
through time

749
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
of these things we could also have like

750
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
an experiential dynamics a

751
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
psychodynamics

752
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
to be sure but any kind of computational

753
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,320
model is computational dynamics so this

754
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
is like saying we're going to be able to

755
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,039
phrase it with math

756
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
and computer programs so not too much of

757
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,480
a

758
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
pill to swallow there but it uh starts

759
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
getting interesting

760
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,039
with uh the integrations of some

761
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
classical and non-classical attributes

762
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,159
of computation

763
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,799
so starting on the top mathematical

764
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,559
functionalities are implicit

765
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,200
in computational dynamics computers are

766
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,559
based upon equations

767
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,640
equations and computers are deeply

768
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
related and the way that that bears upon

769
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,440
the specific uh framework that they're

770
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,559
talking about here which is the

771
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,480
variational density dynamics

772
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
is that there's a mathematical function

773
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
which describes the free energy

774
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,400
functional

775
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
that's a function relative to a

776
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
generative model

777
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,960
of a few different things things that

778
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
we're going to be describing soon

779
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,440
the second node on the middle is the

780
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,559
specific algorithms

781
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
again shouldn't be surprising algorithms

782
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,159
are computational in nature

783
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,679
the way that that gets implemented in

784
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,200
active inference is via

785
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
this gradient descent on the variational

786
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
free energy function

787
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
functional and then that goes back to

788
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,679
the mathematical function in the first

789
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,480
node

790
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
okay now the middle node in the middle

791
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,159
representational

792
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,960
structure ontology that's the structure

793
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
of how things are in the world

794
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
so then that plays out in active

795
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
inference with this idea of internal

796
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
states

797
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
so let's just say that my internal state

798
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
is the estimate of whether it's sunny

799
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
or not sunny outside so there's many

800
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,320
ways that the sky can be there's many

801
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
shades of moonlight and sunlight and it

802
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
could have many many degrees of

803
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,640
statistical measurement but the internal

804
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
state for me as somebody who cares only

805
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
about whether it's sunny or not

806
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
is a two-state categorical model so

807
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,159
organisms embody the statistical

808
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
regularities of their niche

809
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,679
but they don't need to have every single

810
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,279
degree of freedom the whole point is

811
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,200
that they are a coarse graining

812
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
or dimensionality reduction of that

813
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,520
niche otherwise they would be this one

814
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,840
to one that's the map that covers itself

815
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,720
so the internal states are a

816
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
representational structure

817
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,080
we're going to get into

818
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,360
representationalism in a later

819
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
paper but they are a representational

820
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
structure at the very least

821
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
in the statistician or in the

822
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,480
investigator's

823
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,919
analysis of the niche

824
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,520
okay fourth note computational processes

825
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,039
seems that that's under the

826
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
computational dynamics and

827
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,080
that's where active inference comes into

828
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,399
play which is the computation of this

829
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,080
active inference

830
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,600
uh loop as sort of a structural

831
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,559
computation

832
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,520
that's played out on bayesian nets or

833
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,039
message passing

834
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,520
or other kinds of graphs these forney

835
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,640
factor graphs

836
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,279
things that would be great to have

837
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,159
colleagues who

838
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,159
know more mathematics come onto the

839
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,080
stream let's have a

840
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,279
special presentation or discussion on

841
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
some of those mathematical

842
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,679
or computational formalisms the final

843
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,080
one

844
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
and this is where i think an entry point

845
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
lies for many

846
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
is this ecological component now that's

847
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
formalized on the bottom right

848
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
under this model as the dual information

849
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,240
geometry

850
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
which is this interface that's defined

851
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,919
by the organism

852
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
at its boundary is some type of

853
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
blanket some type of isolation there's

854
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,919
various ways i think we can think about

855
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,320
it

856
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,039
and it's clear that the markov blanket

857
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,840
concept

858
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,039
people are discussing and generalizing

859
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
and critiquing every day so

860
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
let's figure that out another day i say

861
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
suffice to think that for some systems

862
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,840
especially locally

863
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,720
it's the interface that defines uh the

864
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,520
inner

865
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,320
uh interactions between these two sides

866
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
so formally that's reflected as dual

867
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
information geometry

868
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,799
but qualitatively that's where the

869
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,960
inactivism and so many other parts of

870
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
the relational

871
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,600
part of active inference come into play

872
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,200
in paper 3 a world unto itself human

873
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,520
communication as active inference

874
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
jared joined i was very memorable and

875
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
here was a figure

876
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,360
that kind of like many other things

877
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
we returned to similar figures again and

878
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
again

879
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
but this one brought us back to this

880
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,880
core

881
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
loop internal states and external states

882
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,520
then sense and action these are the four

883
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,399
states

884
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,480
now here's the blanket goes down the

885
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,399
middle that's why

886
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,360
the metaphor of a quote blanket uh like

887
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,120
a fabric blanket or i don't know

888
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
what kind of blanket

889
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
whether it's that as a metaphor or the

890
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,919
tapestry or

891
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,360
whether you just want to think about it

892
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
purely without any words just in terms

893
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,960
of the exact

894
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,279
computational influences in the model

895
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,080
that's where

896
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,279
the debate in lies and then the symmetry

897
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,679
that was described on the previous slide

898
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,000
the dual symmetry is that the internal

899
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,519
and the external

900
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,799
are ultimately just following the same

901
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,279
computational structure it's sort of

902
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:09,919
like how

903
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,080
you could have experimental group a and

904
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
experimental group b

905
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
but you could have called them the other

906
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
letter that doesn't mean you could have

907
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
switched which one got the drug and

908
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,480
which one got the placebo

909
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
but you could have called it the other

910
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,679
letter so there's a symmetry

911
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,440
with the labeling though there's not a

912
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
symmetry with the treatment

913
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640
and so this four

914
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,799
state model is just something to be

915
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,000
returned to again

916
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,039
and again what are the states what are

917
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,559
the connections between the states

918
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,320
and then leave space for the unknown is

919
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,480
there something that transcends this

920
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
ask if there's another connection if

921
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,159
there is

922
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,200
it can be added in but if there isn't

923
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,880
this is a parsimony's descriptor and it

924
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
allows us to do this fractal nesting and

925
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,799
a few other things

926
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,840
another part of this figure was

927
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,840
going one layer into depth onto

928
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
how each of these states were defined

929
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,399
and how each conveyed

930
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,000
specific aspects of what the system was

931
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,480
doing

932
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,120
in terms of a drawing on various

933
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
frameworks using terms from

934
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,919
bayesian statistics other times using uh

935
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,240
terms from information theory and uh

936
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,000
sensation we can just map them really

937
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,919
quickly is the

938
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,519
uh sensation is is uh trying to minimize

939
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
the agent's bound on surprise

940
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,440
sensations play into internal states so

941
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,159
here's

942
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,440
the uh photons the eye is seeking the

943
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,399
uh is trying to bounce surprise on the

944
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
visual world

945
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,640
the internal states are optimizing the

946
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,200
agents

947
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
bound on surprise which is basically

948
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,279
saying given

949
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,679
the input the upward uh flowing input

950
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,880
how can we tighten our expectations

951
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,519
through

952
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,039
state updating and optimal policy

953
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
that leads to agent action to minimize

954
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,519
the agent's bound on surprise

955
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,159
so that's why sensation and action both

956
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,200
have the same

957
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,399
goal of bounding surprise that's the

958
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:14,880
theme

959
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,440
bounding surprise as defined by what

960
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
surprise is from this

961
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,559
internal state model perspective

962
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,919
and then the niche is also optimizing

963
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
the niches bound on surprise

964
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,519
now i think that uh

965
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,159
this symmetry is the dual information

966
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,200
geometry

967
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,919
but it remains to be seen a little bit

968
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,200
how that

969
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,039
would play out in a real niche i think

970
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,039
it'd be an awesome modeling

971
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,960
project or a discussion about how we

972
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,279
could think about what it means that the

973
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,640
niche is bounding its

974
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,279
surprise does that mean it returns to

975
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,080
attracting

976
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,120
sets of nitrogen concentration

977
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,440
so it's almost like if the biological

978
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,320
community

979
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,080
goes to a certain concentration in a

980
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,919
certain community variable

981
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
then there's a drawback what does that

982
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,440
exactly mean

983
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
there's a lot of these kind of gaia

984
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,639
related papers maybe that

985
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,000
could be related but this paper was

986
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,119
about communication

987
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,760
and so we went from the narrative sort

988
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,000
of down a level but also up a level

989
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
thinking about the turn taking

990
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
and about the way that communication

991
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,359
encodes

992
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,239
meaning and conveys meaning and about

993
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,760
culture and about the way that culture

994
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,399
structures

995
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,359
the meaning's interpretation the fourth

996
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:31,918
paper

997
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,918
brought us more directly to culture

998
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,119
itself

999
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,119
and that was the paper cultural

1000
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,119
affordances scaffolding local worlds

1001
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,918
through shared

1002
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,760
intentionality and regimes of attention

1003
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,440
so that's when we got into the regimes

1004
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,719
of attention

1005
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,879
mindset that was on our regime of

1006
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,000
attention

1007
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,159
and this was sort of one of the latter

1008
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
figures of the paper

1009
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,280
and it conveys this idea of regimes of

1010
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,159
attention

1011
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,200
quite well so it's sort of a schematic

1012
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,880
for a generalized computational

1013
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,240
process one that the authors posit

1014
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,480
may be plausible given neural

1015
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,599
architectures

1016
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,240
in people and also potentially

1017
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,440
implementable

1018
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,200
amidst a family of other ways that it

1019
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,800
could be implemented in

1020
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
computer systems and this relates to

1021
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,920
the uh bottom-up and top-down

1022
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,680
processing and it also relates to

1023
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
the bayesian brain multi-level bayesian

1024
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,960
brain multi-level bayesian modeling

1025
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,079
here's how it works the green nodes and

1026
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,760
this isn't

1027
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,320
maybe a colorblind uh visual but the

1028
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,960
right

1029
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,040
and green nodes are passing predictions

1030
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,599
to computational units on this left side

1031
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,560
of the column

1032
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
the computational units on the left side

1033
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
of the column pass their prediction

1034
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,040
errors

1035
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,040
up so this would be the the

1036
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,640
bottom most level of this uh layout it

1037
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,240
could be side to side you can use in and

1038
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,839
out metaphors there's other ways to

1039
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,520
think about it they're not always

1040
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
like a totem pole it could it can be a

1041
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,359
heteroarchy but in this one it's just

1042
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,359
laid out like this

1043
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
and it reflects how like the retinal

1044
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,119
cells

1045
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,359
let's think passes to the next link in

1046
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,240
the chain

1047
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
the predictions that uh

1048
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,160
it's going to give to the next

1049
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
computational unit

1050
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,599
and then the errors the expectation

1051
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,200
which is the deviation from the

1052
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,280
prediction from the higher up node

1053
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
is passed up so it's saying if it ends

1054
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,640
up that this

1055
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
is passing the exact same prediction of

1056
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,040
the light past hitting it

1057
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,400
and this one's getting the exact same

1058
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
prediction then it doesn't pass any

1059
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,119
differential

1060
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,280
so that's predictive processing where

1061
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
basically the downward

1062
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,680
cascading prediction towards the sensory

1063
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,640
cue

1064
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,839
is kind of canceling out expectations

1065
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,000
but residuals or errors propagate

1066
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,599
upwards and upwards and upwards through

1067
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,079
these abstraction hierarchies

1068
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
to the highest level in this

1069
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,680
computational framework again i don't

1070
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,920
know if there are other or future

1071
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,599
frameworks the topmost level

1072
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,400
passes this yellow area arrow which is

1073
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,680
the modulation of

1074
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,960
attention so that attention arrow goes

1075
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
from the highest

1076
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,440
uh prediction not

1077
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
uh yeah the highest most prediction in

1078
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
error coupled unit

1079
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
and passes it to this blue node which is

1080
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
weighting the precision of different

1081
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
kinds of

1082
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
evidence different levels of the

1083
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
hierarchy so let's just say we have the

1084
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,640
visual

1085
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,440
level and then we have a cultural level

1086
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
the cultural level says all cars

1087
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,440
are red and then

1088
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,119
you see driving really fast a car and

1089
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,240
maybe if you would have been uh not

1090
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
in such a strong cultural context of

1091
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,680
thinking that cars were red

1092
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,400
you would have seen it as orange there's

1093
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,720
all kinds of ways that our priors

1094
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,960
can interact with and ultimately

1095
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,520
structure the sensory cues that we

1096
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
receive

1097
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,400
and so this model captures that

1098
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
modulation of attention to either a

1099
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
cultural narrative let's say at a higher

1100
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
level of abstraction

1101
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,000
or a more sensory narrative

1102
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
and that modulation that precision

1103
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,280
weighting

1104
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,359
which could be performed by changing

1105
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,440
parameters in a computational model

1106
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,160
or for example releasing a

1107
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
neurotransmitter like dopamine into a

1108
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:34,800
certain

1109
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,280
area of the brain or type of synapse all

1110
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
these neuromodulators

1111
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,960
other kinds of non-neurotransmitter

1112
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,560
neuromodulators

1113
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
may over different time scales

1114
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
differentially weight different levels

1115
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,880
of this computational hierarchy

1116
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,240
and that can be considered the regime of

1117
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,200
attention

1118
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,359
because the regime of attention may

1119
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,560
hyper focus

1120
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,680
on small things it may

1121
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,480
due to precision waiting leading uh to

1122
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
changes in state estimators or like the

1123
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,200
relative

1124
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,240
salience of different attributes or the

1125
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,599
plausibility of different

1126
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
futures people's regimes of attentions

1127
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,079
may be making them suffer

1128
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,960
or maybe dysfunctional for a society so

1129
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
different regimes of attention

1130
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,320
may be things that people want to

1131
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,520
pursue or not and that was what

1132
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
this question of designing regimes of

1133
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,119
attention was so

1134
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,040
there has to be a regime of attention

1135
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
what is it going to be

1136
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,520
what shapes it the fifth paper we read

1137
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,119
was multi-scale integration

1138
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,640
beyond internalism and externalism

1139
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,680
and this was a great paper

1140
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,040
as really they all are and

1141
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,599
it was about this philosophical debate

1142
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,079
between

1143
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,320
internalism and externalism which are

1144
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
sort of like two

1145
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,560
extremes on a continuum or

1146
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,760
you can think of it probably different

1147
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,200
ways just like any other philosophy

1148
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,160
debate

1149
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,880
but to put it simply the internalists

1150
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
highlighted the role

1151
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
of the internal processes that is

1152
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,319
internal to the organism let's say

1153
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,000
such as things that happened in the

1154
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
brain and they highlight the importance

1155
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,280
of those things

1156
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,560
such things that happen in the brain

1157
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
things that happen in the cell things

1158
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,200
that are in the genome

1159
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
these internal and usually smaller

1160
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,960
things

1161
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
versus the externalists who tend to

1162
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,640
highlight the functional

1163
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,280
uh roles of external things which tend

1164
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,640
to be bigger things like

1165
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,839
social groups or city structures

1166
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,560
or civilizational level forces these

1167
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
broader level things so it's a little

1168
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,079
bit like the reductionism to holism

1169
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,880
debate

1170
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
but it's kind of framed in an internal

1171
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,880
to external of a blanket

1172
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
debate because everything is nested

1173
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
there's not really any debate about that

1174
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
it's a great observation to make but

1175
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,960
really it's the starting point which is

1176
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
why models like this are so exciting

1177
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
because things are nested we know that

1178
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,119
the only way that things wouldn't be

1179
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,920
nested would be

1180
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,680
if somehow there was a bigger thing

1181
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,280
inside of a smaller thing

1182
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,960
but that would be definitely

1183
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
definitionally impossible

1184
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
in the spatial world not in some other

1185
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
dimension maybe

1186
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,640
but in the spatial world it can't happen

1187
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,680
so in

1188
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,880
the kinds of systems that we want to

1189
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,160
model uh if not many many more than that

1190
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
it seems to hold this nesting so these

1191
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,760
kinds of models

1192
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,560
take that nesting seriously they say

1193
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
look we're not going to be able

1194
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,319
to simulate down to the lowest level

1195
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,440
that's not even helpful

1196
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,480
for example doing a protein simulation

1197
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,720
of the vibrating atoms can only be

1198
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,520
simulated for

1199
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,720
a couple of seconds uh milliseconds

1200
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,839
or of time and it's usually a very high

1201
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,960
computational cost so it's not even

1202
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,880
like you can go to every protein level

1203
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,560
sometimes you can coarse grain we

1204
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,800
we we can cheat every once in a while

1205
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
okay so how do we

1206
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,680
do that correctly and they use

1207
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,800
this idea of multi-scale nested markov

1208
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,599
blankets

1209
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,960
to get at a way in which we could

1210
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,680
perform multi-scale integration and by

1211
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,560
doing so

1212
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
integrate across internalist and

1213
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,400
externalist perspectives on systems

1214
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,359
function

1215
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,160
and so the way that this works is that

1216
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,040
there is a

1217
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,680
markov blanket around hidden states and

1218
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,640
this markov

1219
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,480
blanket or any other kind of blanket or

1220
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,839
metaphor you want to use

1221
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,640
it's a hexagon here has incoming

1222
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,440
variables

1223
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,920
those are the sense states and outgoing

1224
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,560
variables

1225
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
those are the action states or

1226
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,200
dependencies or relationships

1227
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,079
and it can be coarse-grained no matter

1228
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
how much complexity is

1229
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,160
inside of here in the hidden states i

1230
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,000
might want to have a two-state

1231
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,400
model friendly or faux or i might want

1232
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,160
to have a 50-state model

1233
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,880
which uh you know percentile of this is

1234
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,160
it with respect to this

1235
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,560
or might want to have a 5000 state

1236
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
that's a question about the mapping

1237
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,400
between the observer and this system

1238
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
because we're not saying that we're

1239
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
knowing that system we're calling them

1240
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,359
hidden states because

1241
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,680
we want to be clear that we're choosing

1242
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,599
which attributes to model

1243
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,000
latently within this because all we can

1244
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,880
observe

1245
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,839
are which sense data are being projected

1246
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,240
and

1247
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,839
which action states are being emitted

1248
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,200
now because of this course graining

1249
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,040
it's possible to perform some

1250
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,560
mathematics let's

1251
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,160
hear from the authors and other

1252
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,319
colleagues who know more on this

1253
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,920
to think about that as a particle

1254
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,359
within an ensemble at a larger level

1255
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,560
of similar things so

1256
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,599
here is an ant and it's getting inputs

1257
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,760
chemo sensation through the antennas

1258
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,400
detecting the chemicals

1259
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,680
mechanoreceptors on its body with the

1260
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
hairs detecting interactions

1261
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
all these different things and then

1262
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
internal states

1263
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,400
that are in the ants reflected by the

1264
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,680
way that it processes

1265
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,359
these input streams of uh sensory cues

1266
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,359
resulting in the updating of action

1267
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
states where its body is

1268
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,839
how its glands are secreting different

1269
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:08,880
kinds of things

1270
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,040
so that's at the single nest mate level

1271
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,319
but the nest mate is

1272
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,400
in a colony of other nest mates and then

1273
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,960
depending on how evolution shapes it not

1274
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,680
to get

1275
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,400
too off onto another topic that's the

1276
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,200
level where

1277
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,760
one could expect to see rival risks

1278
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,319
versus non-adversarial dynamics

1279
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,359
is where and how selection is shaping

1280
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,400
across this multi-scale system so this

1281
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,599
paper was really

1282
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,200
great and again maxwell just really um

1283
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,960
good insights these are good

1284
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,640
foundational papers and

1285
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,720
i think they set the stage well for

1286
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,079
talking about multi-scale

1287
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,359
systems in paper six

1288
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,079
we went a little bit deeper still into

1289
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,040
this

1290
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,160
two density idea this idea that uh

1291
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,760
the paper was a tale of two densities

1292
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
active inference is an active

1293
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,960
inference and it relates to these two

1294
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,160
densities that are being passed across

1295
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,560
the blanket through the holograph

1296
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,839
whatever it is

1297
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,440
these two densities q and p uh action

1298
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,920
and perception everything here that's

1299
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,079
what embodies the relational insight

1300
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,960
and inactivism and ecological psychology

1301
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,839
everything

1302
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,520
that fundamental relational perspective

1303
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,160
is related to passing these two

1304
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,800
functions

1305
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,599
across an interface that's the simplest

1306
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,119
way to think of an interface what goes

1307
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,079
from side a to b

1308
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,640
and vice versa that is what defines the

1309
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
the minimal interface

1310
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,280
just like computers with apis so

1311
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,319
what are these two densities because

1312
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,200
in what they actually are is the secret

1313
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,520
of

1314
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,000
how to move beyond internalism and

1315
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,119
externalism

1316
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,160
as per the previous paper and

1317
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,800
this paper laid out a

1318
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
flowchart for how variables are related

1319
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,960
and implemented

1320
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,760
from a structural mathematical

1321
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,359
perspective

1322
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,480
in a way that shows

1323
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,160
us how because active inference is

1324
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,079
inactive as suggested in the title

1325
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,520
it relates the two densities action and

1326
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,480
perception

1327
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,520
so the claim is because active inference

1328
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:25,920
is

1329
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,359
enacted it builds upon the philosophical

1330
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,880
framework of an activism

1331
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,640
and therefore integrates sense and

1332
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,040
perception action and sense

1333
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,760
just like those inactivists ecological

1334
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,880
psychologists

1335
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,440
just like they have been what they have

1336
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,000
been working

1337
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,880
on with the sense action integration

1338
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,520
this

1339
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,800
mathematical structure captures

1340
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
the way that those two densities here

1341
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,599
across the interface are linked

1342
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,960
so because active inference is enacted

1343
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,760
and it includes action in the loop as

1344
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,599
part of the causal structure of the

1345
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,560
model

1346
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,400
and part of the fundamental

1347
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,319
way that this is laid out at a systems

1348
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,359
level it builds upon

1349
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,640
the inactive insights

1350
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,400
so interesting paper and this

1351
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,760
graph is something that we'll return to

1352
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,200
in another uh later paper but

1353
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
it related how free energy expected free

1354
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,079
energy relates to

1355
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,119
policy selection policies

1356
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,960
have predicted influence on the b matrix

1357
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
which is an estimate of how hidden

1358
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,000
states of the world

1359
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,520
change through time those states result

1360
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,119
in observed

1361
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,400
sensory outcomes through time and those

1362
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,880
observed sensory outcomes through time

1363
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
map onto the way that the other side of

1364
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,640
the system

1365
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,599
is going to change through time here's

1366
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,319
its b

1367
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,319
matrix as it changes on the other side

1368
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,800
of the interface and

1369
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,599
the energy minimization of that let's

1370
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,640
just say niche

1371
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,760
in this case it enacts its own policy

1372
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,200
little pi and little pi

1373
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,480
ends up influencing how the policy of

1374
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,119
the top

1375
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,400
agent influences its estimates of the

1376
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
hidden states of the world updating

1377
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,880
so that's the feedback and the claim is

1378
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,839
that this

1379
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,880
is an activism specified

1380
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,960
formally or one way to specify it

1381
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,079
formally

1382
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,880
because it ties action and perception

1383
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,559
together so

1384
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,079
maybe it's simple maybe it's not but

1385
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,400
it's an interesting thing

1386
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,960
the seventh paper was variational

1387
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,760
ecology

1388
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,319
and the physics of sentient systems and

1389
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,440
this was another

1390
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,720
great paper so on the left even though

1391
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,520
i believe there was a claim that maxwell

1392
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,280
like walked it back

1393
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,119
we can remember or listen to where he

1394
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,400
said that but

1395
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,359
just schematically or heuristically it's

1396
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,319
just describing

1397
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,800
how systems that exist over longer

1398
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,640
periods of time

1399
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,200
also can exist over larger spatial

1400
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,240
scales

1401
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,720
so this has to do with order emerging

1402
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,920
from lower level

1403
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,640
activity and there are things that

1404
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,599
propagate

1405
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,520
at the subcellular level like a

1406
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,160
secondary messenger a calcium wave but

1407
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,559
then

1408
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,960
over larger and larger time scales and

1409
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,400
spatial patterns

1410
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,200
there is higher and higher orders of

1411
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,319
function

1412
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,559
higher and higher levels of reduction of

1413
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,440
uncertainty

1414
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,960
by understanding the underlying

1415
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
generative model and then

1416
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,280
on the bottom here are 10 bergens for

1417
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,720
questions

1418
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,480
maybe they could be laid out in that

1419
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,920
arrangement it doesn't really matter

1420
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,079
they're really more of a two by two grid

1421
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,040
but we talked about that in seven and

1422
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,400
it's a great framework

1423
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,200
and it builds on the 2018 paper

1424
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,640
answering short english question

1425
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,200
by by ramstead at all which is really a

1426
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,480
great one too

1427
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,440
and then on the right side is sort of a

1428
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,880
building upon

1429
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,559
the multi-scale insight

1430
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,079
from paper five and it shows these

1431
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:18,960
particles

1432
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,839
being linked in a way i'm not exactly

1433
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,359
sure with the math let's

1434
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,480
hear from the authors or anyone else but

1435
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,440
what it looks like from the coloration

1436
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,960
is that there's that same multi-scale

1437
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,160
insight

1438
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,240
but there is also the organization of

1439
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,440
agents that may want to

1440
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,520
organize into a higher level of

1441
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,040
organization

1442
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
and then that coordinates their action

1443
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,240
in a different

1444
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,960
way and another way to say it would be

1445
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,880
like collective behavior and

1446
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,960
individuals of similar or different

1447
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,800
kinds but at the very least

1448
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,079
interacting markov blankets that enact

1449
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,480
organizational schemes so people who

1450
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,520
wouldn't have talked

1451
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,200
but then in a comment thread they're

1452
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,800
arguing that's like

1453
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
an organization that wouldn't have

1454
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,119
existed unless there were that markov

1455
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:09,839
blanket

1456
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,760
interface unless there was that shared

1457
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,400
niche so this doesn't have to be all

1458
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,200
hexagonal and crystalline this could be

1459
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,160
very chaotic and online

1460
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,359
paper eight was really a great one

1461
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,400
and thanks blue for suggesting it it was

1462
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,359
called scaling

1463
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,960
active inference as an archive paper and

1464
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,760
alec really helped through email and

1465
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,880
also

1466
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,839
on the discussion itself with clarifying

1467
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,839
several aspects of the paper

1468
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,800
and this summary figure captures the

1469
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,720
results so let's go through the results

1470
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,880
and then talk about maybe how the model

1471
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,160
did what it did and the task that these

1472
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,440
results are based upon

1473
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,040
is the mountain car task which is on the

1474
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,119
top left and this mountain car

1475
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,599
is trying uh is rewarded when it reached

1476
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,440
this is when it reaches this flag and

1477
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,000
it's not rewarded when it's not

1478
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,760
and it has the affordance of either

1479
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,160
having the engine push forward or push

1480
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,200
in reverse

1481
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
but it doesn't have enough horsepower or

1482
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,319
whatever to

1483
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,040
just drive up this hill so it has to

1484
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,520
rock

1485
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,319
back and forth many many times in order

1486
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:18,640
to

1487
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,800
ever get enough momentum to reach the

1488
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
top of the hill

1489
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
the issue is that because none of these

1490
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,720
states are rewarding

1491
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,280
as it starts exploring the local space

1492
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
of policies it can enact like let's do

1493
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
three seconds forward or let's do

1494
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
always forward or let's do forward and

1495
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,880
then backwards alternating for 10

1496
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,800
seconds so then in 20 seconds

1497
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,079
whatever state space it starts exploring

1498
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,880
with these alternative reinforcement

1499
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,640
learning algorithms

1500
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,800
it turns out that that local state space

1501
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,920
of policy

1502
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,559
keeps it relatively in the bottom

1503
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,480
dwelling of this basin

1504
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,000
and that's because these reinforcement

1505
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,559
learning algorithms kind of require

1506
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,400
reward they need that sugar along the

1507
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,960
way to start learning by example

1508
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,359
and they can overlearn on initial

1509
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,640
example successes

1510
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,640
that's also an issue but they do need

1511
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,760
some

1512
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,760
help along the way to find some success

1513
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,000
and both of these algorithms the b

1514
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,760
epsilon greedy a little bit better so

1515
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,280
than just the

1516
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,720
straightforward reward learner uh

1517
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,440
they both uh managed to

1518
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,240
not explore a full range of the

1519
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,599
locations

1520
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,680
because yeah they're sort of dwelling in

1521
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,000
this like bottom zone

1522
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,680
active inference model on the other hand

1523
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,720
which as we've also been discussing

1524
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,160
takes sort of a different

1525
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,079
approach to this explore exploit

1526
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,280
trade-off

1527
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,839
it was able to explore a broader range

1528
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:50,960
of positions

1529
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,200
and a broader set of velocities so it

1530
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,640
was just accelerating faster to the

1531
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,000
bottom and then it was able to

1532
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
get up further on to the other side and

1533
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,079
there was great discussions there

1534
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
about the novelty driven

1535
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,920
versus the exploit driven and there was

1536
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,000
also another figure that had to do with

1537
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,599
a different set of tasks that was also

1538
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,000
pretty informative but this model

1539
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
was um helpful to go through

1540
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,400
and it just really highlighted the value

1541
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,359
to our group of being really specific

1542
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,880
about what the models were doing and

1543
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,760
also

1544
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,920
i think a lot of those who didn't have

1545
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,359
that much experience with the machine

1546
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:28,559
learning

1547
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,079
were able to get a peek into the state

1548
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:32,720
of the art

1549
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,400
of machine learning it's a paper on

1550
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,760
archive and it's being

1551
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,000
discussed by machine learning people and

1552
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,520
see what

1553
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,920
these algorithms were and were weren't

1554
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,440
being tested on what they did or didn't

1555
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
include and so that

1556
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,400
insight was just helpful as always

1557
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,200
number nine was the projective

1558
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,160
consciousness model

1559
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,960
and phenomenal selfhood that was a fun

1560
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,680
sequence

1561
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,040
and the two of the authors visited for

1562
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,839
one of the streams and it related to

1563
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,599
the intersection of a few different

1564
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,000
topics which were

1565
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,720
just to pick the most key ones were

1566
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,960
projective geometries

1567
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,760
and cybernetics and integrating them

1568
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,200
under free energy principle

1569
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,640
with active inference as a process

1570
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,559
theory so the

1571
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,680
projective geometry idea is that there's

1572
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,520
different geometrical spaces just like

1573
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,480
you could have

1574
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,960
a flat piece of paper flat plain or you

1575
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,160
could have a sphere

1576
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,720
or you could have a taurus or different

1577
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,680
kinds of

1578
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,119
geometries on different types of

1579
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,799
surfaces you can have different

1580
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,000
projections

1581
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,079
amidst those different types of

1582
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,359
geometries

1583
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,680
some of those projections are

1584
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,640
two-dimensional

1585
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,119
like the one on your screen and your

1586
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,079
brain does

1587
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,160
uh generative state modeling to infer

1588
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,839
depth others are

1589
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,559
actually three-dimensional um but

1590
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,040
there's

1591
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,599
a few aspects of this projective

1592
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,880
geometry

1593
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,240
that uh equate or

1594
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,799
uh correlate very strongly with in their

1595
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,480
mind what were the fundamental features

1596
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:06,960
of

1597
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,000
our conscious awareness which is that it

1598
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,400
has

1599
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,040
a non-arbitrary origin that appears to

1600
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,640
be somewhere in the visual

1601
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,200
field and that objects that are far look

1602
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,880
far and objects that are close look

1603
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,079
close

1604
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,440
you know who knows and uh

1605
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,119
they tie the functional attributes to

1606
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,799
consciousness on one half

1607
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,839
to the projective geomet projective

1608
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,040
geometry

1609
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,119
uh features as they're differentiated

1610
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,280
from euclidean features geometry

1611
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,240
and then on the other half of the

1612
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,680
functional features the goal seeking

1613
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,319
components were tied to the cybernetics

1614
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,359
and so the cybernetic or goal seeking or

1615
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,040
recalibrating systems approach learning

1616
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,720
single loop double loop triple loop

1617
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,319
learning whatever it is that humans are

1618
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,119
doing

1619
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,960
that cybernetics approach also

1620
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,799
constitutes some of the features

1621
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,960
functionally of consciousness

1622
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,640
this figure conveyed how uh if you have

1623
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,280
a two-dimensional projection that

1624
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,839
doesn't

1625
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,440
have any perspective cues then

1626
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,599
it's an undecidable inference there's

1627
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,599
two equally good solutions

1628
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,880
to whether this almost

1629
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,599
hints at being a cube but can oscillate

1630
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:20,960
between whether it's a cube facing

1631
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,760
top down or which way it's facing

1632
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,200
depending on how you see it

1633
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,520
so one thing to consider is people's

1634
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,720
priors on wire

1635
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
cubes makes them see a cube in this

1636
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,079
projection because it's just a

1637
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,359
two-dimensional projection so that's the

1638
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:35,839
first

1639
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,839
thing is that we unpack these line

1640
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,359
drawings into

1641
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,599
contextualized especially if it says

1642
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,680
which way do you see the cube facing

1643
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,680
it biases you to think that you're going

1644
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,520
to see a cube instead of like a logo for

1645
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:47,839
a

1646
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,480
company or something like that and which

1647
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,160
still could be a cube

1648
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,720
then once you're on the cube wavelength

1649
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,160
it kind of oscillates

1650
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,599
or maybe it doesn't depending on

1651
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,599
different people uh which way it's

1652
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,160
facing

1653
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
and that's because the two-dimensional

1654
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,680
projection is not

1655
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,559
telling you which side you're on but

1656
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,559
when you're in a room it doesn't seem

1657
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,359
that way

1658
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,160
and it feels like uh you're in a room

1659
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,200
and you know that you're in a

1660
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,760
rectangular room even if the angles look

1661
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,640
off

1662
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
and so they relate that to the goal

1663
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,079
seeking

1664
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,839
cybernetic nature and the projective

1665
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,200
geometry and

1666
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,000
it was a great and really educational

1667
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,880
discussion with the authors as well

1668
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,319
the tenth paper and the graph

1669
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,440
that will that i referenced earlier that

1670
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,000
we would come back

1671
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,079
to is the variational approach to

1672
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,240
scripts which was a great

1673
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,799
sequence of discussions as well because

1674
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:43,839
we

1675
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,160
had this kind of a mathematical figure

1676
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,280
but it was really

1677
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,599
a paper that cited and drew heavily on

1678
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,119
the social sciences

1679
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,680
and on the social scripts concept and

1680
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,040
shout out to mao for

1681
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,079
coming on and for um yes you asked

1682
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,760
would you be open to talking about a

1683
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,440
colloquium i would just

1684
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,559
put the details and i'll do it and

1685
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,000
in this paper uh it started with

1686
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,480
a review of the literature on the

1687
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,599
different ways that

1688
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,920
this scripts concept had been used and

1689
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,000
it compared it along two primary axes

1690
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,440
which is strong versus weak

1691
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,599
and internal versus external and so

1692
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,799
strong versus weak

1693
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,119
was related to whether it was a very

1694
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,000
deterministic

1695
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,400
understanding of a script like a very

1696
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,359
ritualistic or stereotyped performance

1697
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,160
versus a very weak script something that

1698
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,760
was more probabilistic

1699
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,799
or potentially

1700
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,000
not predestined in some way that's the

1701
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,040
strong weak axis

1702
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,280
then the internal external axis which

1703
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,319
was related to the

1704
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,000
beyond internalism and externalism paper

1705
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,640
was talking about whether there was a

1706
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,799
prioritization of internal factors or

1707
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,559
external factors so for example when

1708
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,160
talking about human behavior

1709
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,200
and this reminds me a lot of the book of

1710
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,559
professor longino

1711
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,000
studying human behavior about aggression

1712
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,280
and sexuality

1713
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,960
and about how different schools of

1714
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,559
thought and different kinds of

1715
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,160
biologists different philosophers and

1716
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,359
scientists

1717
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,079
different people believed that we could

1718
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:14,400
um

1719
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,839
prioritize the genetic causes versus the

1720
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:18,880
physiological

1721
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,119
versus the childhood the psychological

1722
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,880
versus the social so broader or

1723
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,240
structural factors

1724
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,280
and her book is just a phenomenal

1725
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,440
look at that so that's extremely

1726
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,559
recommended

1727
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,680
but in this script paper

1728
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,839
those two dimensions of script strong

1729
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,280
weak and internal external

1730
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,680
were integrated through this common

1731
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,319
skeleton

1732
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,200
scaffold so this is how the script

1733
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,079
framework

1734
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,480
is going to be partitioned just

1735
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,720
qualitatively but eventually in some

1736
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,440
places quantitatively in a way where

1737
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,200
there'll be situations where

1738
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,559
internalist causal chains are relevant

1739
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,880
where externalist supporting causal

1740
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,000
chains are relevant

1741
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,400
like there's times where a bird just

1742
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,000
hits the windshield that's an external

1743
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,640
cause

1744
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,559
that's not an internal cause you didn't

1745
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,920
cause that on your windshield

1746
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,760
but there's times where car injuries

1747
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,280
might be because of something

1748
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
like that happens to a neuron and then

1749
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,480
that leads the person to change their

1750
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,400
driving behavior and hurt their car

1751
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,720
so there's so many different ways where

1752
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,000
you would want to be talking about the

1753
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,680
person driving their car

1754
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,160
and not get caught up in this internal

1755
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,359
external strong week

1756
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,440
we want to have a model that is all over

1757
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,599
the map on those two dimensions

1758
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,559
with a common and comparable framework

1759
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,200
and

1760
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,880
this is just something that we return to

1761
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,799
again and again which is that there's

1762
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,640
time moving from left to right so time

1763
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,000
step one two three

1764
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,480
and at each time step there is

1765
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,319
observations that are coming from the

1766
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,720
world

1767
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,559
so that's like photons hitting the

1768
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,119
retina or things touching the

1769
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,520
mechanoreceptors

1770
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,079
and then the organism in this case or

1771
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,240
whatever the system of interest is

1772
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
is doing a state estimate on those

1773
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,440
observations

1774
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,280
and the state estimate is like a hidden

1775
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,119
state of the world that is being

1776
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,359
confirmed or supported or

1777
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,160
not through a single or a multi-chain

1778
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,520
multi-scale mapping from these

1779
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,480
observations

1780
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,559
so that's why once you're an adult and

1781
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,319
you have object permanence even when you

1782
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:12,799
cover

1783
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,200
up your visual field or your blink you

1784
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,720
um can still have a

1785
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,240
understanding of where objects are

1786
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,680
because you're doing an underlying

1787
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,200
generative model with a state estimate

1788
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,160
of the world

1789
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,480
a is the matrix that maps state

1790
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,200
estimates the world to observations

1791
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,520
d are the predictions of initial

1792
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,880
conditions and that plays into your

1793
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,240
initial state estimate in modeling the b

1794
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,480
matrix is a prediction of how states

1795
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,559
in the world change through time and of

1796
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,240
course that can be conditional on

1797
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,280
other features the b matrix

1798
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,240
which is uh able to be the same through

1799
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:46,720
time

1800
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,799
in a very simple model or could evolve

1801
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,839
through time

1802
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,960
is influenced by policy and so the

1803
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,599
example

1804
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,839
that comes to mind is always like if i

1805
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,400
take the policy of exercising every day

1806
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,319
that's going to change the probability

1807
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,559
of my state estimate for health moving

1808
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,240
from here to here to here

1809
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,240
so our policies change how the states

1810
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,280
the world

1811
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,440
change so instead of thinking of

1812
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,559
policies as just

1813
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,240
connected directly to states of the

1814
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,079
world changing you know you can't just

1815
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,119
grab the gdp

1816
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,839
and just yank it down but you could

1817
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,520
enact a policy

1818
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,760
that would result in the hidden states

1819
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,440
changing in a certain way

1820
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,039
and you don't need to specify every

1821
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,799
single way that that happens down to the

1822
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,160
protein vibrating

1823
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,079
because your model is a coarse graining

1824
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,359
of course it is

1825
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,440
power policy is selected this is where

1826
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,799
the control theory

1827
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,920
and the cybernetic side quantitatively

1828
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,720
comes from

1829
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,960
and the social script side this is uh

1830
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,720
sort of where the social pressure

1831
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,359
versus individual preferences stories

1832
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,160
come into play

1833
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,359
this g is the expected free energy and

1834
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:52,880
it's the expected free energy

1835
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,839
minimization

1836
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,720
that leads to policy selection as given

1837
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,799
the niche and my understanding of it

1838
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,200
what is the most likely course of action

1839
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,880
for me as that kind of agent

1840
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,240
to engage in and there's a lot of other

1841
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,400
natural language ways to say it but in

1842
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,319
the end it's about the specifics of the

1843
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,039
model

1844
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,520
and here's just a wireframe model but it

1845
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,760
would always come down to the specifics

1846
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,559
of the

1847
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,680
model and this paper was just i remember

1848
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,799
a fun discussion because we talked about

1849
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,079
a lot of real world

1850
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,520
examples of where scripts come into play

1851
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,680
so a lot of people had interesting

1852
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,039
perspectives there

1853
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,160
and also about how active inference and

1854
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,559
its understanding or its framing of

1855
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,440
narrative and syntax and semantics

1856
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,400
could relate to online communities or

1857
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,280
real world

1858
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,400
communities paper 11

1859
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,960
which was just these last couple of days

1860
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,880
and weeks

1861
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,599
was sophisticated affective inference

1862
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,440
simulating anticipatory

1863
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,400
affective dynamics of imagining future

1864
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,440
events

1865
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,559
and this was actually a figure from one

1866
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,079
of its supporting citations

1867
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,760
but it was brought up in the 11

1868
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,960
discussions and it shows this

1869
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,760
nesting of models that we just discussed

1870
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,039
on the previous

1871
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,280
slide with the states and observations

1872
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
policies affecting how states change

1873
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,559
free energy influencing that

1874
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,480
we see the same structure with a little

1875
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,400
bit level one more level

1876
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,520
of detail so here we have the initial

1877
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,240
state

1878
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,160
we have the state how it changes through

1879
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,440
time with the b matrix

1880
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,599
and the a matrix which is the mapping

1881
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,920
between the states and the observations

1882
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,359
there's pi the policy which is being

1883
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,280
connected and influencing how states

1884
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,400
change through time so that's this

1885
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,079
bottom part here

1886
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,880
here's g and that's how it was laid out

1887
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,520
here

1888
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,920
now we have g but we're going to add a

1889
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,160
few more auxiliary variables

1890
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,480
so the first auxiliary variable here is

1891
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,920
c which is the preference

1892
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,880
vector so the preference vector is truly

1893
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,400
an inextricable

1894
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,079
piece of this whole thinking so

1895
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,480
not like other statistical methods which

1896
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,680
sometimes can remove

1897
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,000
one from their preferences by making

1898
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,039
certain types of things

1899
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,359
ranked implicitly by certain features

1900
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,200
like their abundance or

1901
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,200
other aspects the preference vectors

1902
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,000
whether stated or realized or or

1903
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,440
idealized

1904
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,520
are an integral part of these

1905
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,799
equations because how policy is selected

1906
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:38,079
is about preference it is also related

1907
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:38,480
to

1908
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,559
e which is the prior of affordances

1909
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,039
for policy so that's related to these

1910
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,319
ideas we talked about

1911
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:50,400
like the um field of affordances

1912
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,720
and the skilled intentionality framework

1913
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,480
and the entire uh umvelt

1914
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,799
and ecological psychological angle that

1915
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:01,839
is so

1916
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,200
nicely uh introduced by axel constant

1917
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,400
yellow bruinberg and others this

1918
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,039
field of affordances is like the priors

1919
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,280
over what action is possible

1920
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,760
so if all of a sudden some i heard some

1921
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,400
noise

1922
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,319
and that makes the likelihood of some

1923
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,079
generative model like there's some type

1924
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,920
of thing happening outside of my door

1925
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,240
in my office changes the likelihood of

1926
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,520
that from one in a million to

1927
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,839
one and five and then i start thinking

1928
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:28,799
about policy

1929
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,760
well policy thinking should be reflected

1930
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,599
by a weighting in what is possible it

1931
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,880
shouldn't be like i should be sitting

1932
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,480
here thinking about teleporting out of

1933
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,359
my office

1934
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,359
because it's not a policy i can engage

1935
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,280
in so that's down weighted we can think

1936
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,000
of and so

1937
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,160
the ways that policies are selected is

1938
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,119
through the free energy

1939
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,720
minimization or it's expect the

1940
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,119
minimization of its expectation

1941
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,480
as it relates to the prior and the

1942
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,280
field of affordances and the preferences

1943
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,520
this free energy minimization

1944
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,640
is mediated by a

1945
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,599
prior and a posterior over precision and

1946
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,280
so the prior and the posterior over

1947
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,119
precision beta and gamma

1948
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,960
um are both related to precision but it

1949
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,160
has a prior and a posterior

1950
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,520
component so that means that it's

1951
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,920
getting updated through time so this

1952
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,760
precision parameter is being updated

1953
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,600
through time as

1954
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,839
things change as observations come in as

1955
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,439
actions are performed

1956
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,759
and it relates to how confident the

1957
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:25,120
organism is

1958
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,399
in its model of cognition so that's why

1959
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:28,719
this

1960
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,238
m4 is called the generative model of

1961
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,759
implicit metacognition

1962
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,679
because it's a confidence estimator

1963
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,279
which could be delusional or it could be

1964
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,158
adaptive

1965
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,920
or some other adjective in

1966
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,120
the organism's uh model which is a

1967
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,198
phenotypic congruent as in i am that

1968
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:46,238
kind of agent

1969
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:50,080
model of actions that has to do with

1970
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,120
the way that hidden stages of the world

1971
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,359
are reflected in observed states

1972
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,080
so if you believe that you are a certain

1973
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,439
type of agent but seeing something

1974
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,040
different in the observations

1975
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,479
then that is going to lead to a

1976
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,319
discongruity and an

1977
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,880
imprecision in this total stack as it

1978
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,040
moves through time

1979
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,960
so cool that was the 11

1980
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,279
papers here we are in 12.

1981
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,080
12 which doesn't have a paper i put a

1982
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,880
clock

1983
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,000
because again it strikes midnight and

1984
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,600
uh only once on 2020 and here at active

1985
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,399
inference lab

1986
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,359
we learn around the clock what does that

1987
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,158
mean

1988
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,640
that means we aim to include people

1989
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,520
across

1990
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,880
areas and time zones and

1991
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,600
we provide shared structure shared

1992
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,319
structure

1993
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,080
is the enabling architecture for meaning

1994
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,679
shared structure is what helps us

1995
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,759
synchronize it really

1996
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,799
helps us with our shared sense making

1997
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,000
and we return to attracting sets of

1998
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,280
ideas and other kinds of attracting sets

1999
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,400
again and again and

2000
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,280
i'm gonna just look into the live chat

2001
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:05,760
and

2002
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,960
somebody with the uh initials a s wrote

2003
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,520
hi it's my first time here i've read

2004
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,280
about carl fristen and the free energy

2005
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,080
principle

2006
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,000
what are the resources that i need to

2007
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,920
get into to get involved

2008
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,320
this is a great question and i

2009
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,760
appreciate it

2010
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,760
it is an attracting set that we should

2011
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,280
always be returning to

2012
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,000
which is how can we get involved how can

2013
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,040
we participate

2014
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,360
and then on the other side of the

2015
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,159
blanket

2016
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,560
how can we make it easier to participate

2017
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,199
so

2018
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,280
the answer to that question is go to

2019
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,159
activeinference.org

2020
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,120
and there hopefully you will find

2021
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,719
starting resources

2022
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,920
on how to learn more about

2023
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,960
this area so one resource is this

2024
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,120
live stream and the curriculum of papers

2025
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,480
that we discuss

2026
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,520
and then um in the upcoming year

2027
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,400
we're going to be hopefully developing

2028
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,199
more types of educational resources

2029
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:07,360
and if you go to the 2021 podcast

2030
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,600
uh you know live stream calendar

2031
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,120
spreadsheet that i showed

2032
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,560
earlier the the short link

2033
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,920
uh you'll see on the top right two

2034
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,640
resources that was of baron and jared

2035
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,520
that

2036
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,640
contain a ton of resources so another

2037
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,719
thing that i would highlight here is

2038
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,679
that

2039
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,239
uh if you're really curious about this

2040
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:30,960
just

2041
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,719
stay in touch so get a keybase username

2042
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,960
and join our team or whatever platform

2043
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,560
we're using in the future

2044
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,280
or email us but just if you're curious

2045
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,040
about something

2046
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,000
email us or put it in a comment in a

2047
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,960
thread

2048
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,199
and we'll develop better platforms for

2049
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,640
curating and connecting

2050
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,600
people on these questions but stay

2051
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,159
involved

2052
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,640
and curious and in the community and

2053
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,400
read the articles at whatever

2054
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,600
level you feel comfortable with them and

2055
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,040
it will always be helpful to have

2056
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,800
somebody to read them

2057
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,960
with and a group to read them with

2058
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,640
whether it's on a live stream or whether

2059
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,840
it's not on a live stream

2060
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,040
whether it's just on email and um if you

2061
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,840
don't know

2062
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,400
what to read next or what video to watch

2063
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,199
next

2064
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,120
you should just ask the question like

2065
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,880
hey i'm really into

2066
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,000
this and that i know about this but i'm

2067
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,960
curious about

2068
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,920
that can anyone recommend me a paper to

2069
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,199
read or

2070
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,560
i don't know if i could read a whole

2071
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,159
scientific paper right now but can

2072
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,920
anyone recommend me an article

2073
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,920
about this or any other kind of request

2074
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,920
so i'd say that's the best way to

2075
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,719
get involved is activeinference.org will

2076
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,239
always be the most updated thing and

2077
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,320
we're going to make that a lot more

2078
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,239
informative in the future and you can

2079
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,159
read through things that we've discussed

2080
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,480
on this uh

2081
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,400
active inference live stream and then

2082
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,840
really just

2083
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,880
be socially communicative and

2084
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,320
ask people just through private email

2085
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,520
to us or to anyone or just a public

2086
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,080
comment

2087
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,520
especially if you think it's a question

2088
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,840
that other people might have

2089
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,640
um if that answers your question please

2090
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,239
let me know otherwise anyone else free

2091
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:16,719
to

2092
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,120
ask questions here's two pieces of

2093
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,080
feedback from

2094
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,360
the community that were sent in the days

2095
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,320
leading up to

2096
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,280
preparing this and i'll start with the

2097
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,440
top one

2098
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,320
saramono wrote i just want to see a kind

2099
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,920
of toy model with a number of relatable

2100
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,000
variables that are tenable and tractable

2101
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,360
one of the challenges i have with

2102
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,960
understanding this stuff is it seems

2103
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,640
like you find out what the variables are

2104
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,920
through the model and then find out

2105
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,199
there's a gazillion of them and it's

2106
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,199
hard to trace how things converge

2107
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,199
maybe i'm wrong or this is too naive of

2108
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,120
a wish but i want to be able to step

2109
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,560
through python matrices

2110
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,320
to see how the model changes at each

2111
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,080
stage yes good

2112
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,400
point good question so it points to a

2113
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,920
need for

2114
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,960
interactive notebooks and other kinds of

2115
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,840
technology

2116
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,080
that allow us to very uh granularly

2117
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,520
play with and see and explore

2118
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,000
these models it's one thing to see it

2119
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,239
graphically laid out in a figure as we

2120
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,320
had in some of these previous slides

2121
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,480
it's a whole another thing as you put it

2122
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,320
for those variables to converge

2123
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,920
on a functional state so that's a great

2124
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,679
point and also the tractable and tenable

2125
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,440
would be cool because then people could

2126
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,199
apply it to different kinds of models

2127
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,440
so we wouldn't want this notebook to be

2128
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,719
full of esoteric

2129
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,440
code it should be well commented could

2130
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,120
it be in multiple languages multiple

2131
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,840
computer languages or could it be in

2132
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,800
multiple natural languages with the

2133
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,679
commenting

2134
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,840
could it cross render in a way that

2135
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,880
helps people learn

2136
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,920
could we collab on the code

2137
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,520
we want to be able to make that

2138
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,199
experience helpful because again

2139
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,760
it's not just what to read it's also how

2140
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,679
to be communicating and

2141
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,760
being the kind of person who's coming to

2142
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,960
understand it and

2143
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,400
everyone's going to be learning the math

2144
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,960
forever i mean you could get your phd

2145
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,320
on a sub sub sub math area so

2146
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,600
we're talking about multiple areas of

2147
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,520
math so no one's going to be that deep

2148
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,480
in the game

2149
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,280
so it's about the community so that's

2150
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,840
the cool

2151
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,080
thing is just you'll come to understand

2152
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,400
what you're interested in doing is it

2153
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,760
applying it to

2154
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,600
your area is it um just looking at what

2155
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,120
kinds of projects people are interested

2156
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:27,679
in

2157
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,719
in for the rcps it includes youth

2158
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:31,679
education

2159
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,719
theory crafting entrepreneurship study

2160
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,159
groups so there's a lot of things that

2161
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,080
people are interested in doing to say

2162
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,800
nothing of

2163
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,400
robotics and other deliverables so

2164
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,840
um i hope that a common uh resource

2165
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,000
is the kind of computational clarity

2166
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,679
that ceremony is getting at though so

2167
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:50,719
thanks for that

2168
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,840
mao wrote um that

2169
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,520
it would be nice to see adapted

2170
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,679
implementations and cross-disciplinary

2171
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,040
lingua franca

2172
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,960
which is great because it's um that's

2173
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,080
like the french

2174
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,880
language the french tongue yet it's an

2175
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,239
english

2176
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,960
communication ostensibly but it just

2177
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,719
means common speak

2178
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,880
um and that is part of the question

2179
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,239
and it's fun to cross languages how do

2180
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,040
we have

2181
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,320
the right trade-off with accessible

2182
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,440
but specific language as well as

2183
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,159
non-violent

2184
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,040
communication and very accessible and

2185
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,000
intercultural

2186
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,040
norms so it's not just about the

2187
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,719
rigor and the precision in language

2188
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,440
because you can go down that rabbit hole

2189
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,679
and not come out just like you can go

2190
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,199
down the other side

2191
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,760
of caring about how the words are

2192
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,520
strictly perceived by an infinite

2193
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,400
set of possible external actors

2194
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,440
somewhere in the middle

2195
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,159
is productive research that's also going

2196
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,440
to be

2197
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,600
really productive for hopefully a wide

2198
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,199
variety of people

2199
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,560
and it's a a good piece of feedback

2200
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,600
because one of the lingua francas if you

2201
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,400
will

2202
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,679
is practice and adapted implementations

2203
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,159
so the cross-disciplinarity the

2204
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,440
interfaces between the different

2205
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,640
disciplines

2206
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,159
are not just the undergraduate majors in

2207
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,440
the university

2208
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,719
and having the biologists the

2209
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,480
mathematicians and the social scientists

2210
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,600
come together

2211
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,159
it's also about understanding theory and

2212
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,040
practice

2213
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,679
and understanding how people who want to

2214
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,040
be interacting with

2215
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,920
active inference from so many different

2216
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,520
perspectives so just like

2217
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,800
there's biology education of all kinds

2218
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,600
and

2219
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,560
could and should be more adult education

2220
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,400
in all these different areas

2221
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,239
active inference hopefully will be

2222
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,840
something that's a lifelong

2223
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,880
learning journey and i think especially

2224
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,280
with

2225
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,360
some of these um things that people

2226
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,040
wrote in the rsvps

2227
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,520
with the youth education i'm just really

2228
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,320
excited

2229
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,400
to understand what that could look like

2230
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,760
too because we could all

2231
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,960
use youth education and

2232
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,719
um uh as wrote thanks that was helpful

2233
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,400
i'll try following thank you

2234
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,640
cool so now on to just the random

2235
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,080
section something uh i can't remember

2236
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,800
where i

2237
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,199
heard it but it was this idea of mirrors

2238
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,000
and windows

2239
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,280
and two kinds of interfaces and

2240
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,320
the window is one that you look through

2241
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,239
and the mirror reflects us bizarrely now

2242
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,679
uh what we what we see is a generative

2243
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:34,640
model of the world

2244
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,400
so first off how weird is it that our

2245
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,320
generative model of the world

2246
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,040
can either make a surface transparent or

2247
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:41,840
not

2248
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,719
i mean shouldn't you be able to imagine

2249
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,400
what's on the other side of a wall so

2250
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,600
maybe

2251
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
that's what looking through things is

2252
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,040
sometimes

2253
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,760
in the visual dimension or not when

2254
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,320
different

2255
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,560
levels of precision in different parts

2256
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,600
of the world

2257
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,800
peer through so there's so much

2258
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,360
that that could relate to but another

2259
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,800
way that this relates is

2260
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,679
in the discussion i think in nine with

2261
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:08,000
this

2262
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,360
transparent concept uh the transparent

2263
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,440
concept the water we swim in

2264
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,560
is the things that are so fundamental

2265
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,560
that they don't seem like they're up for

2266
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,360
debate or distinction which is the whole

2267
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,719
nuance of zenko on and

2268
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,280
of this consciousness studies area is

2269
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:27,840
that it's

2270
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,159
it's the very subtle and potentially

2271
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,360
even ineffable

2272
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,120
aspects of consciousness that are its

2273
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,400
fundamental attributes

2274
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,000
and potentially the most fundamental

2275
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,440
attributes are those which are not

2276
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,040
directly experienced at least under

2277
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:39,520
normal

2278
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,440
consciousness so there's this

2279
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,360
distinction between the window

2280
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,480
which is the concept is it's us

2281
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,679
seeing things from the outside in

2282
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,080
but um it's almost like your eye is

2283
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,800
radiating

2284
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,719
outwards from the generative model

2285
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,679
distribution perspective

2286
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,239
as opposed to the mirror which reflects

2287
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,000
us but it reflects us potentially

2288
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,960
bizarrely

2289
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,480
reflected up down left right who knows

2290
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,719
all kinds of bizarre reflections in the

2291
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,159
echo chamber

2292
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,639
and then that made me think about the

2293
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,760
two common sayings

2294
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,080
that uh if you're in a glass house don't

2295
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,840
throw stones

2296
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,760
and then the second one was a hall of

2297
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,120
mirrors which is

2298
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,239
uh being in a diluted state so the it's

2299
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,120
funny that the

2300
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,280
common wisdom around these two kinds of

2301
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,239
interfaces

2302
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,560
for the glass for the well they're both

2303
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,360
glass

2304
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,080
but for the window it's saying if if you

2305
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,520
live a transparent life

2306
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,960
you shouldn't commit aggressions

2307
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,840
or transgressions and then on the other

2308
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,920
hand so if your interfaces are too

2309
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,040
transparent

2310
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,800
you have to live increasingly

2311
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,400
responsibly

2312
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,400
on the other hand if you live in a hall

2313
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,679
of mirrors

2314
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,760
it doesn't say don't throw stones you're

2315
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,679
just in a delusion

2316
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,600
any stone you throw would actually

2317
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,440
potentially even draw you out of the

2318
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,239
illusion

2319
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,159
by disrupting some of the feedback

2320
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,520
mechanisms

2321
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,440
so pretty interesting and uh

2322
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,040
just 20 20 on the close video

2323
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,639
just really time to look back and look

2324
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,360
at the self

2325
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,600
look into the future these are always

2326
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,960
critical things but they're taking on

2327
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,199
special relevance now

2328
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,719
just one little

2329
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,520
foray into the synergetic realm and this

2330
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,400
is drawing on

2331
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,520
some of the dissertation and work by

2332
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,199
dr cheryl clark on the social

2333
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,960
synergetics site

2334
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,120
and i just happened to be reading this

2335
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,239
and i found

2336
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,920
this figure and i just

2337
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,760
was already planning to do the clock

2338
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,840
with the 12 and so i just thought

2339
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,400
it looked like the clock and so it would

2340
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,920
be cool to

2341
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,000
go there and uh

2342
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,080
i wonder if active inference can be

2343
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,159
related to synergetics so what is

2344
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,440
synergetics really there's so much to

2345
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,360
say here but synergetics contains

2346
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,000
elements

2347
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,760
of a few different areas of mathematics

2348
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,000
and i started with this quote unity is

2349
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,760
plural and at minimum two

2350
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,520
there's many kind of classic quotes of

2351
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,040
synergetics which is developed

2352
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,199
primarily by buckminster fuller no

2353
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,880
longer here physically

2354
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,080
and uh it really reminds

2355
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,639
one that the basis of this way of

2356
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,320
thinking is relational

2357
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,679
so that relational stance which is

2358
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,440
shared with active inference at a very

2359
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,560
kernel level

2360
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,480
is going to be implemented in a couple

2361
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,600
of different ways

2362
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,800
so in synergetics the key pillars are

2363
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,600
related to

2364
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,600
the areas that we would consider

2365
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,199
geometry topology

2366
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,000
or graph theory or network science it's

2367
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,800
also related to

2368
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,199
vectors and dynamic systems as well as

2369
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,400
structural modeling

2370
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,840
which was developed by buckminster

2371
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,239
fuller through the engineering practice

2372
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:56,560
of

2373
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,440
tensegrity tensegrity modeling but

2374
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,639
there's a few other

2375
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,639
interesting and important pieces of

2376
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,000
synergetics

2377
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and one of them is that the tetrahedra

2378
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,679
is the minimal system

2379
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,040
not the cube and the tetrahedral

2380
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,360
uh focus pervades several different

2381
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,040
domains one of them is that there's a

2382
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:15,840
focus

2383
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,320
on the 60 degree angle as being primary

2384
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,000
rather than the 90 degree

2385
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,560
angle so the tetrahedra is the minimal

2386
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,400
system and this plays out in a million

2387
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,120
different ways but the tetrahedra on the

2388
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,600
screen

2389
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,120
relates to plato's triad and

2390
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,400
it shows on the right side this

2391
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,800
triad of the true uh the good and the

2392
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,360
beautiful truth beauty and symmetry any

2393
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,120
three you want relate them however you

2394
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,040
like and then

2395
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,360
the tetrahedral edition of the self so

2396
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,440
this is the perspective this is the

2397
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,480
relational component and

2398
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,560
quite interesting to think about some of

2399
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,400
the grand transformations that are

2400
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,199
occurring

2401
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,239
at this time in world history from

2402
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,480
the perspective of synergetics and the

2403
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,000
introduction of the self

2404
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,040
into this triad and

2405
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,360
other tetrahedra can be imagined uh

2406
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,480
crystals

2407
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,320
buildings social relationships

2408
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,480
what really makes me curious is that in

2409
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,480
active inference on the coarsest grain

2410
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:16,800
there

2411
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,199
are also four states that's that four

2412
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,239
state model

2413
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,120
and those are the two kinds of external

2414
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,400
and internal states

2415
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,560
and then the uh sense in action states

2416
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,000
so there's a unity in those x internal

2417
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,440
and external states that's unity is

2418
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,000
plural

2419
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,639
at minimum two internal and external and

2420
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:37,120
then

2421
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,719
there's the interface and then the next

2422
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,159
level out is four not

2423
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,320
three the interface is not one part the

2424
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,679
interface is two parts

2425
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,440
so you go from unity as plural and at

2426
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,080
minimum two internal and external states

2427
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,040
to the triangle which is stable but as a

2428
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,639
modeling concept but

2429
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,880
doesn't have space enclosure it's not a

2430
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,000
minimal system

2431
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,639
the minimal real specified system is the

2432
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,639
tetrahedron is the four state active

2433
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:01,520
inference

2434
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,159
model so from a totally different

2435
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,040
perspective

2436
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,040
non-geometric perspective but

2437
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,080
intriguingly using information geometry

2438
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,480
fvp free energy principle has converged

2439
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,360
to somewhat of a synergetic perspective

2440
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,520
on how unity is plural and how the

2441
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,840
minimal system is potentially a purely

2442
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,360
relational tetrahedra

2443
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,199
so that is quite interesting big if true

2444
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,080
also from her dissertation this figure

2445
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,280
of a tetrahedra

2446
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,600
relates how qualitative concepts can be

2447
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,400
captured

2448
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,440
within synergetics so here

2449
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,600
the edges of the tetrahedra or the

2450
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,560
vertices

2451
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,760
are vision reflected by a mission

2452
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,280
statement

2453
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,960
tools hopefully the mission statement is

2454
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,400
something that we will write together as

2455
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:46,800
a

2456
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
lab and as a community with feedback as

2457
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,920
well

2458
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,679
on the right side tools and resources

2459
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,560
that's one of our projects

2460
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,159
and hopefully the tools that we build

2461
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,840
will be for ourselves and for everybody

2462
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,120
and the resources that we make

2463
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,199
will be for everyone so that's education

2464
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,480
as well everything is tools and

2465
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,840
resources

2466
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,760
on the left side design in the action

2467
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,880
plan to be

2468
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
bringing people together successfully

2469
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,719
we're going to be needing to co-create

2470
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,080
co-design and then enact our action plan

2471
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,320
shared joint action it doesn't mean that

2472
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,080
everyone's going to do the same thing

2473
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,120
but we are going to co-create and enact

2474
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,320
together

2475
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,639
and then on the bottom evaluation and

2476
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,080
supervision

2477
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,480
and this kind of mentorship peer

2478
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,120
mentorship

2479
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,679
whatever it happens to be considered as

2480
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:32,800
or called

2481
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,080
facilitation is how we're going to

2482
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,120
make sure that this whole tetrahedra is

2483
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,599
coherent

2484
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,080
another feature of synergetics and

2485
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,000
tensegrity is this

2486
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,080
focus on both tension and compression

2487
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,000
and so the idea that bucky had

2488
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,480
was that the uh buildings on earth they

2489
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,320
require gravity to pull them down like

2490
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,600
the building i'm in if it was on its

2491
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,800
side it would just crumple

2492
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,120
from its own mass and so they require

2493
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,440
gravity in order to hold them down

2494
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,600
whereas if you're going to be shooting

2495
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,520
something to a different planet or

2496
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,840
landing it from a high altitude you need

2497
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,040
to be able to be

2498
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,199
kind of self-supporting from any

2499
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,040
gravitational influences

2500
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,920
and so these kinds of tensegrity

2501
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,960
structures

2502
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,480
are um with both compressive and tensile

2503
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,920
elements so like ropes

2504
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,400
that are connected to rods and if you

2505
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,320
just look up tensegrity sculpture or

2506
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,520
tensegrity robot

2507
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,600
you'll see a ton of cool robots and

2508
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,679
other stuff

2509
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,480
and um the big question is could we

2510
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,120
connect it

2511
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,679
with active inference and the fep and

2512
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,560
here are

2513
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,080
some people amy edmondson kirby earner

2514
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,120
kurt mcnamara the 10 second wiki

2515
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,159
snec the cj apparently all the groups

2516
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:48,800
that he does

2517
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,600
everyone else i don't know all of them

2518
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,280
these are just some that i

2519
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,480
know or have learned a ton from

2520
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,120
but there's so much that could be

2521
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,040
explored here

2522
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,520
the question that we return to just so

2523
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,719
many times

2524
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,920
in this year and we'll return to again

2525
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,040
is what does free energy principle and

2526
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,560
active inference say about the

2527
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,000
relationship between

2528
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,199
an agent and the world and

2529
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,320
that has come to be uh understood

2530
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,719
in these discussions as the relationship

2531
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:23,600
between

2532
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,280
the different parts of a multi-scale

2533
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,199
system between the psycho

2534
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,080
psychology of being in social settings

2535
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,880
uh

2536
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,600
online teams computational things that

2537
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,280
are communicating with each other

2538
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,199
all these different ways that we talked

2539
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,360
about how the agent and the world

2540
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,960
interact in all the different systems

2541
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,560
that we would want to

2542
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,440
understand what this means in i mean

2543
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,239
it's a general crush question and

2544
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,120
let's continue to think about these big

2545
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,239
attractor set

2546
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,320
questions that will help us just always

2547
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,639
come back to the basics and always focus

2548
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,800
on making it the most applicable

2549
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,159
most comprehensible and just to combine

2550
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,040
that clock

2551
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,480
in the clock striking midnight with

2552
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,320
active 12.0

2553
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,520
and the kairos so the uh

2554
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,679
greek language has these two words for

2555
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:14,400
time

2556
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,960
related to time kronos being the

2557
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,080
chronometer

2558
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,400
being the time that's broken down into

2559
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,320
quantifiable pieces

2560
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,120
uh even taken to the extreme of metric

2561
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:25,679
time

2562
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,840
by some you know 10 hours per day 10

2563
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,400
minutes per hour 10 seconds per minute

2564
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,920
and then in contrast there's this kairos

2565
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,159
and these two um frameworks for time are

2566
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:38,880
so

2567
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,520
related but they're related in this way

2568
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,080
that

2569
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,400
syntax and semantics are kind of that

2570
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,440
scaffolding

2571
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,800
and meaning are and it's not a formal

2572
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,600
mapping as always these are just hastily

2573
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,719
prepared

2574
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,080
discussions just some thoughts but um

2575
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,719
as we build active inference in the

2576
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,159
computational

2577
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,960
direction and implementational with

2578
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,639
internet structures

2579
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:07,360
uh and also build in the accessibility

2580
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,159
dimension

2581
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,639
and the communication and the education

2582
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,800
and cross-disciplinary thinking

2583
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,600
as brought up by the great community

2584
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,800
feedback and so many

2585
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,639
other people we we never um

2586
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,440
want to stray away from the meaning

2587
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,560
discussions

2588
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,560
and that is uh something we'll learn

2589
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,960
along the way how it plays out but i'm

2590
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,760
just curious

2591
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,800
how that will play out so i can suffice

2592
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,360
to say

2593
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,880
that and

2594
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,679
wow i mean i don't have anything

2595
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,040
prepared

2596
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,040
from a writing perspective not going to

2597
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,800
add any more

2598
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,920
any notes just 20 20 was a big year

2599
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,280
and a lot remains to be said

2600
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,400
and i hope that everybody can

2601
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,760
have a safe and healthy life

2602
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,639
and i just want to keep this about

2603
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:04,719
active inference so i really

2604
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,840
just don't

2605
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:11,440
want to uh predict or

2606
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,000
review it just feels like a time that

2607
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,679
we're all moving through in a really

2608
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,360
unique way so i just hope everyone's

2609
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,600
well and just

2610
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,239
may the gradient descent be with us all

2611
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:23,600
and one

2612
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,639
also last know on 2020 is um

2613
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,199
during this year my colleague martin

2614
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,639
passed away

2615
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:33,679
he's here and um

2616
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,719
he was an incredible person

2617
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,760
and he co-founded this group alias that

2618
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,280
i'm a part of

2619
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,719
which is a research group on

2620
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,320
consciousness and he

2621
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,760
was a co-editor on this book

2622
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,760
metacognitive diversity

2623
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,080
he was a french scholar did a lot of

2624
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,280
field work in

2625
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,719
the amazon and other areas and

2626
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,400
um in 2018 in the alias bulletin

2627
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,600
we uh martin and i interviewed carl

2628
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,800
fristen

2629
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:07,360
about free energy principle and uh

2630
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,360
so martin was really even though his

2631
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,840
background was in

2632
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,440
humanities and

2633
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,960
anthropology he learned so much about

2634
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,840
neuroscience

2635
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
and multi-scale biology and the free

2636
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,880
energy principle

2637
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,480
and just made it come alive and was such

2638
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:29,678
a cognizant thinker so

2639
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,320
all right thanks for participating

2640
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,199
everyone

2641
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:42,800
it was a uh good stream yeah

2642
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,719
r.i.p martin sorry everyone but it was a

2643
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,760
loss so

2644
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,560
uh yeah just

2645
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,600
intense stuff everybody lost people you

2646
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,360
know so

2647
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,960
anyways good times everyone thanks for

2648
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,080
being along for the ride and uh i i

2649
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:06,800
think that

2650
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,000
we'll have a lot to do and work on

2651
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,920
in 2021 i uh

2652
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,800
hope we can build from what's happening

2653
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,360
now

2654
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,280
and build towards something that's just

2655
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,360
better i know there's a better way

2656
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,880
and it's going to be really important

2657
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,040
that we get there and find it

2658
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,159
together so

2659
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,440
thanks again just stay in touch

2660
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,280
get involved r.i.p martin

2661
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,840
long live active inference peace

2662
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,840
everyone
