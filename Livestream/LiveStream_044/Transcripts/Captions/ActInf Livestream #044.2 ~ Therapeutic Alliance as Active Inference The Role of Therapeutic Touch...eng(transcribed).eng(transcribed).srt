00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,120
lab live stream number 44.2

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
and it's may 25th 2022.

5
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
welcome to the academ lab

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
we're a participatory online lab that is

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,440
applied active inference

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
you can find us at the links on this

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,920
slide

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
this is recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
stream so please provide feedback so we

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
can improve our work

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
welcome and we'll be following video

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
etiquette for live streams

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
if you want to learn more about the live

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,360

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,000
okay today in 44.2 we are in our third

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
discussion around the paper

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
therapeutic alliance as octave inference

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
the role of therapeutic touch and

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,320
synchrony from 2022 by the authors

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
listed here and ian and i had a dot zero

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
where we contextualized and went over

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
some of the outline of the paper then we

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
had a great discussion last week with

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,159
several of the authors in the dot one

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
and today we're here with some of the

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
authors and we'll see who else joins

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
and we'll be continuing that discussion

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
around the paper we left a few threads

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
but also we can just take it wherever

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
people would like to go

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
and we'll begin just by

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
saying hello people can

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
say anything they want and

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
how is this week different than last

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,719
week

42
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
how are we approaching this paper

43
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
differently or what would we like to

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
resolve or

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,360
address in this dot two that

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
was

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
stimulated by the dot one or that we

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
didn't get to in the dot one feel free

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
to add anything in that area

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
so

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,599
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,120
california

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,959
and

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
one piece in the dot 2 that i'd like to

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
explore would be

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
what are the entities

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
that we're discussing here

58
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,879
at what scales and how to think about

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
that in terms of their generative model

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
and so on

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,680
and i'll pass to ian

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,440
hello um

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
thank you daniel and

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
yes i

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
would like to maybe

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,920
pick up on if we've got time on the

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,800
topic of synchrony um this week and you

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
know what types of synchrony might be

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
we'd be talking about what things might

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
be

71
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
oscillating that come into sort of

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
phase lock between uh two two agents

73
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,360
that uh

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
have the potential to synchronize um

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
and then where do they head where do

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
they head towards with their synchrony

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
um

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
and then if we've got time you know

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
thinking about

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
tying this all back to the some of the

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
sort of core

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,680
uh

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
ideas about minimizing free energy and

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
what what does that mean for for in a

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
therapeutic setting

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,879
um

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,080
yes that's it i think thank you

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
awesome

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,799
all right any of the authors feel free

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
to go for it

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,119
zoe play these first

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,519
okay so uh i'm george uh i'm one of the

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,080
authors on this paper i'm an osteopath

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,640
and uh researcher and um where

95
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
you know where do i see this going

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
forward i pretty much enjoyed the

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
interaction we had last week and uh very

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,160
happy to

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
to kind of be left by by you guys ian

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,519
and daniel and anybody else that

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
want to join i think we can definitely

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,280
explore

103
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,199
those ideas about you know the

104
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,639
synchronization two agents uh and

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
arguably more than two agents when we

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
operate in a kind of not in a in a

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,320
dyadic

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
setting but actually a triadic setting

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
for example

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,240
uh pediatric care kind of elderly care

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,919
and so on we actually do

112
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,280
there's an act

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
an additional agent in in in the whole

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,520
thing so

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
what do i you know look forward to the

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
discussion um

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,759
kind of you know stimulate some ideas

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,840
about you know ways in which we can move

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
forward with this to the more empirical

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
uh states of the research

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
great zoe

122
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,840
i i'm zoe um i'm an osteopath as well

123
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
based in singapore and i'm the primary

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
author for this paper

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
um yeah happy to be led by anyone that

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
wants to where we want to go but

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
definitely happy to talk about synchrony

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
i think as george said it would be

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
important to talk about not just dyadic

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,160
but triadic or otherwise um

131
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
because i think that

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
adds a lot of um

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
depth to it but also it's easier to sort

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,199
of

135
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
discuss the effects of synchrony and

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,919
also the fact that you can be

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,039
okay lost zoe for a second

138
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,120
um

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
um anyone that wants to ask questions

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
okay also so is there like any other

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,639
microphone to use or could you speak

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,600
closer to the microphone

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
button i'm just using my laptop so that

144
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
isn't really a microphone i can take my

145
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
headphones off if that makes a

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,319
difference

147
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,919
it's fine it's just a little quiet but

148
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
it's fine

149
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
but

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,960
okay sorry oh no it's all it's totally

151
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
okay just want us to check okay

152
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,360
all right let us um

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
pick up with the

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
synchrony then

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
so i guess just to kind of

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
recall

157
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,840
how was this question of synchrony

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
approached in

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
the active inference literature

160
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
and maybe even outside of the active

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
inference literature and then how was

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
synchrony approached in this paper

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
like why was that such a core topic in

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
this

165
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
approach that

166
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
the authors took

167
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,560
um i think we started with synchrony

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
as the main part mainly

169
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
because when we were talking about the

170
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,080
therapeutic alliance um synchrony and

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
getting on with the other person is kind

172
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
of key and the way that we approach this

173
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
paper primarily in terms of a lot of the

174
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
aspects of how we achieve that good

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
therapeutic alliance was through

176
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,039
synchrony so that's kind of where we

177
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
um that's one of the reasons

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,039
through active inference

179
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,520
it was also

180
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
about we started i started the research

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
when i was looking at it right from

182
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
sort of the start and

183
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
looking at how

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,319
communication worked and how why people

185
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
would want to sort of synchronize

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
together and why people

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,720
to implement active inference into sort

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
of the structure that we had

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
it was important to kind of see why

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
that would be beneficial because we

191
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
wanted to use or

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,560
we like to say that the synchrony

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,520
enables us to work together to then

194
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,560
therefore um save free energy be more

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
efficient and then

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
that's how we kind of

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
we we very much used it to apply the

198
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
this active influence

199
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
sort of framework around

200
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
around it um and so

201
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
i felt that it was very key

202
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
without the synchrony element it would

203
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,199
be very

204
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,520
it was kind of the backbone into which a

205
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
lot of the effects of um active

206
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
influence in the way that we achieve

207
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
therapeutic alliance seem to sort of

208
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
center around without that connection

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
between different people

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
um we wouldn't be we wouldn't be able to

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
be to save energy to work together to

212
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
have a better relationship with our

213
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
practitioners we wouldn't um with the

214
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
patients and practitioners we would be

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
able to get the

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,279
clinical applications and benefits from

217
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,000
it

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,720
so

219
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
i saw synchrony as sort of the key

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,399
to sort of get to where the

221
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
sort of paper was so it was sort of a

222
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,320
key concept um

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
to use in order to implement it all

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
together

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
uh george

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
um

227
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,519
yeah um

228
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
but so when we when we started the

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
project actually um

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
kind of putting some ideas along the

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,760
lines um of how could we apply

232
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
predictive processing and the free

233
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
energy active inference within

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
australia and within the the osteopathic

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
setting

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,959
um

237
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,920
synchrony came along actually after um

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,279
the super

239
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
initial discussion with carl frist and

240
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
that

241
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
kind of suggested this it's actually

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
you know look into this stuff because it

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
actually could be

244
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
quite a robust way of of you know of

245
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
understanding uh

246
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
what goes on in the in in the clinic

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
room uh when two people are working

248
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,120
together with a specific kind of aim

249
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
there is a little bit of literature

250
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,399
in psychotherapy

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
kind of demonstrating that actually the

252
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
therapeutic alliance

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
becomes

254
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
much more robust uh when two people

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
synchronize

256
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
and

257
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
both at the kind of um

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,240
you know behavioral but also

259
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,120
well

260
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,839
biological level and

261
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,760
and it was nothing about sort of okay

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
you know this is about pure verbal

263
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
communication non-verbal but

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
primarily by kind of copying body

265
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
movements and so on um to think okay you

266
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
know how can this be applied in the

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
context of actually uh

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
an approach that is largely hands-on

269
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
based you know the manual

270
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,320
therapy so that's where it kind of

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,720
started from it was one way of

272
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
of trying like like zoe said kind of

273
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
looking at through patrick alliance

274
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
when people interact um

275
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
to try and understand what goes on in

276
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
the dyadic setting

277
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
kind of two people but also a little bit

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
beyond that you know it kind of what

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
happens when there's actually more

280
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
people involved in that therapeutic

281
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
relationship that need to be consulted

282
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
need to be involved in the process and

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
so on and so

284
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
that's that was the kind of early stage

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
and

286
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
yeah and then we we thought that

287
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
actually this is a good way of of of

288
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
understanding

289
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,640
um

290
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
a little bit more about how we can

291
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
create the conditions of developing a

292
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
strong kind of a

293
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,839
ecological niche that is based on that

294
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
synchrony of that sort of understanding

295
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,720
of that

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,800
give and take like a little bit like we

297
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
talked about last week the kind of the

298
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
bird song you know

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
people taking turns kind of

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
understanding listening okay

301
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
acting kind of taking on go back and so

302
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,240
on and that's sort of in a sense like

303
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
a kind of a a nice wave that goes back

304
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
and forth but it is a kind of very nice

305
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
and tranquil kind of a wave

306
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
another one that just crashes and

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
destroys everything but actually one way

308
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
you know one step kind of goes on

309
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
a little bit like the pendulum kind of

310
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,000
uh

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
analogy once you introduce that nice

312
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
pendulum kind of things

313
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
happen

314
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
that's where we sort of thought you know

315
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,800
it

316
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
could be one way of exploring the

317
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
the whole process of care

318
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,800
thank you ian

319
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
thank you so um

320
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
yeah you know i'm fascinated by the the

321
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
topic of synchrony and

322
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
the the little bits i've read in the

323
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,440
literature about how

324
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
um you know measurable things that might

325
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,040
be able to synchronize between one or

326
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
two or more people so you know daniel i

327
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
think we discussed this in the dot zero

328
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,839
so

329
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,560
um

330
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
choirs singing together

331
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
they have been shown their their their

332
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
hearts rates kind of synchronize with

333
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
their breathing

334
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
um

335
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
and

336
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
i think in the paper there was some

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
records are cited for similar sort of

338
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
stuff in drama group drumming circles

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
for example so so that really interests

340
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
me and i can kind of begin to see how

341
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
in a therapeutic setting that kind of

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,720
synchrony could lead someone um who's

343
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
maybe stressed and anxious into a kind

344
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,600
of more

345
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,560
um

346
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,839
healthy

347
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
uh increase their parasympathetic

348
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,519
activity and

349
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
that is conducive to healing um

350
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
then but i've also got these other sort

351
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,480
of nagging things about synchrony as

352
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
well

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,120
that uh

354
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
um maybe i touched on in in the you know

355
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,040
the the dot

356
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,880
zero which is what are we synchronizing

357
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,519
towards and is it always you know

358
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,519
um

359
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
beneficial so you know

360
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
this this kind of

361
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,519
the

362
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,600
less kind of lockstep synchrony that you

363
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
talked about daniel um

364
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
so maybe it's just um

365
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,040
you know let's say a child saying mummy

366
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,560
mommy mommy waving their arms around and

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
then the mum synchronize they

368
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
synchronize their attention together so

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
you get mother and child and then

370
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
then you've got a choice so there's some

371
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,920
aspect that's synchronized you know that

372
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
i think in the paper it talks about the

373
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
arms and you know the limbs and the the

374
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
voice kind of synchronizing but you know

375
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,600
and the facial expressions but um

376
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
you know a caregiver might then

377
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
lead the child to a soothing kind of

378
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,519
parasympathetic

379
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
way soothe it or it might say you know

380
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
give it a clip behind the air and say

381
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
you know children has to be seen and not

382
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
heard and

383
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
try and stop the attention you know the

384
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
attention is synchronized but the

385
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,360
the um

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
the action

387
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
may not be therapeutic so

388
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,760
um

389
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,480
yeah i'm just sort of thinking about

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,600
where

391
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
you know where

392
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
just because something's synchronized

393
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
does it mean it's always minimizing

394
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,839
free energy or just because

395
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,760
it's uh

396
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
you know things in the therapeutic world

397
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
go in and out of fashion so

398
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
frontal lobotomy is okay we don't do

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
that anymore but that for a while there

400
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
was some kind of synchronized thinking

401
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
in the therapeutic world that that's a

402
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
good idea for people and

403
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
you know i

404
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
there are ideas that i hear

405
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,120
in the wider kind of therapy world that

406
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
are fashionable

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
but um and they're being applied um but

408
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
you know they

409
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
in 50 years time

410
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
we may look that they may have been

411
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
leading people away from minimizing free

412
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,160
energy or men or improving health so

413
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
um yeah

414
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,880
they're my thoughts

415
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
okay awesome yeah a lot there george

416
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
um

417
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,880
i think the interesting thing you know

418
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
is

419
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
there are nagging questions there for

420
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
sure um

421
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,959
the first one do we always synchronize

422
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,720
and uh you know when if you don't

423
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
synchronize what we're gonna do

424
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
because you know clearly there are cases

425
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,600
where

426
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
we know the therapeutic relationship is

427
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
going nowhere okay

428
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,839
we can say whatever you know we can try

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,959
our best but actually

430
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,040
there is resistance to change from the

431
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
patients we

432
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
end up not understanding each other

433
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
and uh you know arguably that's a

434
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,079
relationship that will not evolve

435
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,399
and well you might even get to a point

436
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
at the end you know maybe the good idea

437
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
to go and see a colleague of mine kind

438
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,639
of thing okay

439
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,519
so

440
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
do we synchronize with everybody no

441
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
clearly not

442
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
is there any value understanding this

443
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
stuff by sometimes understanding there's

444
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,160
some kind of

445
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
gestures and sort of body language and

446
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,880
so on um

447
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
voice sound sort of communication style

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
we're probably uh giving us cues to

449
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
maybe to adapt a little bit

450
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
so to try and synchronize a little bit

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,839
better i think that that's useful i

452
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
think important

453
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,919
in order to be a good communicator i

454
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,799
think

455
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,679
first and foremost you know sometimes

456
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
people worry too much about the

457
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
technical skills and the ability of

458
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
doing x and y and doing some some

459
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
miracles and so on arguably you know

460
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
what the first thing that people need to

461
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
be in a clinical setting is a good

462
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
communicator

463
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
and a pretty good nice person okay and i

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
think you know if that's if that's there

465
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,440
i think

466
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
we we've got we create the conditions

467
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
and good communicators likely to

468
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
to have potentially better outcomes that

469
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,600
guys that

470
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
basically don't care and sort of they're

471
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
the experts and so on

472
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
the other question is you know is it

473
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
always about minimizing free energy

474
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
because you know there are situations

475
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
um

476
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,200
where probably you know you want to

477
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
short circuit the whole thing isn't it

478
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
you want to sort of flatten a little bit

479
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
of that sort of sensory states you know

480
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
you want to create

481
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
a condition where and the only way you

482
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
can you can

483
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
you can sort of uh

484
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,760
change the generative model is actually

485
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
by creating a massive surprise

486
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,880
a massive prediction error that

487
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
arguably surprises the system in a way

488
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,679
like wow what just happened you know

489
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,000
and actually oh okay

490
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so it's i don't think it's always about

491
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
minimizing free energy as is not

492
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
but sometimes i think you know you want

493
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
to shock the whole thing because the

494
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
system on the other side wants to

495
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,919
minimize free energy for sure

496
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
you know if you mine

497
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
if i'm a kind of chronic pain patient

498
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,640
and i you know i'm scared of moving and

499
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
you tell me to move and so on the

500
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
reaction is you know i anticipate the

501
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,679
the likelihood of movement leading to

502
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,080
pain i anticipate the consequences of

503
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
actions in the future the typical active

504
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,679
inference

505
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
model and you know lock i don't move so

506
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
i probably want to short circuit the

507
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
whole thing just to create a condition

508
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
where you know it's actually okay to

509
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
move

510
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
because it's not going to cause any harm

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
and so

512
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,559
is it through synchrony

513
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,760
um

514
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
maybe it isn't okay

515
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
so i think i i think that's not a sort

516
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
of i think um

517
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,760
a kind of one-size-fits-all kind of

518
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
thing uh and i don't think you know it's

519
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
just about sort of always that

520
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
minimizing free energy because i think

521
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
creating change that is meaningful

522
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,679
change

523
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
uh probably needs a little bit more of

524
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
he needs to

525
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
he needs to destroy that sort of strong

526
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,400
fire kind of thing so i can

527
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
implant another chip kind of thing yeah

528
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,520
in a metaphorical way

529
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,919
and that's why we know in in some

530
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,080
mental health conditions why some types

531
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
of of drugs like ketamine and so on

532
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
create that condition you know that

533
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
you know

534
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
sort of zeros the whole thing is a bit

535
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,679
like you know you reset the button isn't

536
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
it the computer is stuck what you do

537
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,159
you've tried everything you unplug the

538
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,000
computer and then you try again the

539
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
whole thing reboots isn't it so i think

540
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
sometimes that's the that's the analogy

541
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
of what maybe what we want to

542
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,720
achieve in the setting is it through

543
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,159
synchrony

544
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,720
i personally i i don't know and i'm not

545
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,159
entirely sure

546
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,440
i think if you

547
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
of course if the people started

548
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
understanding each other then that

549
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,039
creates the conditions for this thing

550
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,520
probably to happen because if i if you

551
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
don't understand me as a practitioner i

552
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
don't understand you as a patient it's

553
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,200
pretty hard that actually i

554
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
i create the conditions to change so

555
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
maybe it's through synchrony but again

556
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,360
you know

557
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,559
as a sort of big question marks really

558
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,799
so

559
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
thanks so just yes zoe please

560
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,559
yeah so i think um going off what george

561
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,679
said yes i think i mean overall the goal

562
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,159
would be to minimize free energy but to

563
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,039
it

564
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,880
to be able to do that you have to sort

565
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,840
of

566
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,919
at some point challenge it right you're

567
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,480
not gonna have the same belief that you

568
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,320
think is the most efficient

569
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
when you're born to when you die

570
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
the way that you become

571
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
used like reduce

572
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
energy is going to change over time

573
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
you'll see that especially in sort of

574
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,200
pediatrics you see it in sports um

575
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
there's a lot of studies with running

576
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,280
for example that show that the more you

577
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,000
run the more often the more mileage that

578
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
people do when they run the more

579
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
efficient they get so

580
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
i think free energy is

581
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
yes we all want to reduce it but at some

582
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,039
point we've got to update it and

583
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,880
challenge it right so

584
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
it won't be sort of just this linear

585
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
thing where you're constantly just

586
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
changing it you've got to update it and

587
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
challenge it at some point so it will

588
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
sort of be a little bit of a

589
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
a roller coaster and have a few dips

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
where you've got to take that risk

591
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
to see if there's another way that is

592
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,440
more efficient and that will save it

593
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
more um

594
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
whether synchrony

595
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
is always necessary i'm not sure i think

596
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
i definitely think

597
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,960
that

598
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,320
when you're unsure whether

599
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
or if your

600
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,200
prior is not so precise and you're not

601
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,679
100 sure that that is the

602
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,760
best way to do whatever you're doing or

603
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,720
you're not 100 certain that your belief

604
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,760
is

605
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,440
explains what's going on then i think

606
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
you're more likely to synchronize with

607
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
others i think

608
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
you

609
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
once you're quite certain on what you

610
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
think and what you're going to do then

611
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
it's a lot harder to

612
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,919
synchronize like with the cognitive sort

613
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
of immunity when you've got chronic pain

614
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
it's a lot harder to change that

615
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,720
because you're convinced that you're

616
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,520
you're right you've had this pain for

617
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
years maybe and you know what it's like

618
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,400
if you

619
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
bend forward it's gonna hurt so why

620
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
would you bother to challenge that um

621
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,760
it's i think

622
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
yeah i think there's a lot of studies

623
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
that show that especially with sort of

624
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,159
babies that they synchronize with their

625
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,480
as they once they when they're younger

626
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,440
the synchrony is is very consistent

627
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
um obviously they need to to work with

628
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
their caregiver to get their

629
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
static needs and everything that they

630
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
need to keep surviving but

631
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
it shows that they do still think when

632
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
they're adults but the time when they're

633
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
older or in adulthood that they do think

634
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,279
is when they're unsure with when you

635
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,279
know something happens and you are near

636
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
that caregiver and you you don't you

637
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
don't know you still sort of

638
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,799
rely on on them say i don't know you get

639
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,360
into a car accident or something um and

640
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
there's a big shock and you're not sure

641
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
you often the child will still no matter

642
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,000
how old they are will look to the to the

643
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
parent um

644
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,159
obviously unless the the parent is very

645
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
elderly but generally speaking in times

646
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
of uncertainty you will look towards

647
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
someone else

648
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,320
um so i think

649
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
it's equally always necessary you know

650
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
but i think if you're

651
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
not 100 certain with your priors and you

652
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
are questioning it or there is a doubt

653
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,840
of that questioning it then i think

654
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,600
synchrony will play more of a role

655
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120
in it

656
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,679
and i'll talk about that

657
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,400
awesome thanks yeah just thinking about

658
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
beliefs in the

659
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
way that we might talk about them

660
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
hey blue welcome just the way that we

661
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
might conversationally talk about

662
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
beliefs

663
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
if somebody is unsure about something

664
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,679
that's when they look to be synchronized

665
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,240
by some other informational resource i'm

666
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
not sure what time this thing opens so

667
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,159
i'm going to look it up in this way or

668
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,080
i'm going to ask this person or i'm not

669
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
sure where to go so i'm going to follow

670
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
the crowd we see that kind of in the ant

671
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
pheromone trail we see that in the

672
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
social media

673
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,799
all these different areas and then

674
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,679
conversely when somebody does have a

675
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
more confident

676
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,360
more built up prior

677
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,320
then

678
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
that's more like going their own way and

679
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,240
potentially

680
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
being more resistant to

681
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
external contrasting information and

682
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,320
then translating from that one

683
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
conversational meaning of belief like i

684
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,400
believe that is going to open at this

685
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,279
time

686
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,480
into

687
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
a broader bayesian perspective

688
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,400
on bayesian brain and body and like

689
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
thinking about pain and perception

690
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,679
as also

691
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,400
parameters that are can be seen as

692
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
as beliefs

693
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,320
in this bayesian sense so not always

694
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,279
like a psychological experienced belief

695
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,840
but in some statistical way it's like

696
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,559
they're held stances

697
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,520
that are updated in some way or

698
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,080
partially or completely by certain kinds

699
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,559
of incoming information so

700
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,240
ian and then also like this is going to

701
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,919
be i think very

702
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,279
interesting to

703
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,840
return to the free energy minimization

704
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,679
and unpack like what we mean by free

705
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
energy there so ian go for it

706
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
uh thanks so um

707
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,880
yeah i'm just sort of wanting to check

708
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,640
that um

709
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
some of the language used in other

710
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,640
realms of uh therapy so this idea of

711
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,240
self-regulation and co-regulation

712
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
um are we are we saying here that this

713
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,559
um synchrony

714
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
for in therapeutic reliance is a form of

715
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,360
co-regulation um

716
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
that that we hear a lot about in uh

717
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,120
you know people um with disorder

718
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,799
um

719
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,159
problems with their autonomic nervous

720
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
system and then we say we you go to a

721
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
therapist to help co-regulate your

722
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,279
autonomic nervous system is that what

723
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,679
we're saying is synchrony is the kind of

724
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,120
mechanism

725
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,799
for co-regulation

726
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,760
which

727
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,480
i believe fits with what you're saying

728
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
zoe that children need that more and as

729
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,080
adults we might do that occasionally

730
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,159
and um then i'm just thinking also you

731
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,799
know other forms of therapeutic

732
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,799
synchrony and co-regulation so meeting

733
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
friends for a coffee

734
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
uh sometimes

735
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
um

736
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
you know i might be having a bit of a

737
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
stressful week or

738
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,159
or a uh

739
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,320
a wobble in some way and then i meet

740
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,279
some friends and we kind of uh

741
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,080
um seek counselling each other have a

742
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
synchronize our

743
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
movement of our hands to our mouth with

744
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,480
a coffee cup or listen to some music

745
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
together tap our feet together and

746
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
that's a kind of um

747
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,480
therapeutic so are we all kind of

748
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,559
doing this on and off all the time um

749
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,399
they're my thoughts or questions

750
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,360
yes george

751
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,080
zoe then george

752
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
um yeah no i just wanted to say yes with

753
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,240
the

754
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,919
co-regulation i think that we kind of

755
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,799
not always but i think we do add an

756
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,600
element to try and suggest that um we'd

757
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,559
like to say that we in part help

758
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,799
co-regulation and co

759
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,520
we as a as a practitioner to achieve

760
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,880
sort of recovery and and reduce pain and

761
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
um and how we

762
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
i think we all want to say that we help

763
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
in that process and that we help

764
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
regulate their sort of destructive

765
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
pattern whether that's inflammation

766
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
whether that's pain

767
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
um whatever sort of metrics that you

768
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
want to

769
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
um

770
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,679
rate your your treatment by or whatever

771
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,039
your treatment goals are that you're

772
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,720
sort of working towards i think we all

773
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
want to say that we sort of

774
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
help

775
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
regulate what um

776
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,679
which ways we regulate in terms of where

777
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,840
there are sort

778
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,679
of um we actually change that their

779
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,039
heart rate or

780
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,039
um things like that we haven't got sort

781
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,159
of

782
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,200
we're not always so specific about or we

783
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
don't have the research to kind of show

784
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
that but we

785
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,279
i think certainly there is elements of

786
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,120
sympathetic and parasympathetic things

787
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,039
that that we do

788
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
as well as sort of the intent to

789
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,799
co-regulate even if we

790
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
don't sort of empirically do it

791
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,000
um or achieve it whether just that

792
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,720
reassurance that we're attempting to

793
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,600
help

794
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,279
um regulate their their pain um

795
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,240
i think is sort of the intention that i

796
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,679
hope that as a practitioner i am giving

797
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,399
off to my my patients and i'll let

798
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,520
george speak

799
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
um

800
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,279
i think you know um

801
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,919
if we see you know if you come from a

802
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,080
a manual therapy background a touch

803
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,240
based hands-on approach

804
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,360
uh one could argue or old-school kind of

805
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
beliefs in the profession christine

806
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
osteopathy would would argue that

807
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,799
actually

808
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,799
how you achieve that core

809
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,679
co-regulation um you know autonomic

810
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,039
nervous system synchronic

811
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
parasympathetic is primarily through the

812
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,279
use of techniques you know you use a

813
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
technique in a particular part of the

814
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,200
body and this affects

815
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
uh you know the parasympathetic part and

816
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,559
so on okay the vagus nerve and all that

817
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,559
stuff that that sort of

818
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,520
implies there is a tool that by which

819
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
you can apply that stuff treat that

820
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
particular bit and buy miracle you know

821
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,120
modulate everything

822
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
um i used to be there no longer there

823
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,159
because you know the evidence isn't

824
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,159
isn't strong enough to actually

825
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,159
support those clients

826
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,000
on the other hand if we add another

827
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,159
element which is the element in the the

828
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,440
synchrony

829
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,760
and the synchrony here goes beyond just

830
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
that sort of passive

831
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,559
uh

832
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
practitioner type of intervention into

833
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,559
something that implies communication

834
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,480
implies uh alignment you know attuning

835
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
to this to the environment and the

836
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,799
environment there is the practitioner as

837
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,519
well

838
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,600
so the other person in the room the the

839
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,399
guy that is facilitating the process so

840
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
sort of takes us i think away from

841
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,799
this idea that you know everything is

842
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,480
about touches everything about the

843
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,120
manual stuff and so on but it becomes a

844
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
kind of um a multi-pronged approach

845
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,080
where touch matters that communication

846
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,559
matters as much as touch

847
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,279
and it's not a technique x y or z but

848
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
it's actually the whole package of care

849
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
that's likely to to enable us to to get

850
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,799
there

851
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,159
so

852
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,519
you know is it similar to you know and

853
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,600
and i kind of uh you know i like your

854
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,360
analogy to sort of you know tough day

855
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
and so on you go out you need to see

856
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,039
your friends you need to synchronize in

857
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
a different environment because

858
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,760
ultimately people you know will talk

859
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,159
talk to each other and coral regulate

860
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,559
each other even in terms of reducing our

861
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,480
static load of a tough week and so on um

862
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
there are kind of things that that are

863
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
similar to what happens in the clinical

864
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,799
setting one of them we're probably

865
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,799
thinking about reward systems as well

866
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,559
you know there's a there's a sort of a

867
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,240
participation in something that is

868
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,919
likely to

869
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
even if uncomfortable is left it's going

870
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
to lead to some improvement it kind of

871
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
you know maybe

872
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,919
maybe there's some dopamine stuff there

873
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,000
maybe there is a reward pathways that

874
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,799
are

875
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,399
kind of involved in the whole thing like

876
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,559
having a drink in the same having a

877
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,039
therapeutic intervention that

878
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,039
ultimately is going to

879
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,600
get me to to a better state

880
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,480
i think it's very very analogous to

881
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,080
moving away from the free energy

882
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,039
principle and to an area that is

883
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,720
kind of uh

884
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,240
works alongside that in activism um

885
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,120
the concept of sense making you know

886
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,840
so

887
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,960
the kind of

888
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
and uh

889
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,360
what inactivists would argue participate

890
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,200
three sense making

891
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
so synchrony could be

892
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
and also looked from that from that lens

893
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
from that perspective

894
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
whereas the two people or more than two

895
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,760
people either in a group you know having

896
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
a drink and all kind of helping each

897
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,159
other because i listen and or in a

898
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,320
therapeutic setting that's sort of

899
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
participatory things making uh

900
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,840
minimizing free energy or to puyses for

901
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,120
the the kind of the inactivists and it's

902
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,200
actually i think you know we we

903
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,279
we sort of uh

904
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,200
looking at the same phenomena maybe with

905
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
different language but arguably the same

906
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
kind of phenomena so you

907
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,039
say i think it's that package that

908
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,120
probably helps core regulation rather

909
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,480
than just

910
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,279
one

911
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,760
one intervention

912
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,919
thank you

913
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,199
blue

914
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,560
welcome

915
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,918
do you want to

916
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,598
add anything or ask anything

917
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,480
uh not right off the bat just hi it's

918
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,079
nice to be here with you guys i'm sorry

919
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,679
i missed last week and i've really

920
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,440
enjoyed the discussions with the paper

921
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
so far and

922
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
um i'll jump in in a little bit i think

923
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
you guys were engrossed in a in a good

924
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,079
conversation so

925
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,000
okay awesome so the dopamine angle and a

926
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,239
few other things let's we'll return to

927
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
but we were talking about minimizing

928
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,079
free energy

929
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
and i wanted to

930
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,359
show a few images from the textbook

931
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
because even those who have seen free

932
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,599
energy come up in a lot of different

933
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,560
settings

934
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,159
sometimes returning to the basics is

935
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
a generator that helps us take it in

936
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,119
many other ways and for those who are

937
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
maybe focused more on the clinical

938
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,560
setting or have more of that background

939
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,960
this can provide a little

940
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,079
uh

941
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,520
you know other tissues around the

942
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,359
connective tissue free energy is being

943
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,920
used like a connective tissue here it's

944
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
bridging a lot of different ideas it's

945
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
helping us connect different sensory

946
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,400
modalities and therapeutic modalities

947
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
so just a few

948
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,079
cool images from the active inference

949
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,280
textbook

950
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
so here is

951
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,839
figure um 2.3

952
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,040
and it's the action perception loop

953
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,839
and the two ways that discrepancies

954
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,560
related to predictions or expectations

955
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
the two ways that discrepancies about

956
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
observations can be reduced

957
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
just qualitatively is through changing

958
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,520
belief

959
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
and changing action

960
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,320
and it's some blend of those two that

961
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,640
individual entities are engaged in in

962
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,560
this action perception loop

963
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,839
and then

964
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,839
when we're specifically talking about

965
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,200
free energy

966
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
there's some type of

967
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,599
equation

968
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
this is like a simple form of it

969
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,359
that is going to

970
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,760
make that discrepancy minimization

971
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
[Music]

972
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,119
tractable and possible to calculate

973
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,320
for

974
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,400
at least us doing statistics from

975
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,960
outside the system if not for the system

976
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,880
itself to do

977
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,880
and what is the real sort of

978
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,760
um

979
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,800
hidden goal is this minimization of true

980
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,079
surprise

981
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,040
but the minimization of true surprise

982
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,000
is intractable or it's inaccessible

983
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,839
and so free energy

984
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,480
serves as like this upper bound whereas

985
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
if we can reduce

986
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
this upper bound

987
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
we're getting implicitly closer

988
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
to this

989
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,640
asymptotic reduction of some pr of

990
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
surprise

991
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
so

992
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,839
who's doing this reduction of surprise

993
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,400
that relates to the entity

994
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
um question what is the entity that's

995
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,320
actually doing free energy minimization

996
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,079
and so

997
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,160
what are the entities that we're talking

998
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,400
about here

999
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
what

1000
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,480
does it mean to minimize free energy

1001
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
and when is it

1002
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,680
and and i i

1003
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
liked how earlier it was brought up when

1004
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
sometimes where that free energy

1005
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
minimization was going with the flow and

1006
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
then sometimes when there was a flow

1007
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,599
disrupt so what is free energy

1008
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,320
minimization and what are the entities

1009
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
and how are we modeling that ian and

1010
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,280
then anyone else

1011
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,920
thanks um yeah that question of what are

1012
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,359
the entities and um linking it back to

1013
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,960
george's point about sense making and

1014
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,640
inactivism so

1015
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
um

1016
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
in the paper there was um some really

1017
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,520
interesting stuff on um the

1018
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,000
realizing that we're all alike

1019
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,839
um

1020
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
in the therapeutic alliance and

1021
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,680
relating that back to

1022
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
sense making i'm thinking that you know

1023
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
therapeutically or meeting threat you

1024
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,119
know in a in a manual therapy or meeting

1025
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,200
friends there's you know the outcome

1026
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
might be ah

1027
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,520
i'm not a weirdo i'm not you know i'm

1028
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,880
not i haven't done anything wrong

1029
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,560
everything's okay again

1030
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,200
um i'm relaxed and

1031
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,599
that's therapeutic so you know i'm

1032
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,079
amongst people who are very much alike

1033
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,240
me um and that's the sense-making

1034
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,320
there's the pattern recognition you know

1035
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,560
i'm a valuable member of my tribe

1036
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
however you want to describe it

1037
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,160
um

1038
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,920
and then i think you know

1039
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
how

1040
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
but we're not we're never completely

1041
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,040
identical

1042
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
um or are we i don't know

1043
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,480
uh

1044
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
so

1045
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
the proposal in the paper is that that's

1046
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,160
the ultimate realization that we're all

1047
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,000
alike and i can kind of see that that's

1048
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
a kind of relieving thing to realize

1049
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,000
um

1050
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,800
but

1051
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,599
you know we're similar but we're

1052
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,480
in am i i'm similar to my pet dog in

1053
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,160
that i've got eyes and

1054
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
i breathe and my heart beats and i can

1055
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,160
synchronize in some ways with that and

1056
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,280
it feels nice but my dog can't help me

1057
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
do my accounts for example um

1058
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,920
so

1059
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
yes

1060
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,400
this this likeness and um

1061
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
how does that fit into sense making

1062
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,880
thanks blue

1063
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
so as i've been reading the textbook

1064
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
i've been um thinking a lot about the

1065
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
hidden states and it's interesting to

1066
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,160
think about that in terms of using touch

1067
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,560
to kind of resolve uncertainty about the

1068
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,079
hidden states

1069
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,640
because while a state might be hidden to

1070
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,280
the patient right when you present with

1071
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
some like i've got a pain in my shoulder

1072
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,599
or something like that um

1073
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,280
it might be easy for the therapist to

1074
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
say oh that's this this and i push here

1075
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,319
and tweak this and then it's better um

1076
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,920
but like so it might be hidden to the

1077
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
patient but not hidden to the doctor or

1078
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
hit into the doctor

1079
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,880
and the patient or hit into

1080
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,680
the

1081
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
patient but not the doctor or the doctor

1082
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
but not the patient so it might be like

1083
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,480
all of these things and so it's like

1084
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,800
working together this kind of synchrony

1085
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,720
to resolve uncertainty about about a

1086
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,480
hidden state and i've i've thought a lot

1087
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
about like who's making the observation

1088
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,119
um and who's who's doing the state

1089
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,160
observing

1090
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
uh and who is the state hidden to and

1091
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,400
and it brings back what um the paper

1092
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,240
that you guys mentioned in the dot zero

1093
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,319
the communication as active inference

1094
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,599
because it really is like a

1095
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,960
bi-directional

1096
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
um harmonious kind of thing happening

1097
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,440
right

1098
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,560
awesome

1099
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,640
thanks yes

1100
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
george

1101
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,119
um

1102
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
yeah

1103
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,599
so um actually starting with the hidden

1104
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,800
states

1105
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,760
who's observing who's been observed i

1106
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,200
think

1107
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
uh

1108
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
you know the free energy model or

1109
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,200
picture the typical representation with

1110
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,920
the two agents and or one agent in the

1111
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
world and

1112
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,079
internal states external states and so

1113
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,480
on so if you have the two agents you

1114
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
know there's something in the middle

1115
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,200
that clearly is the ground where

1116
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,560
we kind of

1117
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,640
try to achieve some form of alignment

1118
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,599
and then

1119
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,880
um

1120
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,839
that certainly implies the reading of

1121
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,680
someone else's

1122
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
internal state

1123
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,839
uh i think you know that who makes the

1124
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,160
observation who's been observed and so

1125
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,119
on i think again it is is the bird song

1126
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,040
is a given take because

1127
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,920
they are clearly situations where

1128
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
you may be telling your patient that

1129
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,920
actually is nothing to worry about

1130
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,839
for example where you're not

1131
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,280
particularly

1132
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,520
sure about what's going on and the

1133
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,599
patient can clearly read

1134
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,839
in your body language that

1135
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,560
no it's um is is hiding something from

1136
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,680
me right

1137
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
it's it's it's something there that

1138
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,520
doesn't feel right

1139
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
and and actually um

1140
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,079
there's an interesting phenomena for

1141
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,319
example with in chronic conditions um

1142
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,240
which is the concept of

1143
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,240
uh cognitive immunization where um

1144
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,560
it's very common these days for

1145
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
you know

1146
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,839
patient goes and sees a practitioner has

1147
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,000
read has consulted with dr google to

1148
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
start dr google said you know it could

1149
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,359
be x y and z typically the worst case

1150
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,839
scenario goes and sees

1151
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:48,800
uh

1152
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,520
doctor number one doctor number one says

1153
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,960
yeah you know what you know it's nothing

1154
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,880
to worry about there's nothing wrong

1155
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,200
with you depression has got pain kind of

1156
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,680
saying all right i don't trust you kind

1157
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,560
of thing

1158
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
then goes and sees partition and number

1159
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,640
two that comes with a different story

1160
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,280
and yeah okay maybe you forget about you

1161
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,720
forgotten about something goes to

1162
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,119
practitioner number three and so on and

1163
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,200
gets through a process where

1164
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,599
authors argue that it's a kind of you

1165
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,359
know

1166
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,040
the system becomes

1167
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
cognitively immune to any new

1168
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,680
explanations because

1169
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,839
the expectation is surely there's

1170
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,680
something wrong with me so clearly in

1171
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
those conditions you know if we take

1172
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,880
from this lens

1173
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,520
one could argue uh yeah as a patient i'm

1174
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,000
observing you i'm kind of reading your

1175
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,480
internal states which is i don't trust

1176
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
you kind of thing because you're

1177
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,119
actually telling me something but

1178
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,000
actually

1179
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,520
something that potentially you don't

1180
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,960
believe either okay or you know this

1181
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,319
thing about let's do cognitive

1182
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,240
reassurance because

1183
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,119
most non-specific backbone or neck pain

1184
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,680
you know one cannot say that's clearly a

1185
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,319
particular tissue responsible for

1186
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,359
the pain

1187
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,200
the symptoms and so on so you say okay

1188
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,160
you know

1189
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,680
there's nothing serious with you so

1190
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,200
what's wrong with me you know you

1191
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,040
clearly can't tell the patient oh you've

1192
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,200
got non-specific back pain because for

1193
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
the patient that means you haven't got a

1194
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,040
clue about what's wrong with me or

1195
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,800
you're implying that something upstairs

1196
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
in my head i'm making it up so

1197
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,000
patients observe us for sure and they

1198
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,440
know when we

1199
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,400
kind of are confident and so on and when

1200
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,200
we

1201
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
we're not so confident and maybe we're

1202
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,480
not entirely sure if actually the whole

1203
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
thing is going to happen in the same way

1204
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
we observe patients

1205
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,000
we

1206
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,160
we start observing them you know when

1207
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
they come through the door

1208
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
when you first greet them and so on hi

1209
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
how are you doing before kobe times you

1210
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,480
know shaking hands and so on were a

1211
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,040
pretty good first kind of getting into

1212
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
someone else's internal state

1213
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,119
because just the you know the

1214
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,520
the handshake the quality of the the

1215
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,359
amount of pressure the confidence and so

1216
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
on in a lot of you know there were cases

1217
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,839
say this person is anxious this person

1218
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,079
is down he's depressed and so on and he

1219
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,520
could get that uh down to

1220
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,359
you know when you clinic do clinical

1221
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,760
examination you touch you observe you

1222
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,720
you feel you palpate and so on so

1223
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
um

1224
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,800
that implies that there's a lot of

1225
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,040
unconscious stuff that

1226
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,000
it's

1227
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,280
you know

1228
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,960
it's process

1229
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,040
comes through arrives through our

1230
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,560
our sensory our sensorian and uh you

1231
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
know we made something

1232
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,040
out of it so i think that that's what we

1233
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,400
kind of um

1234
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,520
you know one of the things we're trying

1235
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,960
to explore

1236
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,240
through this stuff about you know

1237
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,760
try to understand someone else's

1238
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,880
internal

1239
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,040
state you know predicting a little bit

1240
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,880
of their mental state

1241
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,240
and uh

1242
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,920
and that's where synchrony and that's

1243
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
where alignment

1244
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,000
um kind of plays that important role

1245
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
because you know there's no alignment i

1246
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,319
can't clearly guess what's wrong

1247
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,040
going on um the stuff about you know

1248
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,240
what what you

1249
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,599
and what you mentioned about sense

1250
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,680
making and so on

1251
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,599
sense making is is quite an interesting

1252
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,359
thing and you said okay you know

1253
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,839
we're not like

1254
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,800
you know

1255
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,000
a patient is a patient and the

1256
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
practitioner is a practitioner you know

1257
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,839
there is that

1258
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
power differential as well you know

1259
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,920
there's the doctor there's the patient

1260
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,720
uh when one is an expert and when the

1261
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,800
other is an expert

1262
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,119
and things alternate

1263
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,280
and

1264
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
the the whole thing about sense making

1265
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
and actually minimization of free energy

1266
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
and so on since making is quite an

1267
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,720
interesting thing to

1268
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,480
when we look at some

1269
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,319
clinical conditions and there's some

1270
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,640
beautiful stuff written about for

1271
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,359
example mental health and um

1272
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,079
inactive approaches and

1273
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,400
looking at for example depression as a

1274
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,240
disorder of sense making for example uh

1275
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,200
and you see that

1276
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,359
sometimes with patients with chronic

1277
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,520
musculoskeletal problems

1278
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
that also have

1279
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,359
you know a comorbidity they have

1280
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,319
depression what came first the

1281
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,359
depression of the back or the back pain

1282
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,160
one could argue that um

1283
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,880
if i suffer from chronic back pain and i

1284
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
can't get out of the house i can't see

1285
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,079
my friends i can't walk my dog i can't

1286
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
play with my children and so on

1287
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,720
the world stops kind of making sense

1288
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,839
right

1289
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,240
you know i don't go out because outside

1290
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,319
is a is a cruel world and it's kind of

1291
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,400
full of you know

1292
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
dangers and so on so i stay in a safe

1293
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,359
environment which is my home watching

1294
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,480
telly

1295
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,720
kind of uh you know complaining about

1296
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,280
myself to myself

1297
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,240
okay

1298
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
and uh and i become depressed because

1299
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,240
i'm stuck look

1300
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,960
so

1301
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,640
um

1302
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,040
the therapeutic real you know the the

1303
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,760
therapeutic encounter that sort of uh

1304
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,079
nice ecological niche in a sense

1305
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,640
creates opportunity for sense making

1306
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,559
to to understand where there's patterns

1307
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,040
for example rigid behavior

1308
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,599
rigid thinking that actually

1309
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,400
by uh understanding by uh interacting i

1310
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,559
can potentially start sort of taking the

1311
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,960
patient in a particular direction

1312
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,119
which is the sort of you know

1313
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,000
this kind of road to recovery

1314
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,960
uh

1315
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,359
and one you know i one could argue that

1316
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,440
if someone starts feeling um

1317
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,119
kind of bettering themselves

1318
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,040
symptoms reduce a little bit can start

1319
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,520
doing a little bit more can start again

1320
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,839
engaging with the world

1321
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,599
maybe the other stuff about feeling

1322
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,359
miserable

1323
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,200
would get better as well and i think

1324
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,800
that's that's sometimes what we see in

1325
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,559
musculoskeletal care is this stuff you

1326
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,640
know we don't treat mental health

1327
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,240
conditions and i don't think we should

1328
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,680
make those claims because they're

1329
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,040
clearly

1330
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,319
you know

1331
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,079
boundaries and competences and so on but

1332
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,079
but you know the patient that has got

1333
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,559
for example a chronic musculoskeletal

1334
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,480
problem and gets better

1335
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,599
and gets an impact you know that impact

1336
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,920
changes their quality of life changes

1337
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,599
their ability to

1338
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,680
you know become an agent again because

1339
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,880
pain

1340
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,160
they lost their agency because of pain

1341
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,079
i think that's where the the kind of the

1342
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,559
beauty of this understanding this stuff

1343
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,440
kind of comes is you know you can impact

1344
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,680
on some you know on different levels of

1345
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,160
the person of the self

1346
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
that is clearly not just that

1347
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,040
in body itself that body but it's beyond

1348
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,280
that embodied itself is the sort of you

1349
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,240
know this multi-dimensional kind of um

1350
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,079
what is to be a person kind of thing

1351
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,319
right and

1352
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,000
so yeah and i think that sometimes it's

1353
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,079
about

1354
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,680
kind of reading the others the you know

1355
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,520
understanding the other guy's internal

1356
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,480
state

1357
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,240
is about sort of

1358
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,920
doing the right thing at the right time

1359
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,720
because i know there's there's a cue

1360
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,359
that tells me maybe i if i do this stuff

1361
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,200
this could be really

1362
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,559
you know one way of getting in

1363
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,480
surprising the system in a very positive

1364
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,280
way

1365
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,400
okay so

1366
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,040
i've just been participating so

1367
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,120
joey

1368
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,319
[Music]

1369
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,359
yes uh

1370
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,960
yeah i think

1371
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,319
oh gosh let me take my hand down okay

1372
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,119
yeah i think similar to what george said

1373
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,160
on sort of it's uh a bird song i think

1374
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
there's different aspects where

1375
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,280
you know

1376
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,839
yes generally on the the technical the

1377
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,400
physiology or the anatomy side then the

1378
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,960
practitioner is always obviously more

1379
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,960
the expert but i think there's certain

1380
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,040
things where maybe you're looking at a

1381
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,440
patient or you're you know still trying

1382
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,160
to examine them and

1383
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,200
the

1384
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,480
the patient is still going to be the

1385
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,800
expert in their pain and so you

1386
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,280
you might be tossing and turning between

1387
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,800
a few diagnoses say and then the patient

1388
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,680
suddenly comes up with like oh yeah by

1389
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,800
the way

1390
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
and then what you were thinking

1391
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,400
completely goes out so i think you

1392
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,000
completely read them

1393
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,440
um there's always going to be sort of

1394
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,800
hidden states that you don't know about

1395
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
and then you kind of have to you're

1396
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,319
always on the lookout in case the

1397
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,119
situation is changing or

1398
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,480
maybe they don't want to tell you

1399
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,000
exactly what it is and you're not you

1400
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,440
you think something's missing that

1401
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,319
intuition that maybe there's an element

1402
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,079
of this that you're not that you're not

1403
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,680
getting or suddenly they got worse and

1404
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,839
you're wondering well what happened like

1405
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,520
what changed what

1406
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,160
what what goes on and then you find out

1407
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,280
that you know um

1408
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
their child's been really sick or

1409
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,760
something or their work's been really

1410
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
stressful or something else has happened

1411
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,400
excluding that they haven't said that

1412
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,079
you kind of pick up on

1413
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,200
um

1414
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,800
so i think there's there's that where

1415
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,520
you kind of you're inferring what that

1416
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,040
other person

1417
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
means and there's definitely

1418
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,480
you know you're watching them they're

1419
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,680
watching you

1420
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,839
and you're kind of still you know

1421
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,000
deciding what's going to happen based on

1422
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,680
the sort of what you think is going on

1423
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,880
and

1424
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,680
and that and throughout treatment

1425
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,599
you know there's no set treatment for

1426
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,480
certain things as well like whether it's

1427
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,559
exercises or

1428
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,319
touch you

1429
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,240
have to adapt based on what you're

1430
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,680
feeling

1431
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,839
and similarly to what you

1432
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,800
um think it's the ian that brought it up

1433
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,839
um

1434
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,319
before the sort of synchrony and whether

1435
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,559
it's exact or not well

1436
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,240
it sort of also depends on the stimulus

1437
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,440
there's a lot of

1438
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
research that

1439
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,760
um there was one paper that

1440
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,680
was about a film

1441
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,040
and um

1442
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,280
they got two separate people

1443
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
to watch the same film

1444
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,640
um

1445
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,680
in by themselves at at separate times

1446
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,400
but in certain parts of the the film

1447
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,359
their heart rate was exactly the same

1448
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,240
um

1449
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
their heart rate went up when

1450
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,160
you know the fight scene happened and

1451
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,000
then their heart when it went down the

1452
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,760
same and actually you know the

1453
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,680
difference was they were in sync even

1454
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,800
though they

1455
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,680
were

1456
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,520
nowhere near each other couldn't see

1457
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,960
each other didn't know what that person

1458
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
was doing they're probably doing

1459
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
completely different things but the

1460
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,400
stimulus

1461
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,720
dictated the synchrony

1462
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,079
um so i think that's an interesting

1463
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:26,839
thing

1464
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,320
to um

1465
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,520
[Music]

1466
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,599
to consider as well that the synchrony

1467
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,960
might be from

1468
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,640
from the stimulus that's happening

1469
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,160
during the treatment whether it's touch

1470
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,920
whether it's something else but we

1471
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,079
focused on touch but

1472
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,200
yeah the

1473
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,119
whether you synchronize just based on

1474
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,240
what you're

1475
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,119
in in that moment um

1476
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,880
but actually you know it's completely

1477
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,040
different otherwise so

1478
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,000
um

1479
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,960
yeah i just wanted to point out

1480
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
thanks that that reminds me a lot of

1481
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,200
this direct

1482
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,119
interfacing

1483
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,240
mechanism of synchrony which might be

1484
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,040
via like auditory communication

1485
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,200
touch and so on and then there's this

1486
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,280
more stigmergy

1487
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,240
based

1488
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,400
niche modification

1489
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,079
construction of a niche like a corn maze

1490
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,920
where everybody walking through it is

1491
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,760
having a shared experience or like you

1492
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,280
said with two people watching the same

1493
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,079
film it's like there's some

1494
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,160
similarity in their niche

1495
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,760
and so there's

1496
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,119
um a resulting synchronization

1497
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,920
without direct interfacing because

1498
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,200
they're interacting in a shared

1499
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,400
there's something shared about their

1500
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,920
niche either two people going through

1501
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,119
the same niche at different moments

1502
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,920
patients coming through a space

1503
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,720
or there's people that are

1504
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,359
in separate physical spaces but the

1505
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,079
niche has some similarity

1506
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,520
and i'm sure there's a lot of other

1507
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,839
examples like that um

1508
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,079
ian and then i have that image up if you

1509
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,680
want to describe what you

1510
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,839
wanted to share

1511
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,520
there thanks daniel uh yeah i will we'll

1512
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,960
describe that in a moment but as uh um

1513
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,400
the conversation about films i'm just

1514
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,520
thinking that

1515
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,280
hollywood and filmmakers are actually

1516
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,680
masters of uh

1517
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,440
inducing synchrony really you know

1518
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,960
they've got the bird song so they've got

1519
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,680
the

1520
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,440
the beautiful music or the dramatic

1521
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,240
music or whatever you've got the imagery

1522
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,040
the words the the com composition of the

1523
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,680
images to hopefully not obviously not

1524
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,040
everyone will have the same experience

1525
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,839
of a film but they hope that their sad

1526
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,839
film will

1527
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,599
induce some synchrony amongst the

1528
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,000
viewers in terms of the

1529
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,319
response in their body or a happy film

1530
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,559
will induce some kind of

1531
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,720
rhythmic laughter um

1532
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,240
so uh

1533
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,880
yeah and uh i'm thinking about some work

1534
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,720
i've um

1535
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
heard of recently of uh john viveki

1536
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,119
looking at emotional goosebumps

1537
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,240
um

1538
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,440
and

1539
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,880
how this links to um

1540
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,760
he thinks it's uh the process of

1541
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,079
temperature regulation is being exacted

1542
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,680
up into um

1543
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,359
some kind of

1544
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,119
relevance

1545
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,440
things salient to us through

1546
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,240
goosebumps um

1547
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,480
and there's an opportunity there to kind

1548
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,880
of open up cognitively and explore some

1549
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,119
other ideas that maybe

1550
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,040
the person wasn't able to before and you

1551
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,319
can think okay that music gave me

1552
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,960
goosebumps and i had all these ideas um

1553
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,280
so yeah there's just a few things as we

1554
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,480
were talking there that i was thinking

1555
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,040
about but um this diagram was george as

1556
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,760
you were talking about the kind of how

1557
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,720
you know the complex things that um

1558
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,040
might be at play

1559
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,599
with in the patient this was um done by

1560
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,760
mit i only found out about it a few days

1561
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,920
ago it was 2015

1562
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,760
but all of these different factors that

1563
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,280
might lead someone into a kind of um

1564
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,520
vicious cycle of depression and you know

1565
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,760
we've got things like

1566
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,920
uh

1567
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,680
cortisol or unreg you know unbridled

1568
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,040
inflammation at the top there but then

1569
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,799
you've also got as you said george the

1570
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,200
physical inactivity and how this you've

1571
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,640
got all these different looping

1572
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,839
perception

1573
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,720
action cycles here that are

1574
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,200
creating this sort of downward spiral

1575
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,799
and you know therapeutically i guess

1576
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,160
what we're trying to do is create an

1577
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,599
upward opening

1578
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,240
trying to get an access point and you

1579
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,440
know zoe you said you might have to try

1580
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
lots of things i have to try looking

1581
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,960
trying one of these loops and if that

1582
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,040
doesn't work okay

1583
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,359
try a different loop to

1584
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,799
open up this sort of thing that's

1585
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,440
tightening and maybe open it up

1586
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,000
either physically or

1587
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,559
perceptually

1588
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,359
yeah thank you this is like very much

1589
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,720
showing that complex causation and so

1590
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,119
sometimes a disciplinary approach

1591
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,079
um might be like well hippocampal volume

1592
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,319
is associated with this change

1593
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,799
and that could absolutely be empirically

1594
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,280
true or cytokine signaling or early

1595
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,119
adverse experiences

1596
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,079
and so

1597
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,880
part of the challenge is reassembling

1598
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,839
this complex causal network

1599
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,359
and then even

1600
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,200
if there were some sort of causal

1601
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,960
network that could be reassembled

1602
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,160
then how

1603
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,599
might the

1604
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,440
failure mode

1605
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,359
be similar or different from the

1606
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,839
recovery mode like there are certain

1607
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,440
things that cannot be

1608
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,240
changed like in the past and there's

1609
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,599
other things

1610
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,240
kind of like the concept of hysteresis

1611
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,359
where

1612
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,559
we can't just

1613
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,160
reversibly modify something and so where

1614
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,119
are the leverage points in this

1615
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,640
diagram

1616
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,160
and it's yeah

1617
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,480
george

1618
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,200
um

1619
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,640
yeah it's

1620
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,880
pretty complex but yeah

1621
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,200
very good very good diagram for sure and

1622
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,480
i think you know that

1623
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,799
there's a lot of stuff that we

1624
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,400
you know we are talking about that's

1625
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,680
clearly there

1626
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,040
um

1627
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,440
i think you know where you know clearly

1628
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,040
we have

1629
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,160
you know we have modifiable and

1630
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,440
non-modifiable things you know

1631
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,280
the kind of uh there's stuff you know we

1632
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,520
can't change someone else someone else's

1633
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,160
genetics we can't change you know what

1634
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,079
happened in the past okay

1635
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,280
but they are modifiable things that's uh

1636
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
at least in uh

1637
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,839
in the context of musculoskeletal care

1638
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,799
um

1639
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,119
you know are are present you know that

1640
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,400
can include

1641
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,160
beliefs you know their prayers about you

1642
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,319
know their ideas about pain and what's

1643
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,960
wrong with them and so on down to things

1644
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,640
that uh could be lifestyle okay and

1645
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,240
and lifestyle

1646
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,880
yeah it could be more movements uh

1647
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,280
kind of changing the diet or whatever

1648
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,200
stop smoking kind of engaging in

1649
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,400
something that

1650
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,440
starts getting them kind of uh you know

1651
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
start getting the their sense making

1652
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,799
back okay

1653
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,720
um

1654
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,240
through the sense you know that the

1655
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,118
ideas that actually

1656
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,520
where uh the other the other interesting

1657
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,960
thing about this stuff you know where

1658
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,559
are the opportunities

1659
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,720
you know how can we start

1660
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,880
how can we start

1661
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,280
that process of change

1662
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,280
a very nice model

1663
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,520
typically align more with inactivist

1664
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,640
approach now sort of finding ways into

1665
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,720
pain and so on are the ecological

1666
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,799
psychology ideas about the fortune

1667
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,319
affordances

1668
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,640
you know what's outside what is out

1669
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,640
there in the environment

1670
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,480
you know already linked you know some

1671
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,000
some authors to kind of the active

1672
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,319
inference predictive processing and so

1673
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:49,680
on but

1674
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,400
clearly one can think about you know

1675
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,119
the world provides us with with the

1676
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,760
landscape of of affordances you know

1677
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,200
stuff that

1678
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,640
uh

1679
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,640
kind of uh are our opportunities for

1680
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,000
action which is basically what the

1681
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,319
description of an affordance is and one

1682
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,240
that lives in a very nice environment

1683
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,160
for example with a beautiful park and

1684
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,359
can walk you know along the coastline

1685
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,079
and uh you know stress-free environment

1686
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,280
and so on clearly that that world

1687
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,040
it's a world for a sort of you know

1688
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,119
beautiful kind of lifestyle and so on

1689
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,520
right whereas if one lives in an urban

1690
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,160
urban jungle and everybody's super

1691
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,240
stressed outside and so on arguably that

1692
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,359
landscape

1693
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,799
kind of is much

1694
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,119
much smaller and you know when we we say

1695
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,960
yeah you know would be good for you to

1696
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,040
start walking for example you know that

1697
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,640
would be a good way of start to start

1698
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,040
managing your back pain the patient can

1699
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,720
say yeah but you know when i get out of

1700
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,480
the house i'm i'm struggling i might

1701
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,000
just get

1702
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,319
run over by a car straight away

1703
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,480
the environment outside is is awful you

1704
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,319
know there's pollution everywhere you

1705
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,839
know what do you want me to do you know

1706
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,599
kind of uh

1707
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,640
yeah i i'm scared of going outside so no

1708
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,559
thank you very much because of course if

1709
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,240
you are on the other

1710
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,880
side of the of the spectrum and you can

1711
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,200
invite the person and use what's up

1712
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,280
there and start playing a little bit

1713
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,880
with those opportunities for action um

1714
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,559
i think that's

1715
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,359
those are tools that if you think

1716
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,119
sometimes you know we can start thinking

1717
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,280
very hard about what sort of exercises

1718
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,799
should the patient do

1719
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,359
should the person get engaged and so on

1720
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,000
and if we think much you know in much

1721
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,079
simpler terms and think about you know

1722
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,480
what's outside what's out there what

1723
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,319
kind of you know what kind of things are

1724
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,920
already in the environment that can be

1725
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,880
used

1726
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
to actually

1727
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,319
promote change uh you know we would be

1728
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,920
surprised that actually just the flight

1729
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,359
of stairs would be good enough you know

1730
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,839
don't take the lift take the stairs and

1731
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,359
um you know

1732
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,440
start sort of uh walking a little bit

1733
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,280
back and forth you know from home to

1734
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,359
work and so on those minimal things if

1735
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,680
the person feels like yeah okay i'll

1736
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,920
have a go and i'll try that

1737
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,640
clearly we are in a in that process of

1738
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,240
you know uh

1739
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,880
change uh kind of changing a little bit

1740
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,839
of their

1741
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,480
their sort of internal state you know

1742
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,720
maybe that prior about

1743
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,960
yeah i can't move i can't lift because

1744
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
you know it'll damage my back in fact

1745
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,079
when they

1746
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,720
start trusting their bodies um you know

1747
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,440
they can do a little bit more so

1748
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,760
there's a kind of uh it's always hard to

1749
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,839
think about okay how can i change this

1750
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,559
how can i change the the generative

1751
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,400
model and we almost think you know

1752
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,920
everything needs to be

1753
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,319
conscious cognitive and so on when in

1754
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,359
fact

1755
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,280
a lot of stuff happens unconsciously

1756
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,240
right

1757
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
you know

1758
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,400
if it was always about i'm going to

1759
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,240
think about changing and i'm going to do

1760
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,440
this and

1761
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,599
then the the world would be much simpler

1762
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,079
right but you know we you know so a lot

1763
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,400
of stuff is hidden anyway and even the

1764
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,520
person is not aware of that stuff so

1765
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,480
but

1766
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,799
so so the change the process the tools

1767
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,720
and so on i kind of

1768
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,559
this is a facet you know that goes back

1769
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,400
to that

1770
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,720
very good diagram with all these factors

1771
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,520
and i think as a practitioner yes okay i

1772
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,640
can focus entirely on the brain and the

1773
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,039
neuroscience of it and become like a

1774
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,680
brain-centric approach or i can start

1775
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,400
thinking about actually the brain is you

1776
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,200
know it's the hardware kind of stuff

1777
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,520
but there's much more in it and much

1778
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,640
more in it

1779
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,480
takes the person takes the environment

1780
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,400
takes the kind of opportunities and so

1781
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,160
on the stuff out there can be used

1782
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,118
thank you george zoe

1783
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,440
yeah just going off of what um george

1784
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,920
said in terms of um the environment

1785
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,880
around it like when you're sort of

1786
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,920
maybe if you're surrounded by nature or

1787
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,920
things like that then you might be sort

1788
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,760
of more willing or more

1789
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,559
able to change your priors i think it's

1790
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,160
also important to realize especially

1791
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,559
through touch that it's one

1792
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,280
mortality right it's one way in which

1793
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,520
we're starting to kind of try to

1794
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,839
understand and try to

1795
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,319
to manipulate the process of sort of

1796
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,799
changing those memories um whether it's

1797
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,920
the way it's

1798
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,480
processed or just having

1799
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,640
initially or just trying to adapt it and

1800
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,720
that's that touch

1801
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,480
is one way but

1802
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,760
i think also it's

1803
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,520
interesting that it's probably more

1804
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,480
likely that we may not be able to

1805
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,520
completely change that sort of

1806
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,559
uh prior but we might in that context

1807
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,039
so we might not change the fact that

1808
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,039
it's painful to bend down but we might

1809
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,319
be able to

1810
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,079
through touch and through sort of

1811
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,119
treatment

1812
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,319
get the

1813
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,359
patient to realize okay well yes maybe

1814
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,920
bending forwards is is dangerous it is

1815
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,480
it's a bad thing but

1816
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,880
if you do it in a certain way and you

1817
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,720
look at it in this way then actually

1818
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,160
it's not so bad

1819
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,520
so

1820
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,400
i think it's it's yeah it's in it it's

1821
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,079
important to take the context into it i

1822
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:08,960
think

1823
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,880
with with this i think we might be able

1824
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,480
to maybe not completely change the the

1825
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,039
maladaptive belief but with touch we can

1826
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,079
try to change it so that it's more

1827
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,559
context specific rather than a general

1828
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,400
belief that isn't able to change we

1829
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,640
might be able to change it so in certain

1830
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,680
circumstances whether it's the way we do

1831
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,440
things or just the way that we approach

1832
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,319
things we might be able to

1833
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,039
update it or modify it for that specific

1834
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,000
thing

1835
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,440
um

1836
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,440
i know the papers were talking about it

1837
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,920
in terms of like being scared of spiders

1838
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,280
you know you might still be scared of

1839
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,640
spiders but if you know that you're

1840
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,319
scared of spiders and they've got food

1841
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,280
nearby and they're despite as happy then

1842
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,760
maybe the other spider's still scary but

1843
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,599
it's not likely to kill you

1844
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,200
um or something like that in this

1845
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,119
circumstance it's not as bad as it it

1846
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,280
could be and you're going to be safe

1847
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,359
um from whatever sort of fear it is so i

1848
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,160
think

1849
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,440
that's

1850
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,359
an important thing to add on from what

1851
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,119
george was saying and i'll pause it back

1852
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,559
to george

1853
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,680
yes george and then ian

1854
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,640
uh

1855
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,880
now this is you know

1856
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,480
what's always just sense kind of uh

1857
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,559
yeah it's quite quite important and we

1858
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,680
know through touch we can clearly

1859
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,280
get in kind of

1860
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,319
effect

1861
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,920
understanding and so on

1862
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,319
um i think that that's

1863
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,119
all the positive stuff about touch

1864
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,280
there's another factor another side of

1865
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,280
the equation which i think you know as

1866
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,680
practitioners we need to be aware of

1867
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,799
which is

1868
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,400
the power of you know

1869
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,799
what's the hidden state and that touch

1870
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,480
can trigger

1871
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,440
and

1872
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,720
particularly when in trauma situations

1873
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,280
memories are embodied and when you touch

1874
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,240
someone in a particular part of the body

1875
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,680
that might again bring that unconscious

1876
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,039
stuff about for example someone has been

1877
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,079
a victim of sexual abuse for example

1878
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,160
and you could touch a person and

1879
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,440
straight away

1880
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,240
uh either there is a sort of an you know

1881
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,680
a massive

1882
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,799
response

1883
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,319
you know fight or flight you know what's

1884
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,359
going on here uh or you might actually

1885
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,679
um if it is about this sort of hidden

1886
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,719
states

1887
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,719
uh you might actually find that you know

1888
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,158
that touch kind of created a response

1889
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,479
that is almost like a no-go zone and you

1890
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,158
kind of need to be aware that sometimes

1891
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,679
you know you touch people

1892
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,679
that don't like being touched okay

1893
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,000
someone goes to a clinician that's you

1894
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,399
know in any intervention is primarily

1895
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,439
touch-based doesn't like being touched

1896
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,198
uh you might you know might go well you

1897
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,960
may synchronize extremely well you know

1898
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,880
kind of they understand you they talk

1899
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,158
when you start saying okay let's have a

1900
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,920
look that's palpate that you can feel

1901
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,719
like

1902
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,198
there's a there's a fight or flight kind

1903
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,679
of mode the person goes in straight away

1904
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,040
so i think

1905
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,759
understanding this

1906
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,920
is also quite important in understanding

1907
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,560
the limits of competence of someone

1908
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,640
you know in musculoskeletal care for

1909
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,279
example that that's an area that where

1910
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,960
probably the person needs to be referred

1911
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,040
to someone else an expert in the area

1912
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,880
maybe

1913
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,040
by getting a sense of you know this

1914
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,960
there's a response here that's not the

1915
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,799
one i would expect

1916
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,399
to perhaps

1917
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,198
not then to open the pandora box oh

1918
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,439
let's tell me a little bit about what's

1919
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,920
going on here because again you know

1920
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,000
it's a kind of you know you you probably

1921
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,799
triggered you pressed on a button

1922
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,439
that uh yeah you know keep the lid on

1923
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,279
kind of thing don't open it please

1924
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,238
because

1925
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,040
so

1926
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,600
this is important i think both both ways

1927
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,158
is it's a kind of the the power as a

1928
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,839
therapeutic tool

1929
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,238
but also the power of

1930
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,360
triggering responses that actually uh

1931
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,199
are quite you know

1932
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,120
quite important to take into account and

1933
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,960
in fact you know it's it's

1934
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,640
you know the the paper we got accepted

1935
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,080
yesterday which is the continuation of

1936
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
this musculoskeletal care

1937
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,760
you know one of the reviewers actually

1938
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,679
wanted us to say

1939
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,040
you know there are you know

1940
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,320
psychologists

1941
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,679
in a psychotherapy treat people that

1942
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,920
memories are embodied and you need to be

1943
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,120
aware of avoiding overlaps okay

1944
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,280
so that means don't jump into an area

1945
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,040
that you don't know about

1946
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,040
and but be aware that sometimes you know

1947
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,880
you yeah you're getting that the

1948
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,480
response is pretty much you're getting

1949
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,760
into someone

1950
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,719
hidden states stuff that is there in the

1951
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,080
background

1952
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,320
just leave it alone please that's the

1953
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,640
way at least i see my you know the world

1954
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,800
around me is like

1955
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,239
don't don't

1956
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,239
don't sort of start the process that you

1957
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,960
don't want to or or if you don't if you

1958
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,000
do then

1959
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,719
go and see someone else

1960
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,600
thank you

1961
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,480
blue

1962
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,320
and then oh sorry ian and then blue

1963
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,960
oh it's okay i didn't have my hand up so

1964
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,800
over to blue sorry okay blue go for it

1965
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,679
so it's interesting um and i don't know

1966
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,159
if like in your um

1967
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,400
work as an osteopath but like there's

1968
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,640
many layers like i found like through

1969
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,679
working emotionally physically on myself

1970
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,280
through my life like it's like peeling

1971
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,000
an onion right and so as you go through

1972
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,280
um it's interesting that like

1973
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,159
like all this stuff resurfaces and like

1974
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,480
even physical trauma remains there like

1975
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,080
you stub your pinky toe you stub your

1976
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,520
pinky toe 25 times 35 times 255 times

1977
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,719
who knows how many times right depends

1978
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,040
on how clumsy you are but but your pinky

1979
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,800
toe remembers being stubbed

1980
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,960
like it has maybe like a hyper response

1981
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,560
because it's been stubbed so many times

1982
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,880
because it's whatever that's its little

1983
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,280
um job in life is to be stubbed i think

1984
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,440
um but but

1985
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,480
like it's interesting that um

1986
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,640
you know you kind of have to open it up

1987
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,159
to to do the work and i wonder like what

1988
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,560
kind of synchronous work there is like i

1989
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,400
mean i know that there are some people

1990
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,920
that deal with like

1991
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,560
physical and emotional trauma and i know

1992
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,000
like physical trauma can be a

1993
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,560
manifestation of emotional trauma um and

1994
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,080
you can have emotional trauma based on

1995
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,920
your physical trauma so again it's like

1996
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,560
this like bi-directional circular loop

1997
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,360
and

1998
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,280
um i i wonder what like the training is

1999
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,840
and osteopathy to deal with emotional

2000
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,880
trauma that may come up or um

2001
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
what kind of uh

2002
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,320
like are there people that do

2003
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,760
integrative practices like you have to

2004
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,360
be a

2005
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
like an osteopath and then maybe you do

2006
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,600
your residency as a psychiatrist or what

2007
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,360
kind of you know

2008
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,360
can you get it all out like if you have

2009
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,120
like some kind of linked

2010
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,719
problem that's both physical and

2011
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,520
emotional

2012
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,640
thank you

2013
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,880
george thank you

2014
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,520
uh okay um

2015
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,800
so the so

2016
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,040
so the model in terms of

2017
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,880
therapeutic alliance and synchrony and

2018
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,440
using touch if we use to the whole world

2019
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,920
of healthcare practice you know could

2020
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,920
argue that

2021
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,920
you know in a world of psychotherapy for

2022
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,600
example mind-body kind of stuff uh yeah

2023
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,120
the person would be

2024
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,480
um

2025
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,080
sort of um

2026
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,800
equipped with the tools to explore to to

2027
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,199
enable them to open up to start the

2028
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,600
process and being able to deal with that

2029
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,920
so so the the paper

2030
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,320
has a kind of a generic kind of model

2031
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,960
that could apply you know as an umbrella

2032
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,000
to a number of areas of practice for

2033
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,480
sure we can do that and no problem if we

2034
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,480
think specifically about manual therapy

2035
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,640
and specifically about osteopathy then

2036
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,199
you've got two worlds uh the american

2037
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,679
world of osteopathic medicine where

2038
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,480
osteopathic medicine is medicine and

2039
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,760
you know

2040
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,719
the

2041
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,040
they are there are osteopaths in the in

2042
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,080
the us

2043
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,400
who are psychiatrists as well and in

2044
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,800
that case yes that person would be

2045
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,040
ideally uh suited

2046
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,400
to

2047
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,159
be able to explore that you know to do

2048
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,800
that to kind of uh start a process of

2049
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,120
care actually using both their

2050
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,520
competences as a psychiatrist and their

2051
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,080
competencies as a

2052
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
you know also manual therapist as a

2053
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,520
handle hands-on kind of a practitioner

2054
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,800
in other countries um

2055
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,280
osteopaths are primarily kind of uh

2056
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,000
manual therapists if you want to call it

2057
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,679
that way although osteopaths don't like

2058
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,040
being called manual therapies but

2059
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,840
primarily use manual therapy primarily

2060
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,080
uh in musculoskeletal care but you know

2061
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,679
other areas of practice

2062
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,440
and we start seeing a number of

2063
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,239
practitioners going down the route of

2064
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,920
like physiotherapists

2065
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,040
using

2066
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,640
what is called a psychologically

2067
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,760
informed

2068
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,159
type of practice and that typically

2069
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,120
involves some additional training

2070
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,960
in counseling or some additional

2071
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,640
training in some

2072
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,120
you know cvt like kind of approaches

2073
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,679
like for example

2074
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,000
something like accept acceptance and

2075
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,480
commitment therapy for example so stuff

2076
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,159
that actually combined with that were

2077
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,440
hands-on

2078
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,679
is is a sort of

2079
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,480
you know

2080
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,040
potentiates the effect of the treatment

2081
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,040
that the hands-on alone would not

2082
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,520
achieve but when you come from the two

2083
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,840
kind of two different angles meeting in

2084
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,080
the middle and providing a

2085
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,360
more robust

2086
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,520
package of care

2087
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,920
you can get better results

2088
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,880
because

2089
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,159
you know the training as as a as a

2090
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,440
pre-registration level

2091
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,080
is very basic uh

2092
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,480
to sort of uh to enable you to recognize

2093
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,199
that

2094
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,960
there are things that um are you know

2095
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,600
need a referral to another practitioner

2096
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,320
even those that even those that

2097
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,400
practice in a psychologically informed

2098
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,080
type of practice like

2099
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,640
several physiotherapists uh have

2100
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,320
developed a kind of a traffic light

2101
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,960
system where clearly there are stuff on

2102
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,640
on the yellow that

2103
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,120
you know anxiety is associated with pain

2104
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,040
and so on that's okay you know you can

2105
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,920
deal with that there's some stuff

2106
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,840
kind of in the in the

2107
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,600
in the orange that you have to be a

2108
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,040
little bit careful and they clearly

2109
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,120
stuff ptsd's and so on uh where you know

2110
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,360
it's a no-go zone you know because

2111
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,440
you know you you can dive in and then

2112
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,199
you don't know if you can come up come

2113
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,600
back okay kind of thing okay so that

2114
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,360
that is typically a referral to another

2115
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,679
practitioner having said that

2116
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,360
i think there are opportunities for

2117
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,280
collaborative work where

2118
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,400
the two together can actually provide a

2119
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,800
much better service to a person that

2120
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,520
simply relying on one practitioner

2121
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,760
that can do everything i think that's

2122
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,760
sometimes exploring stuff through the

2123
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,239
physical body the import itself

2124
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,000
opens the doors

2125
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,239
for stuff to be explored at other

2126
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,800
elements of the self okay

2127
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,560
when the body is a little bit more

2128
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,880
prepared to deal with stuff and people

2129
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,440
maybe are prepared to talk sometimes you

2130
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,159
see that in cases of

2131
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,880
childhood abuse and so on you know

2132
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
kind of had some some stuff that felt

2133
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,679
good

2134
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,679
some hands-on work even the massage and

2135
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,840
the person felt a bit more confident in

2136
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,840
themselves and they were prepared then

2137
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
let's have a child and they were not

2138
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,480
prepared to go to talking therapy

2139
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,440
straight away because there was

2140
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,440
there's too much going on

2141
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,350
in there kind of embodied itself

2142
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,280
[Music]

2143
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,040
the sirens go off

2144
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,520
when certain things happen

2145
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,800
exactly

2146
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,800
ian

2147
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,280
yes so um just sort of picking up on the

2148
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,520
points from george and the

2149
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,800
question from blue um

2150
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,520
yeah really totally agree that it's you

2151
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,560
know

2152
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,960
not the job of a untrained manual

2153
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,880
therapist to kind of

2154
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,480
aim to

2155
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,159
open a can of worms of um something that

2156
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,679
you know especially if it's not five

2157
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,120
minutes before the end of a session and

2158
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,440
then you kind of say okay i want to you

2159
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,080
know see you later see you next week and

2160
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,679
i've got another client now and you know

2161
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,199
that that's not

2162
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,199
definitely not not a good idea um

2163
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,719
however as you said george sometimes

2164
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,280
people will come and they'll want to

2165
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,800
offer things and they'll want to talk

2166
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,640
about stuff

2167
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,400
um

2168
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,320
and what i was thinking about blue as

2169
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,640
you were asking about sort of the the

2170
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,480
different combinations of approaches i

2171
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,159
don't know if um

2172
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,080
george and zoe or any any of you are

2173
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,040
familiar with david bocelli's work on um

2174
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,400
tre trauma release or tension release

2175
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,080
exercises so

2176
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,520
um what

2177
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,120
you know he doesn't really go into the

2178
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,960
story so it's not kind of

2179
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,600
psychoanalytical or

2180
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,360
unraveling the stories of people's past

2181
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,320
but he has a methods for inducing

2182
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,000
kind of

2183
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,159
what i think is myofascial and what it

2184
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,239
looks like myofascial unwinding so

2185
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,600
sometimes it's tremoring um

2186
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,880
and um so it's sort of

2187
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,159
i don't think he

2188
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,239
necessarily uses touch in the beginning

2189
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,199
um but it's

2190
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,719
i guess what i'm thinking is that there

2191
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,960
are ways that if you know the ways of

2192
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,120
offering

2193
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,080
clients opportunities to

2194
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,840
unravel the

2195
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,520
bodily

2196
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,600
trapped or the the stuff that's held in

2197
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,600
the body that um where they don't have

2198
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,239
to verbalize it if they don't want to

2199
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,440
but the

2200
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,239
the in road is to induce some kind of

2201
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,520
letting go

2202
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,080
um which maybe is what all manual

2203
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,159
therapy is about to a greater or lesser

2204
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,239
degree but his you know his examples are

2205
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,760
quite dramatic you know people will be

2206
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,440
making big movements

2207
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,400
um

2208
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,159
that seemingly are uncontrolled but if

2209
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,679
you ask them to stop at any time they

2210
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,440
can stop they can bring it into

2211
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,080
voluntary but there seems to be a really

2212
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,560
big updating of some generative model

2213
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,120
through this process um

2214
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,960
uh

2215
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,920
yeah

2216
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,560
they're my thoughts

2217
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,600
thank you

2218
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,639
um

2219
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,920
i'm gonna return to our previous complex

2220
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,000
causation network now it's smaller

2221
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,360
because we're abstracting away from the

2222
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
details and think about like

2223
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,840
what are some active inference questions

2224
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,440
that come to mind and how can we look at

2225
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,080
this differently than for example just a

2226
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,800
structural equation model that's fit

2227
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,600
from many empirical studies and so

2228
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,719
here's figure 4.3 from the textbook

2229
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,080
and this is a

2230
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,159
partially observable markov decision

2231
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,199
process

2232
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,120
and it's come up in other

2233
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,880
papers and live streams so we won't go

2234
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,480
into too much details

2235
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,239
but the kinds of things that we might

2236
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,520
want to ask

2237
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,239
are like what variables are latent

2238
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,560
states or observable

2239
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,120
in general and then in the specific case

2240
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,080
for example maybe there's a total

2241
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,920
absolutely perfect association between

2242
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,840
hippocampus volume and some other

2243
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,320
clinical outcome and so hippocampus

2244
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,880
volume conceptually is observable it

2245
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,000
could be observed but in that exact

2246
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
patient's case it may not be an

2247
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,560
observable in that relationship

2248
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,520
so

2249
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,719
variables

2250
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,719
can be observable in one context and

2251
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:25,440
latent in another context so that might

2252
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,480
speak to evidence-based grounding where

2253
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,199
like okay we don't know what somebody's

2254
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,199
blood level of this is

2255
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,440
what's the most informative thing to do

2256
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,080
maybe we can measure it and then that

2257
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,480
ties their measurements into

2258
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,639
other observables so that's one question

2259
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,800
what are observables and what are latent

2260
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,480
variables

2261
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,400
what variables do we have causal

2262
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,080
influence on what affordances exist

2263
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,400
that might have intervening

2264
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,040
influence on some unobserved state so

2265
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,679
here's like pi the policy selection

2266
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:00,719
and then

2267
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,080
the way that the hidden state is

2268
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,159
changing through time

2269
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,480
that's what the affordances are about

2270
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,679
influencing

2271
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,280
the hidden state is the true temperature

2272
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,040
of the room the thermometer is the

2273
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,880
observed value and then taking an action

2274
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,560
like turning on the air conditioning is

2275
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,600
about intervening in the hidden state

2276
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,120
such that other observables are seen

2277
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,679
and then we talked also about like

2278
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,239
in what ways can we change the

2279
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,480
generative model so here's the policy

2280
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,600
selection

2281
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,000
of the practitioner

2282
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,320
and then in the interface it's like it's

2283
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,760
meeting with the observations

2284
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
of the patient

2285
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,000
the actions of the practitioner what

2286
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,080
they say and what they do are received

2287
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,000
as observations and that's kind of this

2288
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,120
dyad active that we've seen so rather

2289
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,000
than the one entity navigating and sense

2290
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,400
making in the world the joint sense

2291
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,920
making

2292
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,840
features this interface where the policy

2293
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,800
selection's on one and they're thinking

2294
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,880
through other minds their inference on

2295
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,040
the generative model of the other is

2296
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,400
what is being

2297
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,440
um

2298
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,040
intervened in

2299
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,199
how can we change the generative model

2300
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,880
the cognitive models

2301
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,280
how can we change the generative process

2302
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,880
could there be something

2303
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,560
welcoming on the door of the room

2304
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,520
that is a modification of the niche

2305
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,159
or some other design choice that helps

2306
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,440
scaffold

2307
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,080
this therapeutic niche

2308
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,280
and um

2309
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,520
yeah what policies can be taken

2310
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,400
from the toolkit that is afforded in

2311
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,880
that moment based upon the training and

2312
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,360
the equipment available and so on

2313
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,520
that influence what to result in what

2314
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,280
and that kind of comes back to this

2315
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,960
synchrony for what

2316
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,400
question

2317
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,800
just achieving synchrony is like a sort

2318
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,920
of

2319
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,520
undirected

2320
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,520
hypnosis or undirected sort of

2321
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,480
i don't know

2322
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,840
it's just sort of like this vegetative

2323
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,760
propagation of coordination

2324
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,040
that

2325
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,880
would only coincidentally

2326
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,840
be

2327
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,199
functional

2328
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,560
so having a functional outcome in mind

2329
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
then there can be a working backwards

2330
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,000
like well what observations are we

2331
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,440
looking for

2332
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,280
and then what hidden states give rise to

2333
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,000
those observations and what policies

2334
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,120
exist

2335
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,199
that intervene in those hidden states

2336
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,440
and in the dynamics of how they change

2337
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,520
recognizing like their

2338
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,800
complexity

2339
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,120
so those would just be a few

2340
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,719
active inference

2341
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:43,040
variables and approaches that are are

2342
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,600
being invoked here

2343
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,000
conversationally

2344
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,080
however the kinds of models and the

2345
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,760
empirical data

2346
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,440
to take it

2347
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,560
further

2348
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,239
are being sketched out

2349
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,000
um

2350
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,120
well it's going very fast and we're in

2351
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,840
kind of the home stretch so what would

2352
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,920
anyone like to

2353
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,719
look at or turn to

2354
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,320
we have a few other questions that

2355
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,159
previously had been

2356
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,960
raised that we

2357
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,719
didn't perhaps

2358
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,080
get to

2359
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,920
some of them are written here

2360
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,840
so anything that people see here that

2361
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,880
they're interested in or any other topic

2362
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,080
and then also just how are we

2363
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,239
coming out of this dot too

2364
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,880
what will be different in our action as

2365
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,080
we are engaged in this area of course

2366
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,840
from many different perspectives george

2367
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,520
i i loved your your your kind of

2368
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,679
proposal your summary of all the

2369
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,400
you know those um those active inference

2370
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,920
questions in fact

2371
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,520
there's a structure for piper in it

2372
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,840
right

2373
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,960
uh it can take us down the road even

2374
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,239
just sort of looking at some

2375
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,000
computational stuff

2376
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,960
um so creating some kind of you know

2377
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,320
a framework

2378
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,199
um

2379
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,400
yeah so i i i very much like it

2380
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,440
um

2381
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,440
i think there there is a sort of

2382
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,760
challenge in what

2383
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,040
what are the latents and observables uh

2384
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,880
and so on to define those kind of thing

2385
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,520
that needs a little bit of thinking um

2386
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,199
we can you know

2387
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,600
the the other stuff i think you know

2388
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,440
as you said you know probably

2389
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,560
you know working backwards would sort of

2390
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,080
becomes easier you know isn't it you

2391
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,600
know if we need kind of

2392
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,440
it is about

2393
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,159
hands-on with reassurance and you know

2394
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,480
and so on if that's a sort of what's you

2395
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,560
know the policy and so on and what we

2396
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,840
observe

2397
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,719
you know

2398
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,880
back at the beginning i think you know

2399
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,600
it's uh it would be fascinating i think

2400
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,280
in terms of

2401
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,679
the bio by behavioral kind of element of

2402
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,320
synchrony uh there's clearly changes in

2403
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,120
them

2404
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,520
in breathing changes in

2405
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,239
probably heart rate variability and so

2406
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,480
on

2407
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,199
that would be interesting to

2408
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,280
to understand you know is that a sign

2409
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,400
that the system is sort of starting

2410
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,560
changing um

2411
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,480
the process uh

2412
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,000
and they talked about the thing in that

2413
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,239
you know maybe something in the

2414
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,120
the door of the room um

2415
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,560
a couple of years ago when i was

2416
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,560
practicing in another country um

2417
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,600
i i for quite a few months i used to use

2418
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,600
a lot of classical music and opera and

2419
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,560
so on

2420
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,840
and that was

2421
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,199
actually a tremendously effective way

2422
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,440
of creating an environment where the

2423
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,520
person sort of actually a form of

2424
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,440
inducing that synchrony

2425
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,000
and kind of you know i'm i'm treating

2426
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,360
i'm kind of doing this stuff i don't

2427
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,120
need to talk that much i'm kind of you

2428
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,400
know just

2429
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,560
go with the sensations go with the music

2430
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,120
and i felt that actually that was a very

2431
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,280
good way as a process of start changing

2432
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,120
the generative model

2433
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,880
um

2434
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,199
so there is the the stuff

2435
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,440
as we kind of um

2436
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,639
proposed on the one of the recent papers

2437
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,120
the stuff that you can implement

2438
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,480
so if you

2439
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,560
doing the tactile the touch-based

2440
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,960
intervention and use forms of language

2441
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,880
sometimes

2442
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,920
to

2443
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,600
get the person to visualize what you're

2444
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,199
doing you know for example i'm doing

2445
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,199
this and i'm trying to achieve that and

2446
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,719
you think that the per you know that the

2447
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,920
person is

2448
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,880
even like interceptively robust enough

2449
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,120
to let you explore the

2450
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,880
inner sensations to situations as

2451
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,120
you know you're probably doing some work

2452
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,199
and you you realize

2453
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,199
by sort of predicting their internal

2454
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,639
states that

2455
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,239
they're just focusing too much and

2456
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,560
giving too much attention to stuff

2457
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,080
which is actually not

2458
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,440
not useful

2459
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,360
where you can just say oh you know what

2460
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,760
uh like we said in the paper you know i

2461
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,199
i have a new dog

2462
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,199
and i kind of where does the dog come

2463
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,960
from but a dog in that sense is a way of

2464
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,159
sort of breaking down that

2465
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,000
attention to what you're doing to sort

2466
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,960
of say oh okay so you you're continuing

2467
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
you know there's still the sensory

2468
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,199
stimulation there is still that sensory

2469
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,440
evidence arriving to the system but

2470
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,480
actually

2471
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,560
you start changing a little bit you know

2472
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,600
you

2473
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,280
you you're flattening a little bit of

2474
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,760
the sensory state by sort of zeroing the

2475
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,440
big things and then

2476
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,480
maybe those sensations that come in um

2477
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,679
potentially kind of change some stuff so

2478
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,639
yeah

2479
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,480
i think at this level that's for sure

2480
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,239
some some stuff

2481
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,639
to do i think it's an interesting thing

2482
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:45,760
actually being

2483
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,159
started being explored now

2484
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:49,920
with uh

2485
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,120
ted kapchuk lab in harvard uh around um

2486
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,040
acupuncture which is you know looking at

2487
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,360
synchrony as well with hyper scanning

2488
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,719
techniques

2489
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,960
and kind of finding that actually

2490
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,120
successful in terms of the intervention

2491
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,520
is associated again what what

2492
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,760
synchrony so

2493
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,960
kind of uh

2494
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,199
it's a body of evidence sort of

2495
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,719
building up i think

2496
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,360
but nice

2497
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,120
one thought on the free energy

2498
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,960
minimizing and

2499
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,040
ml dawn and several others were

2500
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,280
discussing in the chat about like our

2501
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,000
biological systems truly finding global

2502
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,320
minima and so it's a big question but

2503
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,600
just to give one thought on it is

2504
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,360
the free energy

2505
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,199
is calculated

2506
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:43,120
for a given policy sequence of actions

2507
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,840
in terms of how informative

2508
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,760
that sequence of actions is expected to

2509
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,560
be

2510
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,199
and how useful that sequence of action

2511
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,080
is supposed to be expected to be

2512
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,199
and so

2513
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,639
different action

2514
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,159
pathways are evaluated based upon their

2515
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,400
ability to reduce uncertainty

2516
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,800
or provide direct value

2517
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,719
and so if we can just maybe there's

2518
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,880
multiple things that have value in the

2519
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,360
therapeutic alliance but one

2520
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,120
um for the generative model of the

2521
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,920
practitioner might be like to reduce a

2522
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,800
number on a pain survey that would be

2523
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,920
useful

2524
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,920
and then there might be multiple

2525
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,159
policies

2526
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,199
and maybe adequacy is good enough

2527
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:30,719
and if the pathways are

2528
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,360
to some balance or shifting balance of

2529
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,080
informative and useful

2530
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,960
either reducing pain or helping

2531
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,639
understand how to reduce pain

2532
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,159
then navigating and shifting policies

2533
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,320
is something that can be done adaptively

2534
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,480
and then in contrast the policies that

2535
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
might want to be disfavored would be

2536
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,520
like the ones that are adding confusion

2537
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,679
reducing clarity of sense-making or

2538
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,159
increasing pain

2539
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:01,760
um and that's not to say that there's

2540
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,080
not moments where transiently surprise

2541
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,040
does increase or pain does increase

2542
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,280
but that is part of a policy like i'm

2543
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,239
going to touch this place

2544
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,400
that might transiently increase pain but

2545
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,040
that might be an informative action that

2546
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,000
in a

2547
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,320
extended timeline is part of a free

2548
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,440
energy minimizing trajectory and so what

2549
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:27,280
is the horizon and so on george and then

2550
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,759
anyone else

2551
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,080
uh

2552
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,000
that thing you know sort of modifying

2553
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,400
pain you know modifying symptoms

2554
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,760
it's quite an interesting thing because

2555
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,120
you know for example at least in my

2556
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,800
profession there's this idea that you

2557
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,560
know we don't treat the symptoms we

2558
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,880
treat the cause of the problem okay

2559
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,639
so you know pain is just a symptom it's

2560
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,719
nothing to worry about okay

2561
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,080
um

2562
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,600
but you know from this perspective

2563
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,280
actually me you know

2564
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,840
changing symptoms reducing symptoms is

2565
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,280
actually an important thing quite an

2566
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,280
important thing particularly if you

2567
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,639
if you're thinking about chronic

2568
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,320
conditions if you start making the

2569
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,960
person start feeling a little bit better

2570
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,840
then you probably start changing the

2571
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,480
whole you know the whole process

2572
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,239
uh if you don't change anything you know

2573
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,040
it's the how is the person going to

2574
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,120
engage in that if actually

2575
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,639
you know you can continue saying yeah

2576
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:19,520
you know

2577
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,199
you're moving much better you know your

2578
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:22,880
function is so much better but actually

2579
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,719
the person says you know you know what

2580
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:25,679
but

2581
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,440
hasn't reduced at all i'm still in agony

2582
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,320
so

2583
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,920
so i think you know going a little bit

2584
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,920
with small things at that level are

2585
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,600
quite important in the greater scheme of

2586
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,400
things

2587
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,400
in terms of changing the generative

2588
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,400
model um

2589
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,440
so it it it is clearly you know

2590
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:45,040
a fundamental bit uh of of the jigsaw

2591
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,560
and it's the same you know as you said

2592
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,159
informing for example you know this

2593
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,040
might be uncomfortable but in fact is

2594
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,840
important in um

2595
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,760
in kind of uh you know achieving

2596
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,560
something so the same way some persons

2597
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,360
some patients tell you uh it is painful

2598
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,560
but it's a good pain so again what's the

2599
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,159
value of the good pain is the reward

2600
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,480
this is a sort of anticipation that this

2601
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,159
will lead to a positive change

2602
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:15,120
thank you zoe

2603
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,360
yeah i think george just kind of touched

2604
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,520
upon what i was going to say um

2605
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,560
pain

2606
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,040
you know sometimes patients

2607
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,719
i know i have patients that come to a

2608
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,960
session and they expect it to be painful

2609
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,120
i mean a lot of people expect that at

2610
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,840
some point you know it they might get

2611
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,440
that um

2612
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,159
sort of quote good pain

2613
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,440
where they know they almost want to feel

2614
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,199
like something's happening and whether

2615
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,440
that feedback is kind of pain or

2616
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,360
something that's kind of reassuring i

2617
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,199
know patients

2618
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,119
especially with sort of osteopathic

2619
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,040
manipulative um

2620
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,360
sort of

2621
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,639
treatment they they want the click

2622
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,560
if someone manipulates them they they

2623
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,480
they come in and go oh i just want you

2624
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,840
to click me

2625
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,400
and you know the research shows that not

2626
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,639
necessarily you need that that sound but

2627
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,719
that feedback that they

2628
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:13,920
sort of want

2629
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,199
they they kind of want some people they

2630
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:21,199
expect if you do a hard sort of a more

2631
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,520
firm massage they feel like they're i

2632
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,040
don't know getting a money's worth or

2633
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,199
they're getting more sort of treatment

2634
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,960
than than

2635
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,280
if they want they want you to they kind

2636
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,960
of want that feedback to say yeah you're

2637
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,400
in the right place

2638
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,840
um

2639
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,000
and i get that a lot so i think

2640
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,080
pain is is an interesting one i think it

2641
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,280
just the

2642
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,840
the bios synchrony the that we get we go

2643
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,800
upon

2644
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,040
you know whether it is the patient's

2645
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,600
heart rate their breathing changes you

2646
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,520
see their facial expression changes when

2647
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,719
you're

2648
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,719
or the muscle tightens up nearby you

2649
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,119
kind of go on on that but

2650
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,000
i think it's what they expect to get

2651
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,840
from treatment not every patient's gonna

2652
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
come in and go yeah i wanna

2653
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,239
i wanna be in less pain that might not

2654
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,560
be their ultimate goal obviously they're

2655
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,400
not gonna say no to it but

2656
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,800
they might really just want to be able

2657
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,119
to pick their kid up or

2658
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,520
go to sleep with just being able to go

2659
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,600
to sleep not being in pain or not waking

2660
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,719
up or

2661
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,840
something like that so i think it's not

2662
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,560
yes we can clinically

2663
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,639
it's not so simple as something that we

2664
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,639
can measure imperatively it might be

2665
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:31,920
something

2666
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,400
that's you know a goal

2667
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,800
to that patient is more important than

2668
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
you know if their pain is less or if

2669
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,119
they're moving better or

2670
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,920
oh well yeah you know if we we had the

2671
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,480
technology um to say look oh look your

2672
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,480
heart rate's lower or this means that

2673
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,080
you're more efficient you know you're

2674
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,480
saving free energy because you're not

2675
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,119
expending on your pain or you know

2676
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,800
you're more efficient so it's not gonna

2677
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,800
you'll have more energy to to do this

2678
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,400
now that you're doing this better they

2679
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,040
they may not care they may just want to

2680
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,199
be able to pick their kid up um

2681
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,719
and not be in pain

2682
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,320
so i think

2683
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:09,920
what we're measuring i think will be

2684
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,440
very individual to the patient and it

2685
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,600
might not be something that

2686
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,679
is necessarily useful in terms of

2687
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,600
research um

2688
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,480
that we can quantify it it just might be

2689
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,960
that goal that's not always sort of

2690
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,280
empirical

2691
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,960
yeah thank you zoe

2692
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,199
ian

2693
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,040
thanks

2694
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,000
thanks all and um yeah just as you were

2695
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,080
saying that you know that zoe you said

2696
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,760
at the beginning i think the the

2697
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,480
intention behind it all is to help them

2698
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,080
and i'm just

2699
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,600
thinking of a scenarios or some

2700
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,639
scenarios of when um

2701
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,560
you know agreeing on the goals is so

2702
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,480
important so i'm thinking short-term

2703
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,800
goals and long-term goals here so

2704
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,280
clients who are maybe endurance runners

2705
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,840
and you know they want to do

2706
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,320
fix ultra-marathons a year and they come

2707
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,920
to you because their calves are hurting

2708
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,719
so your immediate goal is to reduce the

2709
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,560
pain in their calves so they can make

2710
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,480
the ultramarathon at the end of the

2711
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,440
month

2712
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,000
but then you know do i really

2713
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,159
if i'm if i'm aware as a therapist that

2714
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,239
there's a link between

2715
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,080
endurance running and developing

2716
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,840
arrhythmias heart arrhythmias for

2717
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,679
example and i see this person is very

2718
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:24,719
anxious

2719
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:25,920
about

2720
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,239
their goals to the point where you know

2721
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,000
it's almost like they need it rather

2722
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,199
than it's a

2723
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,800
um

2724
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,920
a pleasure

2725
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,679
as such then

2726
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,280
you know if i disagree with their goal

2727
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,600
um are we am i true you know and saying

2728
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,920
actually maybe four ultra marathons a

2729
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,840
year would be enough for you um am i

2730
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,600
just enabling

2731
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,960
this drive by relieving your calf pain

2732
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,800
um in the short term

2733
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,679
uh so you know agreeing i think agreeing

2734
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,760
on those like longer you know more

2735
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,920
broader life goals and

2736
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,800
um

2737
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,639
or referring to someone else if i don't

2738
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:03,920
agree

2739
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,639
with

2740
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,119
with that or just so you know

2741
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,719
that's a that's a more of an ethical

2742
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,719
issue everybody came to mind as we were

2743
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,480
talking there

2744
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,360
yeah that reminds me of like the kind of

2745
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,280
performances that we might see in the

2746
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,159
olympics or the medical care that might

2747
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,480
happen like on the sideline of a

2748
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,040
game where somebody has been injured

2749
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,360
but they're gonna like continue doing it

2750
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,639
almost

2751
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,719
um in a way that is like rapidly

2752
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,520
degrading potentially the future weeks

2753
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,960
of their health

2754
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,080
and then that's the ethical challenge or

2755
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,080
the decision-making challenge like is it

2756
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,159
is it worth them to hobble across the

2757
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,520
finish line

2758
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,000
with an injury that every step is it's

2759
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,159
just deteriorating the injury

2760
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,320
but then

2761
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,400
being consistent with a belief

2762
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,239
that one is a finisher

2763
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,159
or even a signal

2764
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,679
to those who are watching there's so

2765
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,679
many complex phenomena

2766
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,520
at that level

2767
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,400
um

2768
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,400
those are very

2769
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,800
interesting questions

2770
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,679
um

2771
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,440
wow so

2772
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,800
we're towards

2773
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,159
the end here i guess for the um authors

2774
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,239
and for anyone else we can give some of

2775
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:21,199
our last thoughts what are

2776
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,480
some of your next directions

2777
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,159
for this line of research and

2778
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,719
application

2779
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,199
okay so um

2780
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,119
well first of all

2781
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,679
as uh as last time was a fascinating

2782
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,600
discussion i think

2783
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,040
and

2784
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,000
learning a lot from from this kind of

2785
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,159
interaction for sure um

2786
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:52,159
within this we um

2787
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,719
sort of got some stuff done in

2788
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,880
publishing the musculoskeletal

2789
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,639
side of things we

2790
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,520
have another paper to be submitted

2791
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,400
very soon the next week or so uh the

2792
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,560
same topic but in pediatrics and there's

2793
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,880
the bulk of other stuff building up

2794
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,960
um i think you know what we want to

2795
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,119
achieve now is to start

2796
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:15,119
testing some of these ideas kind of

2797
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:16,560
empirically

2798
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,560
using different methods

2799
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,159
um

2800
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,520
from

2801
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,639
uh qualitative kind of phenomenological

2802
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:26,560
type of approaches trying to understand

2803
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,400
really what's going on

2804
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
to more

2805
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,639
you know sort of um

2806
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,360
neural bio

2807
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,719
stuff kind of along the lines of

2808
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,960
looking at for example

2809
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,000
some

2810
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,480
some markers of by behavioral synchrony

2811
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,280
like

2812
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,119
for example um

2813
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,560
you know

2814
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,800
physiological changes in both the

2815
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,080
practitioner

2816
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,440
and

2817
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,280
and the patient

2818
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:59,040
bearing in mind some of this stuff

2819
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,679
it is a bit more challenging to achieve

2820
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:02,719
because

2821
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:04,400
uh whereas for example in the in the

2822
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,480
field of psychotherapy the person

2823
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,880
practitioner is typically sitting down

2824
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,800
uh the guy doing manual therapies prob

2825
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,920
you know he's moving around so therefore

2826
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,679
the heart rate's not going to be exactly

2827
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,600
the same but you know looking at what's

2828
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,920
what can be done um

2829
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,000
and uh

2830
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,159
and you know and some you know creating

2831
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,679
some some

2832
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,239
some some models as well so the idea

2833
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,199
around

2834
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,840
computational stuff also makes sense you

2835
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,560
know

2836
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,920
to test

2837
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,800
um

2838
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,800
some of the ideas

2839
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,040
uh this is work that is building up so

2840
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,560
you know we

2841
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,760
very much look forward to kind of people

2842
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,159
getting in touch um

2843
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,159
bouncing off ideas from each other kind

2844
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,119
of uh

2845
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,199
uh looking at how we can move forward

2846
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,119
with this there's

2847
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:56,719
it's not osteopathic specific is is more

2848
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,719
than that i think at least

2849
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:01,280
it can be

2850
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,840
manual therapy

2851
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,400
you know more broadening along those

2852
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,639
lines uh he can look at uh

2853
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,639
sort of uh you know the role of some of

2854
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,800
this stuff in chronic conditions

2855
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,960
not just pain but you know other other

2856
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,159
persistent physical symptoms uh

2857
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,000
and so on so that's that's where we are

2858
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,040
it's time now to start kind of

2859
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,040
testing some of the stuff for sure and

2860
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,960
stop writing theoretical tapes

2861
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:34,000
cool um

2862
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
zoey

2863
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,639
yeah um sort of

2864
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:44,080
what george said um we've got

2865
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,159
i've got um

2866
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,199
we've had one paper accepted for

2867
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:52,400
um msk so hopefully that will come out

2868
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,520
for

2869
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,400
everyone to read soon

2870
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,080
we've got one

2871
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,600
waiting

2872
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,760
um

2873
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,040
okay

2874
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,560
okay

2875
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,400
so um for more orthopedic um

2876
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,880
general yeah musculoskeletal muscle in

2877
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,119
um

2878
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,800
muscle and bones kind of um

2879
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,400
patients

2880
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:22,320
and then um the pediatrics one is almost

2881
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,880
ready to submit um

2882
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,719
and then yeah i guess we'll be looking

2883
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,280
towards seeing where it goes and and

2884
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,920
what we can sort of empirically

2885
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,920
prove from all the theories that are

2886
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,040
kind of circulating um

2887
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,159
and going

2888
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,159
and going from there but

2889
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,560
hopefully discussions like what

2890
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,480
everyone said now will give everyone

2891
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,880
more ideas to sort of

2892
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,560
where we're

2893
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,159
where we're going or where we could go

2894
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:53,440
and different ways to apply

2895
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,440
the

2896
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,199
um principles and the frameworks that

2897
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,320
we've suggested so far

2898
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,840
awesome george uh yeah just you know on

2899
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,199
on the pediatrics uh we actually have

2900
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,880
you know one of the first lines to start

2901
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,239
exploring is is uh synchrony between

2902
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,600
mother baby and practitioner um

2903
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,159
starting with um

2904
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:19,920
not sure if we're gonna we've been done

2905
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,880
you know we've been doing a

2906
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,800
a bit of work around you know the effect

2907
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,320
of touch on premature babies um so we

2908
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,480
have those collaborations with hospitals

2909
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,800
in italy will not enable us to do some

2910
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,199
of that stuff but we we sort of start

2911
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,560
looking also

2912
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,560
you know looking at this whole concept

2913
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,360
of of synchrony uh

2914
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,760
on a triadic kind of thing so the baby

2915
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,159
the practitioner and the mother and see

2916
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,159
if actually if we find that

2917
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,400
you know the synchrony actually between

2918
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,400
mother and baby is a marker of you know

2919
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,560
for example the baby would be you know

2920
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,880
some some some

2921
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,400
some markers of um you know autonomic

2922
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,480
change you know changes in autonomic

2923
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,360
arousal for example like we observed for

2924
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,840
example the effect of effective touch

2925
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,840
uh gentle touch on the baby

2926
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,800
thank you ian

2927
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,239
uh george just as you were saying about

2928
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,199
the challenge of um a practitioner being

2929
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:24,800
moving

2930
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,800
whilst during the you know manual

2931
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,280
therapy session and yeah i'm sort of

2932
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,119
aware of

2933
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,719
how that does

2934
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:35,040
lead to some difficulties

2935
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,440
especially with the ppg sort of

2936
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,320
measurement of heart rate variability um

2937
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,040
i heard just an idea i heard about uh i

2938
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,920
don't know don't know if you've come

2939
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,880
across it and he see a wearable ecg

2940
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,400
that um

2941
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,560
incur it's aimed at increasing

2942
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,960
respiratory sinus arrhythmia it

2943
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,280
stimulates it vibrates and it stimulates

2944
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,119
the person catches them at the top of

2945
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,760
their out breath

2946
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,520
and it's designed to actually be used

2947
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,199
whilst you're walking around

2948
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,920
in everyday life

2949
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,440
so i'm just wondering if there's an

2950
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,560
opportunity there to

2951
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,360
um

2952
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,280
because it's designed to

2953
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,159
a

2954
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:16,800
increase rsa and b

2955
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,080
to be used whilst moving that might be

2956
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,559
an interesting piece of kit to use

2957
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,760
yeah absolutely

2958
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,800
cool

2959
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,679
blue

2960
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,679
or would anyone else like any comments

2961
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,800
um i just want to give a final thought

2962
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,159
so something that i'm going to be

2963
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:39,840
thinking about for

2964
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,000
i don't know whoever knows how long um

2965
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,760
is this idea of um

2966
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,239
the emotional and physical

2967
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:49,280
body

2968
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:52,639
in terms of reference point

2969
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,440
right so we we studied in i think live

2970
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,880
stream 40 the um fep for generic quantum

2971
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,560
systems and

2972
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,600
it it

2973
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,800
talked about how

2974
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,239
like the fep drives entanglement

2975
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,040
um

2976
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,159
and

2977
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,679
in this way like when there's when

2978
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,080
there's perfect learning there's like

2979
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,199
this overlapping of the reference point

2980
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:18,000
so i just wonder like how like can an

2981
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,639
emotional body and a physical body be

2982
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,880
driven toward a more overlapping

2983
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,280
reference frame like when those things

2984
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,239
are so

2985
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,080
fundamentally different um so i'm going

2986
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,040
to be thinking about that

2987
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,560
cool

2988
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,119
very cool

2989
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,679
all right well

2990
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,600
thank you for this excellence

2991
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,360
dot two that

2992
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,560
concludes

2993
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,760
44

2994
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,800
and

2995
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,520
really appreciated the authors joining

2996
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,080
and blue thank you for joining ian also

2997
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,800
for

2998
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,440
contributing so much with the dot zero

2999
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:54,560
and

3000
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,280
everyone is welcome back to give us

3001
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,119
updates on their learning and

3002
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,440
application on this very important area

3003
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,040
so thanks again everybody see you later

3004
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,719
thank you thank you

3005
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,719
goodbye

3006
