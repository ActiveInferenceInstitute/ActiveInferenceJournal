00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680
it's may 13 2022.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,760
welcome to the actin flab

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
we are a participatory online lab that

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,480
is communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
applied active inference

10
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,079
you can find more information at the

11
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,000
links on the slide

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
this is recorded in an archived live

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
feedback so we can improve our work all

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
and we'll be following video etiquette

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
for live streams

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,159
if you want to learn more about the live

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,040

head to activeinference.org

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,360
today in 44.0

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
we are going to learn and discuss this

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
awesome paper therapeutic alliance as

review slash

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,720
scoping and contextualizing

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
we're going to have some discussions in

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,759
the coming weeks on this paper with the

33
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
authors and some non-authors so

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
we're just going to be overviewing the

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
paper

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
opening up some threads getting excited

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,159
about it covering what they said so that

38
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
we can jump into the

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,040
one

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
and two discussions

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
and let's just get right into it

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,439
i'm

43
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
daniel and i'm a researcher in

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
california

45
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,720
i was very

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,680
curious about touch and active inference

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,760
which is an area that hasn't been

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
explored too much but it's something

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,160
that

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
is so critical to our daily experience

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
so it sounds like a pretty important

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
area to model or approach with active

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
inference

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
and i'll pass it to ian so thanks for

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
joining and for all the contribution on

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
the slides we'd love to

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
hear any context

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
and welcome

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
hi daniel thanks very much for

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
um having me

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
in your lab

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
so

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
yeah i you know i was drawn to this

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,840
paper for several reasons i first

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
um saw the paper by some of the authors

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,879
that got me uh

67
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,440
joining the dots between their work and

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
your lab

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
which was that was called osteopathy and

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
mental health and embodied predictive

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
interceptive framework so i've got an

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
interest in

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
um how we sense what's going on inside

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
our body

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
from a research point of view and

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
a personal point of view

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
and then also you know my main

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
what i spend most of my time doing

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
work wise is hands-on therapy so manual

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
therapy which involves touch

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
when i saw the title of this paper which

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
we're talking about today which is um

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
part of their series on

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
inactivism and active inference in the

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
therapeutic alliance

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
i you know what jumped out to me was

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,440
the

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
um the word synchrony

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
in therapeutic alliance so

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
you know this is something in the

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
therapy world

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
we often talk about synchrony um

93
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,840
and

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
i'm intrigued to see how that might fit

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,599
in with

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,959
free energy minimization

97
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
just one thought on what you said there

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
about interception which is

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
something we've talked about i know

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
you've had many conversations and works

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
on it is

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,760
touch

103
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
it sometimes feels like it's out there

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
like i'm touching objects on my desk

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
it's how they are out there just like

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
vision is something out there but then

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
touch is actually

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
inside

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
the fingers and so it's actually like it

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
is an interception about

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
the external world so it's kind of like

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
touch

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
is something inside of us but again it's

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
out it's about out external

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
objects and so how does the brain and

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
body do that and then what's the social

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
dynamics of it and then what are the

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
clinical implications i hope those are

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
some questions we can approach

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
with active inference and get some

121
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
insight into

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
yes yeah and the you know the other

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
thing what you were saying then about um

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
and i think in the interception

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,759
researchers there is a little bit of

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
debate over whether what types of touch

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
might include as interreceptive or inner

128
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
felt and there's

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
low effective touch versus maybe

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
different types of touch um but also

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
when you were saying that i was just

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
thinking you know

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
when someone says i felt touched by that

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,080
piece of music

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,039
um

136
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
the music didn't physically touch us

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,320
apart from

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
oscillating airwaves

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
but touching our eardrums um but again

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,160
it might be an interceptive experience

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
if we were

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
touched by some piece of music and it

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
sent shivers up and down my spine

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
so um yeah

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
and can

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
voice

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
maybe in therapeutic uh alliance vocal

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,479
auditory input touch people

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
cool

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
so we

151
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,759
wrote out one view of a big question

152
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720
which is kind of like a curiosity or an

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
openness that might approach somebody to

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
this paper even without bringing active

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
inference into it

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,280
and it says within a therapeutic

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
alliance can touch be used to help a

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,800
patient usefully update their beliefs

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,039
and then in the conclusion the authors

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,919
are where we're going to get to is touch

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,000
appears to be critical in initiating

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
develop the salience of synchronous

163
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,639
relationships touch can be used to infer

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,880
and predict other states of mind which

165
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
are crucial for developing dyadic and

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
triadic

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
relationships in general and in a

168
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
clinical setting

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,759
so

170
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
what do you think about that big

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
question or what

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
drew you to it

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,919
um

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
yeah on the the surface of that question

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
so

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
can touch be used to

177
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,160
you know help a patient

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
so you know

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
um

180
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
it seems in

181
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,960
kind of the obvious answers is yes it

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
can you know you see a

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
um if a child falls over and a parent

184
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
comes up and it kind of

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,199
soothes the child by

186
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
stroking it or touching it or rubbing it

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,560
better then then we can kind of see

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
an archetypal

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
version of that of a caregiver helping

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
someone who's distressed so i'd say yeah

191
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
you know yeah

192
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,639
it looks quite obvious but then

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
you know this usefully updating

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
someone's beliefs i think that's where

195
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
it gets

196
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
maybe in dot

197
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
1.2

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,199
um

199
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,880
we can explore that

200
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,919
different uh more and you know what is

201
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
what is an adaptive update and what is a

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,599
maladaptive update and who's

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,440
who's setting the pollings and where

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
does synchrony come in so yeah um loads

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
to explore

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
um

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
and you know dyadic they mentioned

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
dialect and triadic so

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
and it's therapeutic we don't have to

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,919
just think in terms of a professional

211
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,800
therapeutic setting so maybe in

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
you know i can seek counsel from

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
um anyone it doesn't have to be a

214
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,440
professional practic a practitioner

215
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
in a business type setting or a clinical

216
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
setting it might be

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,160
um

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
with a stranger

219
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
on a bus

220
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
yes what are the top-down social

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
scaffolds that

222
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
facilitate or enable or constrain

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
certain kinds of

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
touch and

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
clinical relationships so

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
cool

227
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
let's go to the aims and claims of the

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
paper so as we mentioned the paper is

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
mcparlin at all in frontiers in

230
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,720
psychology from 2022

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,680
and

232
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
some of the aims the way that the

233
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
authors represented what they set out to

234
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
accomplish in the paper one of them was

235
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
to present an empirical integrative

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
account

237
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
of the biobehavioral mechanisms that

238
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
underwrite therapeutic relationships

239
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
through the lens of active inference

240
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
and then they're aiming to argue for the

241
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
importance of therapeutic touch in

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
establishing a therapeutic alliance and

243
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
synchrony between the practitioner in

244
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
the patient

245
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,959
and i think this will be

246
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,480
really interesting to explore in the

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
context of

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
explicitly manual and hands-on

249
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
therapies and work as well as areas that

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
are perhaps not seen like at in the same

251
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
way as physical therapy or osteopathy

252
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,279
but

253
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
maybe the dentist just puts the hand

254
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
somewhere in a way that is calming for

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,600
example so even in not just the only

256
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
manual areas

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
and then

258
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
some of the claims that they make and

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,360
some that will go into a lot more

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,399
in the

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,519
paper

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
is they're gonna argue that active

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
inference provides insights into the why

264
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
and the how of humans choosing to

265
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,839
synchronize

266
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,760
they're going to claim that touch is

267
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
used to establish and also to

268
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
continually develop

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,279
synchrony

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
in our

271
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,440
lived world as social beings and those

272
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
are some of the threads that they

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
reference a lot of papers

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
and uh kind of

275
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
explore in the paper so

276
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,600
anything that you thought about just the

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,279
claims of the paper

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,240
um

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
yeah when i um

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
first read this it

281
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,839
created you know it seemed to um

282
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
reminds me of

283
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
what i hear in other sort of therapies

284
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,399
so the importance of safety for example

285
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,440
in a

286
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
therapeutic setting so if a person feels

287
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
safe then they're going to be more

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,279
receptive to um therapeutic touch

289
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
and

290
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
i'm interested to see on you know to

291
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
read and speak to the authors maybe

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
about

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,800
what things facilitate synchrony

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
um

295
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
and

296
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,200
the uh what else have we got there so um

297
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
yeah how just how the active inference

298
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
framework kind of

299
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
can potentially

300
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
unify

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
some of these different languages that

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,959
we've got in different

303
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
therapies

304
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
that uh

305
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
that that kind of

306
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
maybe are saying very similar things

307
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
um

308
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
and can does the the the i think we

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
spoke a few weeks ago the beautiful

310
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
simplicity of active inference maybe

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,680
helps to

312
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
helps to

313
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
unify those and help us understand them

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
better

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
awesome

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
all right um on to the abstract

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,079
perhaps you could read uh the first four

318
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,760
lines and i'll read the second four

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
lines

320
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
okay

321
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,320
so recognizing

322
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
and aligning

323
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
individuals unique

324
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,360
adaptive beliefs or priors

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
through cooperative communication

326
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
is critical to establishing

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,519
a therapeutic relationship and alliance

328
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
next bullet points using active

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
inference we present an empirical

330
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,440
integrative account of the biobehavioral

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
mechanisms that write therapeutic

332
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,600
relationship

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
third bullet point a significant mode of

334
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
establishing cooperative alliances and

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,680
potentially synchrony relationships

336
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
is through

337
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
extensive cues

338
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
generated by repetitive coupling during

339
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
dynamic touch

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
and then

341
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,839
established

342
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,720
models speak to the unique role of

343
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
affectionate touch

344
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,040
in developing communication

345
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
interpersonal interactions and a wide

346
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
variety of therapeutic benefits for

347
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,920
patients of all ages both

348
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,360
neurophysiologically and behaviorally

349
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
the purpose of this article is to argue

350
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
for the importance of therapeutic touch

351
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
in establishing a therapeutic alliance

352
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,839
and ultimately

353
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
synchrony between practitioner and

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
patient

355
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
we briefly a therapeutic alliance in

356
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,800
pro-social and clinical interactions

357
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,880
we then discuss how cooperative

358
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
communication and mental state alignment

359
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
in intentional communication are

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
accomplished using active inference

361
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
we argue that alignment through active

362
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
inference facilitates synchrony and

363
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
communication

364
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
the ensuing account is extended to

365
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
include the role of c tactile afferents

366
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
in realizing the beneficial effects of

367
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,560
therapeutic synchrony

368
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
we conclude by proposing a method for

369
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
synchronizing the effects of touch using

370
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,359
the concept of active inference

371
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,199
cool active inference as a descriptive

372
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,120
integrative account

373
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
and then towards the end

374
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,079
potentially some unique predictions or

375
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
implications

376
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
or usages of active inference like what

377
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
would be different about the therapeutic

378
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,320
alliance

379
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
if the practitioner and or the patients

380
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
were to be aware

381
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,240
of

382
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
synchrony or

383
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
be able to integrate some of these

384
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,360
important qualitative ideas like

385
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
consensual affectionate touch

386
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,240
with potentially some of these ideas

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
like priors and precision and synchrony

388
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
um

389
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,519
yeah and as you're saying that i'm

390
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,399
thinking about you know um

391
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
uh

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
trauma for example which is you know

393
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
when a a prior is so

394
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
given so much waiting that it

395
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,399
affects action and perception in a

396
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,040
really strong way and as you said if if

397
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,760
the

398
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
both the the patients and the the

399
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,720
clients in that alliance they're

400
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
they're

401
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,279
aware of it

402
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
in terms of what the updating of that

403
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,199
of those beliefs

404
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
um in the whole process and aligned in

405
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
their

406
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,279
the the direction and the process

407
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,839
that they're wanting to use

408
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,720
to

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
usefully update beliefs then

410
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,839
um then yeah really interesting thought

411
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
being aware of what your

412
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
the process you're going through

413
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,880
cool

414
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
so that's where

415
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
we're going to be

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
going and the roadmap is how we're going

417
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
to be traveling there

418
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,000
the

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
paper has three sections

420
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
introduction with a bunch of subsections

421
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
the second section is mechanisms

422
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
increasing saliency within synchrony and

423
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,800
the third section is a conclusion

424
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
and within this

425
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,519
very

426
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,079
multi-part introduction section

427
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
they talk about a range of topics

428
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,040
from

429
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
physical touch and the clinical

430
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
and therapeutic setting

431
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
there's a lot of discussion on the in

432
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
utero initiation of synchrony and the

433
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,040
way in which there's this transfer

434
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,560
of the uterine environment to the

435
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
postnatal

436
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
scaffolding

437
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
through the post-postnatal where i guess

438
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
most of us are most of the time out

439
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,800
there in society

440
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
and the way that touch and communication

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
and synchrony and all these other topics

442
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
are

443
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,399
sitting there

444
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
in the therapeutic setting

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
and

446
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,240
striving for integration and so they

447
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
they bring a lot onto the table with

448
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
this paper so

449
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,039
it's going to be great discussions and

450
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,959
important lines of research and in this

451
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
dot zero

452
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,520
we're going to

453
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,480
dive into mainly the keywords

454
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
and give some background it'll be

455
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
awesome to hear about the perspective

456
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,359
that you have being a lot closer to this

457
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
work than i am

458
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
and um

459
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,960
we'll just talk about the keywords

460
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
and then be ready in the dot one and dot

461
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,160
two to take it anywhere else

462
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
sound good

463
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
excellent

464
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
okay the keywords are

465
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
active inference

466
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,720
therapeutic alliance

467
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
affective touch

468
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
synchrony predictive processing

469
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,320
allostasis

470
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
free energy principle

471
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
and perinatal care

472
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,039
so let's just jump right into the

473
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,960
keywords and see where it goes so first

474
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
therapeutic alliance

475
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
what would you say about therapeutic

476
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
alliance

477
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480
okay so um while reading the text here

478
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
therapeutic alliance is a collaborative

479
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
working relationship between clinician

480
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,080
and patients and is cr a critical

481
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
component of the person-centered care

482
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
because it contributes to positive

483
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
clinical outcomes outcomes across

484
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,520
multiple healthcare disciplines so um

485
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
what i like here is that they're sort of

486
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,360
saying that it's a critical component

487
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,200
and then you know if we um

488
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
break down the

489
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
that term therapeutic alliance then

490
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
um

491
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
therapeutic meaning you know

492
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,280
helpful i suppose um

493
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,320
that

494
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
beneficial to the to the person

495
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
and then alliance as they said it so

496
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,000
it's

497
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
um

498
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
i think of you know being in agreement

499
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
and

500
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,679
working together um

501
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
understanding each other which is you

502
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,799
know

503
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
i think sometimes when people are going

504
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
to a healthcare provider

505
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
it's um maybe

506
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,960
the practitioner or the clinician

507
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
is um

508
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
fixing them or doing something to them

509
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,039
and

510
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,280
maybe they can be passive in receiving

511
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,440
that whereas i think this term

512
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
therapeutic alliance is coming

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,080
for um for the person receiving

514
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,400
the healthcare and it's the then the you

515
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
know the active inference comes in so

516
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
it's

517
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
active for

518
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
for both

519
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
parties not just a passive thing

520
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
and i see that uh

521
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
yep so there's another text there which

522
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
kind of says that similar things so it's

523
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
um

524
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
the therapy alliance is often modeled

525
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
from a work the working alliance

526
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,600
described by boarding in 1979 which

527
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
includes the collaborative agreement on

528
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
goals yep tasks and the development of

529
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
successful relationships and cooperative

530
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
communication

531
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,679
yeah um

532
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,720
yeah

533
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,039
totally true about the alliance and

534
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,120
working together as a team and they're

535
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,600
also focused on the dyad but i thought

536
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,919
of like maybe a hospital setting where

537
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,679
there's a lot of people

538
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,159
of many different specialties working

539
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,320
together like truly is a big team the

540
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,440
family

541
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,559
and the

542
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,200
the patients but also all these other

543
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
people who come through that space

544
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
and then just in terms of the way that

545
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,720
this paper approached it they reference

546
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
i guess a early critical citation board

547
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
in 1979

548
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
and then also

549
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
they referenced two more recent

550
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,120
citations um the

551
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
makiak and ryu and so on the 2019 paper

552
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
on the left

553
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,760
that paper was looking at physiotherapy

554
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
and just highlighted like acknowledging

555
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
the individual

556
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
the giving of self and using the body as

557
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,840
a pivot point so seeing that alliance

558
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
that's kind of like a constellation

559
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,159
that's pivoting around

560
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
the patient's body

561
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,280
and

562
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
also there being sort of a

563
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
broader scale movement which i thought

564
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
was really deep

565
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,720
and then the ryu

566
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
21 citation modeling therapeutic

567
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
alliance in the age of telepsychiatry

568
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
they just begin with something

569
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
uh that maybe we've all experienced or

570
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
seen occurred that things are online and

571
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
remotely and that includes psychotherapy

572
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
happening online

573
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,320
and this paper is like a call

574
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,200
for the investigation of the causes and

575
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,679
consequences of successful psychotherapy

576
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,480
augmented with computational tools and

577
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
often carried out using computational

578
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,520
means of communication

579
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,640
so a little bit of a classic take

580
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
on the therapeutic alliance as well as

581
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,000
bringing it into the early 2020s

582
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
phase that we're in where we're having

583
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,559
conversations with computers but then

584
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
where's touch and this disembodiment

585
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
that could maybe occur

586
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,799
if we don't

587
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,360
have reminders to

588
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
re-enter our body during these

589
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,120
relationships

590
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
um

591
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
yes

592
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
yeah

593
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
re-entering our body um

594
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
the other thing that

595
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,080
i was thinking of then when you were

596
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
sort of reading the

597
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,720
early

598
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
reference or the citation the

599
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
acknowledging of the individual giving

600
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,039
of the self and using body as a pivot

601
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,400
thinking about that um

602
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,559
and something that's coming up later in

603
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,240
the in the

604
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
definitions about this um

605
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
expert sort of synchronizing to an

606
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,480
expert and

607
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
maybe there's is there any tension there

608
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,159
between

609
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
the alliance

610
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,960
um

611
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
and

612
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
agreeing on goals and

613
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
you know giving

614
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,880
oneself to an expert um

615
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
so

616
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,720
yeah

617
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,520
interested to explore that later

618
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,480
great

619
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
so on to synchrony

620
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
what is synchrony and how is it being

621
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
used here

622
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
so the definition in the paper

623
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
synchrony is defined as the

624
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,080
interpersonal coordination

625
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,120
of behavioral and neurophysiological

626
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,159
rhythms

627
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
that can aid in sensory processing

628
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,720
learning emotion and arousal regulation

629
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
self-regulation

630
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,279
and the establishment of communicative

631
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
relationship

632
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
um

633
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,200
so uh another extract from the paper

634
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
therefore considering the therapeutic

635
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,120
line principles of agreement on goals

636
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
tasks and developing strong

637
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
relationships a degree of

638
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,520
biobehavioral synchrony will occur

639
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
within this clinical setting so they

640
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
seem to be saying that you know if if it

641
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
involves agreeing on where we're heading

642
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
together

643
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
then

644
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
synchrony has to occur

645
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,159
um

646
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:30,960
and

647
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
additionally they're sort of saying that

648
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
innate it is human nature to want to

649
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,919
share physiological and emotional states

650
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,880
with others

651
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
through the structured pattern of

652
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,279
communication between mother and infant

653
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,360
um the increa the interaction

654
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
synchronize and

655
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,080
an individual's behavior hidden states

656
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
of mind and biological rhythms

657
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,600
resulting in an intertwined unit akin to

658
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
a sophisticated waltz

659
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
and i see you've

660
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,360
put some diagrams there from

661
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,640
some

662
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
studies

663
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,000
involving drumming

664
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
yeah i was just looking

665
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,440
to

666
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,320
see how people were studying synchrony

667
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
in the modern time where they were

668
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,559
studying

669
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,559
various aspects of of coordinated

670
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,919
drumming

671
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,200
and

672
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
i also really like how the authors

673
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
mentioned the sophisticated waltz

674
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
or insert your own genre of dance or

675
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
movement or coordination because

676
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
synchrony is not just

677
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
um lockstep

678
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,200
metronome

679
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,520
everyone doing the same thing

680
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
synchrony can refer to turn taking or

681
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
synchrony can refer to sort of joint

682
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,400
improvisation

683
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,880
and that's this notion of generalized

684
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,360
synchrony that comes up again and again

685
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,320
in active inference so what does it mean

686
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
for there to be synchrony

687
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,039
in the therapeutic alliance with people

688
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
who have different

689
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,159
expectations preferences priors

690
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,159
bodies minds

691
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,200
lives

692
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,559
so what is being synchronized

693
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,360
that can be measured the heart rate or

694
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
some other

695
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
biometric features and then what is that

696
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,240
reflecting

697
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
and are we looking for lockstep but then

698
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
if we're not

699
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,640
what is this synchrony

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,520
with

701
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
difference

702
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
that we're going to be seeking and how

703
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
is this related to positive clinical

704
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
outcomes

705
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,919
um

706
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
yeah

707
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
yes

708
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
so much um

709
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,799
i could could go down there and uh yeah

710
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,960
maybe in the dot one dot dot two and

711
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,159
yeah we will do evolution as well this

712
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:46,960
uh

713
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,840
the regimented waltz versus the

714
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
the more

715
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,720
playful

716
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,520
jamming even

717
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,720
cool yes we will go there all right so

718
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,279
one of the ways in which synchrony is

719
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,760
going to be engendered and one of the

720
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
ways that is highlighted in this paper

721
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,840
is affective touch

722
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,559
so

723
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,000
what is affective touch

724
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,200
quoting from the paper effective touch

725
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,159
via tactile stimulation can be viewed as

726
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,279
an example of a particular embodied

727
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
social behavior that maintains

728
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,919
homeostasis and influences

729
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,120
the perception of or inference about the

730
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,559
mental states of self and other

731
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,480
moreover it has been speculated that

732
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,440
touch may cause a rapid reduction in the

733
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,480
activity of prefrontal cortex before

734
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
instantiating a sustained period of

735
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,399
preemptive homeostatic regulation

736
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,000
it has also been suggested that the use

737
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
of social touch

738
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
um

739
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
decreases the level of effort needed to

740
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
overcome stress

741
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
so here you know from reading that um

742
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
it's sort of saying that effective touch

743
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,559
um is nice i guess uh compared to maybe

744
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,679
a punch

745
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
um which might have a different

746
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
effect on our

747
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,840
uh

748
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,159
regulation autonomic regulation

749
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,360
um

750
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
and

751
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
so and the next quote is an effective

752
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
method for establishing this cooperative

753
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
alliance and potential synchrony is

754
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,200
through ostensive cues generated by

755
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,440
repetitive coupling

756
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,600
during physic physical touch

757
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
affectionate touch is unique in its

758
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,679
ability to foster communication

759
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,039
interaction

760
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
and various therapeutic benefits for

761
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
example in the context of perinatal care

762
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
it contributes to an infant's

763
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
development both neurologically and

764
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
behaviorally so again you know there's

765
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,840
this assumption that um

766
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,080
that the touch is gonna have

767
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
a helpful outcome for the

768
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,070
for the

769
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,320
[Music]

770
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,440
the party um that's receiving it

771
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,279
or both maybe

772
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
as opposed to other types of touch which

773
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
might be um

774
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
you know update someone's beliefs in a

775
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,320
way that isn't about

776
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
the part that really stood out to me is

777
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,200
like

778
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
social touch decreasing the level of

779
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,760
effort needed to overcome stress

780
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
like a pat on the back which is just one

781
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
encultured touch that maybe in a

782
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
different culture or different setting

783
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,679
wouldn't be supportive but it's like

784
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,679
there's effort needed to overcome some

785
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,880
stress

786
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,720
and then there's a pat on the back

787
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,039
literally or figuratively and then it's

788
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,240
like oh it's less stressful to bring the

789
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
effort

790
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,399
to

791
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,760
do this

792
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,000
and then

793
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
that is not a punch

794
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
like you said that effective

795
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
touch and so what is happening when

796
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,360
touch occurs in the body and in the mind

797
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,919
what is decreasing the level of effort

798
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,919
and just what is

799
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,720
touch doing in that setting

800
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,840
and then how is that related to

801
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,520
synchrony what what is the belief that's

802
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
being um

803
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,919
reinforced through touch so is it you

804
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,480
know something like i'm i'm doing okay

805
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,919
um i'm

806
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,880
able to cope here i'm

807
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,360
i'm uh you know i

808
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
i am um an organized being

809
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
not a

810
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,120
my

811
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
free energy is minimizing not max not

812
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
increasing

813
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
and then at the social level like

814
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
i'm there for you

815
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
regardless of the outcome or something

816
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,880
it could be many different things of

817
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
course and it may not even be possible

818
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
to translate it into

819
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,960
language because that's

820
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,760
this is its own language of touch

821
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,919
so what is the grammar

822
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,720
of that language of touch and

823
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,120
how do we make that affective touch

824
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,919
which sounds so endearing

825
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,200
and intimate

826
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
make sure that it is that way for

827
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
everybody who's involved in that

828
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
situation so that it's not like

829
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
for one person like their intention is

830
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,159
positive

831
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
in giving or receiving but then for the

832
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,360
other person it's like nails on a

833
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
chalkboard you

834
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,799
know

835
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,000
cool

836
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
okay

837
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
well the setting that they

838
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,360
uh mention as critical for affective

839
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,960
touch is like the in utero and also the

840
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
perinatal

841
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,039
like post birth care so

842
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,919
what's going on with perinatal care

843
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,720
um

844
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
yeah i thought it's uh really

845
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
interesting that so much because you

846
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,519
know when i first saw this paper i

847
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,880
thought it was about

848
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,279
as you said um

849
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,960
post post post postnatal um people

850
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,679
uh adults going for for some kind of

851
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,760
touch therapy but you know it when you

852
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,279
dive into the paper there's a lot of

853
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
time spent on

854
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
um

855
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,760
looking at young how young people learn

856
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,640
um

857
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
so quoting from the paper effective

858
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,440
touch is unique in its ability to foster

859
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,200
communication

860
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,640
interaction and various therapeutic

861
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
benefits for example in the context of

862
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
perinatal care it contributes to an

863
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
infant's development both

864
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,840
neurophysiologically

865
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
and behaviorally so it's contributing to

866
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
their development and you know i chair

867
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
of

868
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,720
um a potter

869
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
molding a piece of clay

870
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,640
um and you know thinking that

871
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,440
infants are we if we think of a baby as

872
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,880
being like a wild animal um that's born

873
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,760
and the caregivers are really molding it

874
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,120
into being

875
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,000
something that fits in with

876
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the culture

877
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,799
and society

878
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,840
and neurophysiologically and

879
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,279
behaviorally

880
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,840
then how does touch contribute to that

881
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
molding

882
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
um

883
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,640
second quote interpersonal synchrony

884
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,360
between parent and infra infant is well

885
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
documented through non-verbal behaviors

886
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
such as touch gaze voice

887
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,279
particularly mothers so they're

888
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,640
acknowledging it's not necessarily all

889
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
about touch um

890
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,840
it's you know we've got these other cues

891
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
face facial expressions

892
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
tone of voice that

893
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
um may

894
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,399
facilitate or be involved in synchrony

895
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,320
between the parent and infants in

896
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,039
shaping their development

897
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,799
the the clay

898
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,039
metaphor is really interesting and it

899
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,399
makes me think about

900
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,679
how

901
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,679
the baby the larva is born

902
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
physically softer like a lot of the

903
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,240
bones are not

904
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,279
converted to their final hardness and

905
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
the skull

906
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,159
has some openings and some flexures that

907
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,320
decrease throughout life

908
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
but never go away

909
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,360
and so it's like that also has an

910
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,240
analogy with like a bayesian learning

911
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
perspective where in the early

912
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,599
phases there's like more plasticity and

913
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,719
learning

914
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
more softness and openness of that

915
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,040
statistical distribution

916
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
and then there's kind of a hardening or

917
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
a sharpening

918
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,800
of certain things

919
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,679
to to oversimplify that situation

920
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,239
um and then also one relevant paper that

921
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,000
they cite is from sia unica at all

922
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,560
and that's called the first prior from

923
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,199
co-embodiment to co-homeostasis in early

924
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,280
life and so that was like a very

925
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,639
um

926
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,440
a really rich contribution to thinking

927
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,679
about co-embodiment

928
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,399
and that is also moving

929
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,960
the discussion of the clinical setting

930
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,359
and bridging it with this ecological and

931
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,520
evolutionary and physiological setting

932
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
so this is a very interesting paper and

933
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,960
and um

934
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,839
something we'll talk about so on to part

935
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,400
two of perinatal what what else can we

936
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
share about this

937
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
okay so some other quotes from the paper

938
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
often the first communication and

939
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
connection with one's mother occurs

940
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
immediately after birth through skin to

941
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,480
skin contact this skin skin contact is

942
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
recommended because

943
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,520
touch has been shown to help reset

944
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
neural oscillators and align them with

945
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,839
their parents oscillation patterns in

946
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,520
the neocortex

947
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,680
particularly in pre-janual

948
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,359
aac

949
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
which i guess is the anterior cingulate

950
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,079
cortex all while reducing overall stress

951
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,400
uh additionally okay a caregiver's touch

952
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
frequently induces a state of calm

953
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
alertness which

954
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
frequently signals to the infant that

955
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,760
the caregiver is attempting to

956
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
communicate

957
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,520
when newborn infants coordinate their

958
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
limb movements to the rhythm

959
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
of the adult speech this intention to

960
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
communicate is reciprocated a strong

961
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
bond between parent and child will

962
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,760
amplify the parasympathetic response

963
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
to

964
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
affectionate touch

965
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,280
um

966
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
so yeah what i'm you know i'm noticing

967
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,880
there is that there's

968
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
they've chosen different examples of

969
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
what might be oscillating or

970
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
synchronizing so this the

971
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,440
neural oscillations seem to be

972
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,599
something

973
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,920
back to your question about

974
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,880
uh

975
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,480
you know rigid patterns i think of

976
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
neural oscillations of having a kind of

977
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,040
relatively fixed tempos

978
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
um whereas something like limb movements

979
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,280
is

980
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
you know it's not necessarily a certain

981
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
amount of hurts

982
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
um

983
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,240
so it may be more

984
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
playful but um

985
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
or

986
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
unstructured

987
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
um so yeah that's interesting

988
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,200
and and one interesting part here is a

989
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
caregiver's touch

990
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,720
is signaling to the infant that the

991
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
caregiver is attempting to communicate

992
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,599
and so from our

993
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,280
adult perspective

994
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,000
um we might be more familiar or remember

995
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
more recently like a child tugging on

996
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,440
our shirt

997
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
with the child

998
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,599
trying to signal that they would like to

999
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,440
communicate that's like an ostentative

1000
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,560
cue

1001
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,320
from an active inference perspective

1002
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
it's like a signal that is

1003
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
directing attention

1004
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
but then this is actually looking at it

1005
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
the other way which is the touch from

1006
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,280
the caregiver

1007
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
signaling to the infant who may be in a

1008
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,280
pre-linguistic

1009
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,480
state that that they want to communicate

1010
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
and then also just this is a really

1011
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,359
transdisciplinary area to think about

1012
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,280
like the perinatal care in terms of

1013
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,599
touch which they're looking at here but

1014
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,359
also other mechanisms that they brought

1015
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
up like gaze body language but then

1016
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,119
there's other

1017
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,280
features that aren't even explored as

1018
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,079
much in this paper's regime of attention

1019
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,240
like the microbiome

1020
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,839
and the enculturation and

1021
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,119
so and then it's just funny again to

1022
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,720
think about like the the postnatal care

1023
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
does not end

1024
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,280
it just yeah kind of trails and develops

1025
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
yeah you've

1026
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,119
included two really kind of

1027
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,760
big topics there the the microbiome and

1028
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,480
you know the appreciation now that that

1029
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,560
that um

1030
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,960
passing on or

1031
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,440
the microbiome from mother to

1032
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,920
infants is is really really useful and

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,160
then bioelectricity is that more sort of

1034
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,520
like the

1035
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
michael levin stuff and

1036
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,960
what i'm thinking there is that that

1037
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,560
from that change from co-embodiment to

1038
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,160
um what was the other phrase

1039
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,480
co-embodiment and something else yeah

1040
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,920
what's the

1041
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
co-homeostasis yeah uh-huh yeah

1042
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,160
yeah so yeah by bioelectricity there and

1043
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,960
can it return during touching a

1044
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,480
therapeutic

1045
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,320
setting

1046
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
yes

1047
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,480
okay

1048
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,040
on to allostasis

1049
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
so allostasis

1050
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
the authors

1051
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,680
define

1052
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,320
in the paper allostasis is a process by

1053
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,880
which the brain predictively regulates

1054
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,839
the body metabolic and energy needs

1055
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,720
using an internal model of that body in

1056
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,680
the world

1057
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,720
and so um the citation there is to bear

1058
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,960
it 2017

1059
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,040
with the work theory of constructed

1060
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,359
emotion an active inference account of

1061
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,320
interception and categorization

1062
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,800
so that's a really uh

1063
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
cited and

1064
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
impactful paper that

1065
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,920
defined allostasis as the regulation of

1066
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,040
the internal milieu by anticipating

1067
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
physiological needs and preparing to

1068
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,920
meet them before they arise

1069
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,800
so people might be more familiar with

1070
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
the uh more popular cousin of allostasis

1071
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
homeostasis which is sometimes seen as

1072
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,560
like the return to a target range

1073
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,200
when there are deviations occurring away

1074
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,720
from that range like when the blood

1075
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,680
sugar or the temperature gets too low

1076
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,560
a process kicks in that brings it back

1077
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,520
up

1078
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,200
allostasis

1079
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
is highlighting

1080
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
the way that sometimes that kind of

1081
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,480
physiological regulation

1082
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,520
cannot wait until something has already

1083
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,480
left a controlled range

1084
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,800
and in fact sometimes changes need to be

1085
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,240
taken in an anticipatory way to help

1086
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,400
meet expected changes that are upcoming

1087
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,760
and then also

1088
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,160
a kind of corollary of that is

1089
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,800
homeostasis would suggest that we would

1090
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,599
just be converging and staying within a

1091
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,560
target range but allostatic behavior can

1092
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,000
include

1093
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,200
for example

1094
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,839
taking deviations out of the range again

1095
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,839
in service of staying in that racket

1096
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,880
before one goes outside into the colds

1097
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,400
that's going to transiently be raising

1098
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
the body temperature in a way that

1099
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
wouldn't make sense unless the person

1100
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,280
was preparing to go outside but then in

1101
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
the sort of integral of action through

1102
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
time

1103
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,040
putting on the jacket before going out

1104
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,560
into the cold

1105
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,280
is going to keep that physiological

1106
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,240
system

1107
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,079
happy and healthy and meeting its

1108
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,440
expectations

1109
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,240
in a way that's tractable whereas

1110
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,400
being inside and not needing a jacket at

1111
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
that moment and then waiting until one

1112
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,200
was too cold and then putting it on then

1113
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,160
um

1114
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,839
that sounds like some

1115
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,040
childlike behavior perhaps in the way in

1116
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
which different physiological regulators

1117
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,000
work and then just one

1118
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
place where we've gone into a bit more

1119
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,280
on the technical side of allostasis was

1120
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,640
in live stream number 38

1121
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,839
where we looked at certain um

1122
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,440
cognitive and computational

1123
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
architectures

1124
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,200
and the way that they might evolve

1125
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,920
and the way that a simpler homeostatic

1126
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,200
system could elaborate over evolutionary

1127
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,919
time to include some allostatic features

1128
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,520
yeah um and what i'm thinking here is

1129
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,280
you you helped me when you came on the

1130
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,960
innocence channel to

1131
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,920
um

1132
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,560
i think about alastasis in a kind of uh

1133
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,240
use this um

1134
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
ant colonies and

1135
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,599
policy

1136
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,720
choices

1137
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,240
of uh what the ant colony might do

1138
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,520
and i was thinking back to the

1139
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,400
temperature example um

1140
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,800
not only do we think about putting coats

1141
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,200
on and

1142
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,599
building houses and control controlling

1143
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,040
our immediate environment but you're

1144
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,520
saying collectively

1145
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,599
we have weather forecasters and weather

1146
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,560
stations to help our whole

1147
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,200
world predict into the future about how

1148
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,880
to

1149
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,880
take take action on our temperature

1150
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,079
regulation

1151
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,440
another thing then i'm just thinking

1152
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
what came to mind is um

1153
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,319
we're going off the therapy

1154
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,880
the the film don't look up came to mind

1155
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,119
of um you know this uh

1156
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,640
impending

1157
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
pressures on humanity maybe climate

1158
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,079
change or

1159
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,839
whatever and you know what um

1160
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,560
what adaptive measures are we doing

1161
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,160
collectively

1162
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
for the future

1163
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,319
yeah like a like a global or a

1164
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,200
bioregional allostasis

1165
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
instead of waiting for some

1166
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,000
toxic chemical to exceed a threshold

1167
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,560
what is the anticipatory action

1168
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
that's going to avert that from

1169
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,240
happening how can we

1170
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,119
recognize and take effective allostatic

1171
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,160
action

1172
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
not just homeostatic for all the reasons

1173
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,359
why

1174
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,319
bodies do allostasis in addition to

1175
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,160
homeostasis

1176
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,200
and

1177
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,440
that concept of allostasis

1178
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,280
it does rely on this generative model

1179
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,520
that the entity is

1180
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,319
casting out into the future

1181
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,359
and

1182
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,839
very much in line with that is the

1183
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,319
framework of predictive processing and

1184
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,800
predictive coding

1185
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,359
we explored this more quite recently in

1186
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,920
live stream number 43

1187
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,880
and

1188
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,359
without going into all the details

1189
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,920
predictive processing brings together a

1190
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
few big ideas

1191
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,160
um first it is going to

1192
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,359
hinge around the idea

1193
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,920
that what the brain or another cognitive

1194
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,359
system is doing

1195
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,560
is not simply recognition of for example

1196
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,119
incoming stimuli but rather what's

1197
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,160
occurring is like a comp down

1198
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,680
predictions

1199
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,640
top is just a spatial metaphor here but

1200
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
the top-down predictions

1201
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
that are being met with the bottom-up

1202
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,440
sensory input that's a predictive coding

1203
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,560
or predictive processing architecture

1204
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,760
and that allows noisy or sparse or

1205
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,119
incomplete sensory data to kind of meet

1206
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,319
in the middle

1207
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,119
with

1208
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,000
rich generative models of the world so

1209
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,480
that action can be done effectively

1210
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,079
again even when there's only partial

1211
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,720
data like a dark room

1212
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,319
and then also

1213
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,480
especially when we think about action

1214
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,359
and how to include predictions about not

1215
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,720
just future stimuli but predictions of

1216
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,680
one's future actions and the the causes

1217
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
of one's actions and the outcomes of

1218
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
one's actions in the world

1219
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,240
this is going to return us to a core

1220
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,560
idea from active inference and this is a

1221
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,520
quote from that paper in 43

1222
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,000
where the minimization of a prediction

1223
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,040
error

1224
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,160
or surprise or free energy with some

1225
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,839
slight differences but more similar than

1226
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,640
not

1227
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
the minimization of those terms can be

1228
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,440
achieved through multiple ways

1229
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,800
the first two

1230
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,720
are through immediate inference about

1231
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,560
the hidden states of the world

1232
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,119
which is related to perception

1233
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,839
as well as updating one's world model to

1234
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,599
make better predictions which is

1235
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,920
learning this is pointing to the

1236
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,560
relationship and the similarity between

1237
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
perception and learning

1238
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
in the bayesian brain and active

1239
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,960
inference and related theories

1240
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
and so the way in which you can reduce

1241
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,560
your free energy

1242
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,640
through learning and inference and

1243
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,760
perception

1244
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,640
and

1245
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
also reducing your free energy or your

1246
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,200
prediction error through action to

1247
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,680
sample sensory data in a different way

1248
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,520
as well as to potentially like change

1249
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,680
the world and modify the niche

1250
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,839
so predictive processing brings together

1251
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,560
the anticipatory angle that we were just

1252
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,440
exploring with allostasis and connects

1253
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,839
it to specific

1254
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,640
computational and cognitive

1255
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,800
architectures that might actually be

1256
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,319
implementing that kind of an algorithm

1257
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,160
um

1258
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,440
yeah and

1259
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,920
where does touch

1260
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,160
fit into that

1261
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,480
yep and then just one more slide on

1262
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
predictive processing

1263
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,520
people can pause to read more or again

1264
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
check out 43

1265
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,319
but

1266
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,079
one thing that maria

1267
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,559
brought up and and we've continued to

1268
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,640
like think about is

1269
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,800
where do we use predictive coding and

1270
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
where are we thinking about predictive

1271
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
processing

1272
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
and so um maybe another way to think

1273
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,800
about the difference between these two

1274
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,240
for the formalisms and the

1275
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,839
implementations

1276
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
and predictive processing for a

1277
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,680
philosophical understanding that

1278
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,599
prediction is the basis of signal

1279
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,040
interpretation

1280
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,640
as opposed to description and

1281
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,079
recognition

1282
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,640
being the essence of signal

1283
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,000
interpretation or semiosis so i think

1284
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,200
it's uh um referring to

1285
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,680
taking the active stance

1286
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,920
not just with respect to action but also

1287
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,079
with respect to our own sensory

1288
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,280
experience

1289
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,960
which can

1290
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,200
feel or one can be encultured to feel

1291
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,680
like it is a receptive process i mean

1292
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,720
don't the photons hit the retina and

1293
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,079
don't the pebbles hit our skin and so on

1294
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,000
yet even that

1295
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,720
how can we see it in a generative and in

1296
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,119
a way potentially even with agency and

1297
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,280
so here's some books that are in the

1298
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,599
last several years that are reflecting

1299
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,400
the philosophical and the

1300
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,359
neurobiological work that's being done

1301
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,160
in this predictive area

1302
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,760
yeah and

1303
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,119
yeah i really like that difference there

1304
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,280
between coding and processing if i'm

1305
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,720
thinking about touch and your comment

1306
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,359
earlier about

1307
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,760
one person might feel like a pat on the

1308
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,720
back or

1309
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,960
is um

1310
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,880
is a pat on the back but for some one

1311
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
person

1312
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,960
the processing might be

1313
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,640
supportive for another person it might

1314
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,160
be like fingers down a chalkboard

1315
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,760
um

1316
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,240
and uh

1317
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,720
yeah with you know

1318
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
any type of some person might you know

1319
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,319
most people wouldn't like a punch but

1320
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,559
there might be some people who

1321
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,760
get pleasure

1322
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,030
from

1323
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,200
[Music]

1324
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,000
from a punch so the yeah the coding and

1325
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,599
the processing

1326
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,559
yeah

1327
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,559
creating and interpreting

1328
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,400
great point

1329
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,359
okay

1330
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,839
finally to active inference

1331
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,280
so the authors uh in this paper

1332
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,680
wrote active inference which they use

1333
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,079
the ai acronym for

1334
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,319
active inference is an empirical

1335
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,720
integrative model that has been proposed

1336
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,800
to explain the dynamics

1337
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,720
and biobehavioral mechanisms of

1338
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,359
cooperative communication

1339
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,119
so they cite the vassal at all paper

1340
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,440
from 2020 it's called a world unto

1341
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,760
itself human communication as active

1342
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,720
inference

1343
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,960
and this was actually discussed way back

1344
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,000
when in live stream number three

1345
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,400
this paper has

1346
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,640
many many interesting figures and

1347
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,480
formalisms

1348
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,839
the top figure

1349
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,000
is these two brains

1350
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,079
that are communicating and it's fun

1351
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,680
because it's kind of like an equation

1352
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,040
free version of active inference

1353
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,920
and

1354
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,720
an idea on the left side through

1355
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,400
behavior

1356
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,119
is invoking something in

1357
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,400
the communicative partner

1358
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
and that is updating their ideas their

1359
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,960
cognitive model which is reflected

1360
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,040
through their behavior and that is like

1361
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,720
a feedback so one can imagine this is

1362
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,400
like a conversation

1363
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,440
between two brains and bodies so it does

1364
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,240
bring in embodiment because there is the

1365
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,960
integration of behavior in the interface

1366
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,839
between these two communicating brains

1367
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,079
and it also opens up the door to

1368
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,640
thinking about like well how do we

1369
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,760
model ideas and cognition and things

1370
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
that we can't directly observe what

1371
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,520
would be different if it wasn't just

1372
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,480
behavior

1373
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,400
in the interface what if there was

1374
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,160
biofeedback or what if there was other

1375
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,440
kinds of interfaces so that's hinting at

1376
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,040
the flexibility

1377
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,440
of active inference and also the way in

1378
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,839
which it can hopefully be insightful

1379
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,559
qualitatively or formally and then we

1380
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,480
won't go into it right now but in figure

1381
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,800
one is where we start to see what that

1382
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
formal layer looks like

1383
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,200
all states could be an entity and the

1384
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,720
niche like an entity in the world or it

1385
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,800
could be two participants in a

1386
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,040
conversation and then what are some of

1387
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,599
the formalisms that help us model that

1388
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,839
situation and

1389
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,520
uh add in empirical data and ask what if

1390
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,359
questions in a really structured way

1391
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,800
yeah

1392
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,559
and as i was looking as you were talking

1393
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,640
through those two brains coming together

1394
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,960
i was um thinking back to a therapeutic

1395
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
alliance and then thought about other

1396
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,520
types of nervous systems that might come

1397
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,680
together therapeutically so

1398
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,680
domesticated animals i've if you've got

1399
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,520
a pet dog um

1400
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,480
then

1401
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,200
we might not be able to fully

1402
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,960
communicate like you and i can with

1403
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,720
words and

1404
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,800
actions as as uh

1405
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,079
indeed in such a understand walkies

1406
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,319
and come to the door um wagging its tail

1407
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,559
and there's a almost a therapeutic

1408
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,720
alliance if you know i'm stroking my dog

1409
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,640
and my

1410
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,359
parasympathetic nervous system is

1411
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,440
um there's an agreement there between me

1412
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,200
and the dog that there's an alliance

1413
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,599
that we're gonna soothe each other

1414
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,760
um but we're not fully

1415
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,640
you know compared to uh

1416
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,680
a wild beast that might attack me um

1417
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,040
there's a different you know very

1418
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,520
different coupling coupling going on

1419
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,559
yep

1420
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,960
the flexibility you mentioned

1421
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,200
yep um

1422
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,280
[Music]

1423
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,119
a little bit more on active inference

1424
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,440
which will hopefully unpack more in the

1425
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,960
dot one and two

1426
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,359
but the authors write about active

1427
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,599
inference referring to the inversion of

1428
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,640
bayesian generative models of the sensed

1429
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,520
world

1430
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,280
so we can talk more about the sort of

1431
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,200
recognition model and the generative

1432
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,400
model

1433
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,559
and then they also explore in

1434
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,880
their unpacking of active inference the

1435
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,599
ways in which perception and action

1436
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,800
are both

1437
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,640
in the common game of reducing surprise

1438
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,200
reducing expected free energy

1439
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,319
so lots to talk about but the big

1440
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,160
questions are pretty much as always

1441
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,640
what is active inference and how is

1442
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,800
active inference being applied in this

1443
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,079
paper

1444
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,200
and then

1445
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,359
this is the realism instrumentalism

1446
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,880
question

1447
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,040
are the bodies doing active inference

1448
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,760
do they have a choice to do it or not

1449
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,559
or is this an approach that we're taking

1450
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,880
to model these bodies

1451
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,720
so is active inference the territory

1452
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,680
of the clinical relationship

1453
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
and or

1454
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,119
is active inference a map

1455
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,119
of the clinical relationship that's

1456
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,240
constructed about that territory

1457
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,520
and so that's something that's always

1458
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,760
very rich to explore again is it

1459
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,000
something that the bodies are doing that

1460
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,559
the physical therapist and the clients

1461
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,920
are doing

1462
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,559
or is this how we're modeling what they

1463
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,240
are doing then what are they doing

1464
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,280
yes um

1465
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,559
oh so much to to possibly say about that

1466
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,680
yep won't go there quite yet perfect

1467
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,440
and then um

1468
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,960
what would you like to add about the

1469
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,119
free energy principle and about the

1470
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,720
bowline at all

1471
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,839
paper

1472
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,680
yeah so um

1473
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,880
uh

1474
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,119
i took a quote back from there the other

1475
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,559
some of the authors on this paper were

1476
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,920
on the other paper in the series on

1477
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,319
inactivism and active inference

1478
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,200
so there they said

1479
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,839
the free energy principle herein free

1480
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,440
energy is defined as the difference

1481
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,040
between

1482
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,960
system's predicted state and their

1483
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,880
actual state

1484
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,040
thus minimizing free energy means

1485
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,760
avoiding surprise to keep within

1486
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,280
physiological bands and the entropy

1487
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,240
of the system low

1488
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,359
and you know a prerequisite is that for

1489
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,280
this notion is that different states are

1490
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,200
separated by markov blankets which

1491
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,119
define the boundaries of a system

1492
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,000
statistically by separating the

1493
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,079
internal states from the external states

1494
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,119
however

1495
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,440
active and sensory states

1496
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,079
active states are governed by

1497
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,599
internal states

1498
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,440
but affect external states whereas

1499
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,640
sensory states are governed by external

1500
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,000
states but affect internal states

1501
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,559
free energy

1502
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,200
is minimized either by perception as you

1503
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,740
said on the earlier slides

1504
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,160
[Music]

1505
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,000
by updating the prediction based on the

1506
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,079
sensation or action changing the

1507
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,680
sensation through

1508
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,319
action to match prediction

1509
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,359
um

1510
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,920
so when i when i read these last bits

1511
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,680
and thinking about the markov blanket

1512
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,200
and touch

1513
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,480
and you know you sort of said um is the

1514
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,040
is the touch internal or external and

1515
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,680
then i'm thinking about this co-embodied

1516
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,599
baby inside the womb

1517
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,720
um where's the markov blanket there and

1518
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,839
where does the touch begin and end

1519
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,720
and

1520
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,559
you know touching

1521
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,480
someone physically in a therapy session

1522
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,400
or touching them with your words

1523
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,680
uh

1524
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,520
and when someone becomes synchronized

1525
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,040
and starts to minimize free energy as

1526
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,119
their new markov blanket formed between

1527
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,599
the coupled agent lots i'd like to

1528
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,000
have answers for

1529
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,960
awesome questions we'll go into it

1530
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,720
so that covers many of the keywords and

1531
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,960
background concepts

1532
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,079
let's jump to figure one and so the

1533
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,359
paper has

1534
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,440
just very clear and delightful figures

1535
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,079
and this is figure one the caption is an

1536
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,160
overview of the effects of touch and

1537
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,480
therapeutic alliance on the different

1538
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,040
networks of the brain so here in the

1539
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,920
sensor is a representation of a brain

1540
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,880
and then

1541
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,040
with the labeling

1542
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,680
of some different brain regions and

1543
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,839
networks and systems

1544
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,319
they're referencing different empirical

1545
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,480
work over the previous decade that has

1546
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,119
been connecting different brain region

1547
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,400
function and activation to all of these

1548
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,640
functions of

1549
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,000
bodies and brains and minds so what's

1550
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,440
one that's like interesting to you or

1551
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,760
what do you see or how do we think about

1552
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,640
this sort of um

1553
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,200
representation of brain regional

1554
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,000
function while also respecting the

1555
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,240
holistic and the integrity of like the

1556
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,839
brain as a unit and the brain and the

1557
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,160
body

1558
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,400
yeah i'm just gonna sort of pick out

1559
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,559
there the the person

1560
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,640
on the massage coach um

1561
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,160
being touched and the you know you've

1562
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,040
got the ct fibers there uh c tactile

1563
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,799
fibers which

1564
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,559
maybe are involved in this slow

1565
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,079
affectionate touch

1566
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,640
and the word insular there so

1567
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,480
um

1568
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,319
we talked before about that that picture

1569
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,319
of fascia on your your wall and um

1570
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,400
you know is the the connection between

1571
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,200
the seed tactile fibers

1572
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,760
uh and the insular um

1573
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,000
through the connective tissue

1574
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,480
uh that's you know joining the brain a

1575
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,920
region of the brain

1576
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,200
up to

1577
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,119
the person's fingers

1578
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,280
um that's that stood out to me cool yeah

1579
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,200
it'll be awesome like to hear from

1580
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
authors and others just

1581
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,960
what kind of work

1582
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,920
did

1583
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,240
draw these connections and what are the

1584
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,680
next steps for developing that

1585
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,760
connection and understanding how there's

1586
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,319
synchrony within and among brain regions

1587
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,079
and within and among brains

1588
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,599
anything else to add on figure one

1589
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,000
um

1590
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,480
yeah just that the hypothalamus word

1591
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
just jumped out to me there so um

1592
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,400
if we're talking about sort of

1593
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,559
minimizing free energy and

1594
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,839
um

1595
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,920
the autonomic nervous system

1596
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,480
so one question that sort of came up

1597
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,839
when i first read the paper was

1598
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,520
we

1599
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,040
what are we on what level are we

1600
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,880
agreeing where the set points are that

1601
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,440
we're synchronizing towards or staying

1602
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,559
within so

1603
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,440
the

1604
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,200
37 degrees c is the archetypal um

1605
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,799
temperature set point but not all

1606
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,799
members of a you know

1607
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,040
a duck egg has a slightly different

1608
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,480
preferred temperature than the chicken

1609
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
egg as it's been incubated and at what

1610
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,960
point in our evolution did

1611
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,319
we those those birds cooperatively

1612
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,640
agree within their therapeutic alliance

1613
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,599
to

1614
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,799
re

1615
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,000
to adjust

1616
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,119
their

1617
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,480
step points

1618
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
and maintain that through whatever

1619
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,559
active inference

1620
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,520
um

1621
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
yeah those sorts of questions

1622
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,280
cool

1623
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,599
so on this slide i

1624
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,359
picked out just a few words that were

1625
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,359
really jumping out

1626
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,760
like touch as a core

1627
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,799
term

1628
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,960
and then the authors talked a lot about

1629
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,359
uncertainty repetition

1630
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,839
safety empathy synchrony and salience

1631
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,480
and i found the paper of

1632
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,520
mason 2019

1633
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,160
and this safety and uncertainty

1634
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,720
framework which is kind of interesting

1635
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,160
because in active inference we often

1636
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,359
take a very

1637
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,359
formal approach to precision and

1638
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,520
certainty and confidence approaching

1639
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,200
those terms

1640
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
basically how they're used in bayesian

1641
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,400
statistics like confidence is a

1642
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,760
hyperparameter or precision is a

1643
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,760
parameter that reflects the variance of

1644
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,280
a distribution

1645
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,960
and here's like a two by two matrix

1646
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,119
that is just saying

1647
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,640
where are we

1648
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,960
from certainty to uncertainty

1649
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,480
and safety to unsafety and that can be

1650
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,440
the physical and the social and the the

1651
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,720
cognitive

1652
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,160
and so how do we find ourselves

1653
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,559
in safer situations

1654
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,839
while respecting the variation among

1655
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,520
situations and where do we want to be

1656
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,119
and something about seeing this

1657
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,359
matrix

1658
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,000
gave me some certainty and safety almost

1659
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,119
like actually it is okay to be uncertain

1660
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,599
and if it's harmful then unsafe is not

1661
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,760
where one might want to be most of the

1662
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,799
time

1663
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,799
but we also cannot only stay in the pure

1664
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,359
safety area

1665
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,960
100 of the time

1666
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,079
so how is the therapeutic alliance in

1667
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,720
our own lives outside of the doctor's

1668
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,559
office

1669
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,079
how are we

1670
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,200
in these quadrants and in this way

1671
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,280
and how does this qualitative and kind

1672
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,079
of personal way of relating to safety

1673
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,480
and certainty related to perhaps more

1674
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,240
formal representations that we would

1675
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,359
bring in active inference

1676
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,000
brilliant um yeah and that you know

1677
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,440
those axes

1678
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,160
remind me of the valence and affect um

1679
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,000
axes so

1680
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,720
uncertainty could be like

1681
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,079
uncertainty certainly could be like

1682
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,000
arousal and calmness and safety and

1683
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,599
unsafe could be

1684
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,359
pleasant and unpleasant

1685
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,039
and then you know it's might as you said

1686
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,720
it might be fine to be safe and

1687
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,960
uncertain it might be fine to be

1688
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,799
aroused and pleasant

1689
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,799
um in which is excited but i don't want

1690
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,720
to spend too much time excited because

1691
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,839
it's um is energy

1692
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,079
you know it's from a free energy

1693
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,359
minimization it's quite maybe costly so

1694
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,960
um

1695
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,400
yeah and where does

1696
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
the therapeutic alliance and

1697
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,319
co-regulation come into all of that what

1698
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,200
are we agreeing on is uh is a good

1699
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,880
balance

1700
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,599
and um safety and certainty are going to

1701
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:38,319
be

1702
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,359
very situational and related to that

1703
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,920
experience of the patient in this

1704
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,160
setting so how can we foster

1705
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,559
a setting where people with very

1706
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,400
different backgrounds and priors and

1707
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,280
expectations and preferences

1708
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,200
can feel

1709
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,799
and be where they want to be in that

1710
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,240
quadrant maybe they even have different

1711
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,480
preferences for safety or there might be

1712
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,559
different preferences for certainty

1713
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,000
itself

1714
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,640
okay so

1715
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
adaptation to experts based on

1716
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,599
hierarchical structure and you have um

1717
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,000
brought up this creation of atom

1718
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,400
painting by michelangelo so what made

1719
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,640
you share this art and what did you see

1720
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,640
in the section

1721
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,359
so um when i was thinking about touch i

1722
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,039
started to think and i thought i really

1723
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,599
liked this section the paper about

1724
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,280
the role of experts and i've not thought

1725
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,200
about it in

1726
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,680
what in that way in the therapeutic

1727
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,319
alliance so they used an example which

1728
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,119
was really helpful to me of um a child

1729
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,440
again going back to child and the parent

1730
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,440
is the expert and it's the

1731
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,799
through touch

1732
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,319
the

1733
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,680
child is

1734
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,559
learning how to maybe regulate itself or

1735
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,520
soothe itself um

1736
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,599
so that's one example and then i start

1737
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,680
to think okay as we grow older or in

1738
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,839
different environments who's the expert

1739
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,760
and who's

1740
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,359
regulating us and you could say it's you

1741
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,559
know

1742
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,880
peers it could be a boss at work is the

1743
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,160
expert or in the practitioner

1744
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,200
patient example it's assumed to be the

1745
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,000
the clinician or the practitioner

1746
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,920
but then i thought okay above that we've

1747
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,160
got governments and politicians and then

1748
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,160
i thought above that we've got these

1749
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,920
um

1750
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,480
symbolic maybe or from religion we've

1751
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,799
got the god is the expert and that's

1752
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,680
when i sort of googled this picture and

1753
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,880
interestingly um on wikipedia it says

1754
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,480
that got you know if you look at that

1755
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,119
picture the god touching adam is um

1756
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,119
the shape around him is

1757
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,400
looks like a brain and it's been

1758
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,880
supposed that that's uh you know um

1759
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,640
suppose the

1760
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,240
internal model of the the world's um

1761
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,799
held in the the brain and

1762
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,720
you know which which model

1763
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,039
we're held with inside us

1764
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,280
um and how is that playing out their

1765
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,039
active influence

1766
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,240
wow

1767
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,160
here's all the all the brain regions in

1768
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,839
figure one

1769
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,078
um

1770
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,880
all of these other um spirits and

1771
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,160
entities

1772
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,599
and then

1773
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,440
crossing the markov blanket

1774
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,599
tantalizingly close to touch but with

1775
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,839
that interface between them

1776
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,839
but is there a space between with the

1777
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,280
shared gaze

1778
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,839
and the shared regime of attention

1779
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,359
so it's very

1780
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,000
powerful interpretation we can

1781
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
do some more um art and meme

1782
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,760
interpretation because i it's just

1783
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,520
really awesome how you shared that here

1784
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,119
there's a section in the paper on

1785
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,680
adaption of priors to a ch

1786
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,760
and that's going to be something we'll

1787
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,359
go more into detail in but in this paper

1788
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,400
they wrote

1789
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,480
the canonical loop of coupled action

1790
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,720
perception cycles is the process by

1791
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,520
which dyads generate and modify cycles

1792
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,599
until they achieve the end goal of

1793
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,599
aligning their mental states and

1794
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,160
communicative exchanges this really

1795
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,640
highlights that we're not again talking

1796
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,200
about metronomes in lockstep synchrony

1797
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,680
can include a conversation with two

1798
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,680
people with different perspectives so

1799
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,280
synchrony is something a bit more

1800
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,720
general or looser than just

1801
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,799
the metronome and the paper that they

1802
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,039
cite first in 2015

1803
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,599
shows some of the interesting modeling

1804
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,400
that's been done around birdsong

1805
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,920
and so they model

1806
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,400
a birdsong conversation

1807
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,280
where

1808
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,119
there's a shared narrative

1809
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,280
or they're singing from the same hymn

1810
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,520
sheet and

1811
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,839
without going into any of the technical

1812
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,160
details there's an expectation of how

1813
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,000
the song should sound

1814
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,599
like i know how some songs sound

1815
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,640
and then a bird either finds itself

1816
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,039
engaging in the action of singing that

1817
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,960
part of the song

1818
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,200
and then

1819
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,880
stops singing after its turn duration

1820
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,319
has occurred and there's some reasons

1821
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,480
why it stops singing and then the other

1822
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,839
bird expecting the song to continue

1823
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,839
can reduce its uncertainty about the

1824
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,238
continuity of the song through two ways

1825
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,960
perception slash learning and action

1826
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,319
and so as long as your partner is

1827
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,560
singing you're reducing your uncertainty

1828
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,238
about the song or the conversation by

1829
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,839
listening actively

1830
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,080
and then when they stop

1831
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,679
you might continue to reduce your

1832
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,839
uncertainty about the conversation or

1833
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,479
the song by engaging in action and so

1834
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,158
that's exactly what happens with this

1835
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,399
generalized synchrony and the synchrony

1836
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,279
manifold that's happening within

1837
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,479
one bird among brain regions and then

1838
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,799
modeled in this paper of fristen and

1839
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,439
frith with between two birds engaging in

1840
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,158
this spurred song conversation

1841
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,759
um

1842
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,158
yeah and that's reminded me of something

1843
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,839
else that stood out to me in the paper

1844
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,120
about this

1845
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,920
um

1846
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,040
they mentioned a couple of times that um

1847
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,319
the basic one of the basic things that

1848
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,000
is being assumed in a therapeutic

1849
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,799
alliance or hopefully is an end point is

1850
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,719
that we are all identical or we're all

1851
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:15,679
alike

1852
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,359
that was mentioned a couple of times in

1853
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,560
the paper and as you're sort of talking

1854
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,880
about the birds you know that and their

1855
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,719
expectation that that song is something

1856
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,880
that they hear and that they're going to

1857
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,640
sing themselves

1858
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,238
you can see maybe why music and um

1859
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,198
language is helping us it's

1860
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,000
you know

1861
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,600
self-evidently

1862
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,920
perpetuate our identity

1863
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,799
um

1864
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,560
but then you know i think i heard

1865
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,799
somewhere it might not be true that

1866
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,719
um

1867
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,520
birdsong is soothing for humans as well

1868
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,759
so is it helping us

1869
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,839
remember that we're part of this

1870
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,760
community

1871
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,560
ecological community that's uh

1872
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,400
um

1873
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,360
not i'm not identical in the

1874
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,080
species sense but

1875
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,800
some other sort of a likeness

1876
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,560
or expectation

1877
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,320
the the inter-species alliance

1878
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,640
one other section that

1879
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,640
they have in the paper

1880
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,080
is increasing saliency within synchrony

1881
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
so some important questions that we'll

1882
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,360
discuss more what is salience

1883
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,280
how are salience and synchrony

1884
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,640
associated

1885
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,840
how is salience similar or different to

1886
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,560
observation or attention

1887
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,320
regime of attention

1888
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,719
and then they focus on a few different

1889
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,280
categories of mechanisms including

1890
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,920
physiological mechanisms

1891
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,120
social mechanisms that promote synchrony

1892
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,640
via salience

1893
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,960
and clinical mechanisms

1894
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,239
so if it's about synchrony again not in

1895
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,159
the lock-step way in this generalized

1896
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,239
synchrony way like a conversation

1897
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,400
therapeutic alliance as an improvised

1898
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,560
controlled novelty productive

1899
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,320
conversation

1900
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,840
how will synchrony occur

1901
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,239
and what is the relationship of salience

1902
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,199
to synchrony is it a precursor is it a

1903
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,239
an after effect are they one in the same

1904
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,280
and then what are some of the mechanisms

1905
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,880
that could be

1906
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,760
fostered to increase salience and

1907
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,840
synchrony or what are some of the rate

1908
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,159
limiting steps that one might look at if

1909
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,960
they wanted to promote like or heal

1910
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,080
synchrony and salience

1911
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,000
healing synchrony and salience yeah

1912
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,760
and um the

1913
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,239
you know the since the the free energy

1914
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,159
principle and a lot of the active

1915
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,000
inference work uses

1916
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,120
exploits mathematics it's um

1917
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,920
stephen strogatz's work on the maths of

1918
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,360
synchrony

1919
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,560
and

1920
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,800
uh i don't you know i don't profess to

1921
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,640
understand it

1922
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,199
um but it'll be interesting to see

1923
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,679
if um

1924
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,520
that

1925
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,120
mathematics

1926
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,679
could be integrated with the

1927
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,280
fep math to help understand how

1928
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,400
like you say synchrony in these

1929
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,040
in something like social mechanisms

1930
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,080
might occur mathematically so in figure

1931
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,040
two

1932
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,440
we have pulled back from the single

1933
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,239
brain figure one we were it was inside

1934
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:35,600
out we were in the one brain context and

1935
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,719
figure two

1936
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,520
takes us into the two brain

1937
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,560
communicating brains and bodies context

1938
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,080
and the caption is therapeutic alliance

1939
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,320
as active inference and there's a

1940
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,440
similar

1941
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,080
aesthetic genre where

1942
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,679
now instead of the one brain with the

1943
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,280
brain regions being highlighted in

1944
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,719
different functions

1945
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,600
now we're seeing at the dyad

1946
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,239
with this sort of handshake or touch

1947
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,800
occurring between them we're seeing

1948
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,199
different functions and facets of the

1949
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,760
therapeutic alliance that are labeled

1950
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,960
with a

1951
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,640
through j

1952
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,520
so

1953
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,679
what were one of these like functions

1954
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,199
that stood out to you or you think it's

1955
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,600
interesting

1956
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
hmm

1957
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,360
yeah um

1958
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,920
i'm looking at thee now so the

1959
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,760
the it looks like someone on some

1960
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,520
crutches and then there's

1961
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,800
um

1962
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,199
caregiver helping the person

1963
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,360
and then thinking back to the you know

1964
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,000
the alliance bits i'm um

1965
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,480
thinking what the shared goals might be

1966
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,320
there so

1967
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,480
you know it's um is the

1968
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,000
the

1969
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,600
the caregiver

1970
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,440
you know agreeing with the person on

1971
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,000
what they're gonna do rehab wise

1972
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,440
um

1973
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,000
and then how might that when it comes to

1974
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,520
touch

1975
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,600
help the person update their beliefs

1976
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,640
about how soon they can they can heal

1977
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,560
um so that it becomes uh

1978
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,000
a smoother process as possible

1979
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,960
yeah

1980
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,320
and what i'm really liking about this

1981
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,600
it's bringing in some aspects of

1982
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,679
the therapeutic alliance and process

1983
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:22,719
that

1984
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,360
at least from what i've seen or not

1985
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,280
discussed in such a holistic way like

1986
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,280
f what have i done

1987
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,679
like just the confusion and shock when

1988
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,679
something surprising is happening in the

1989
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,120
body and it's like

1990
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,360
am i gonna be able to use this finger

1991
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,520
again and

1992
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,320
how could i feel selfish about having

1993
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,400
injured my finger in this way when

1994
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,640
others are in this situation

1995
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,199
and some of these like metacognitive

1996
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:55,440
states like h anxiety over the injury

1997
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,920
the bark can be worse than the byte

1998
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,280
and then j

1999
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,679
previous priors so that could be

2000
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,640
consciously or experienced priors or

2001
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,040
just in a broader sense implicit

2002
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,719
statistical priors

2003
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,880
surrounding the injury including injury

2004
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,159
beliefs

2005
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,239
social expectations and family and

2006
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,760
injury history

2007
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,280
and so that kind of takes the

2008
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,960
predisposition family history

2009
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,560
epigenetic

2010
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,040
perpetuating cycles

2011
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,400
discussion

2012
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,800
and puts it into this prior

2013
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,040
expectation preference

2014
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,159
framework

2015
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,480
like what does one expect health to look

2016
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,600
like given the types of health that they

2017
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,640
saw

2018
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,320
in their family development

2019
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,320
yeah in their family and

2020
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,639
maybe

2021
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,640
culturally we've got

2022
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,840
these expectations about

2023
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,040
um uh obesity and then you know uh

2024
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,840
the

2025
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,679
what we're being

2026
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,280
um

2027
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,040
what types of products are available to

2028
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,159
us what types of foods are in our

2029
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,159
in our niche um

2030
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,560
and then when you get into epigenetics

2031
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,000
and all of that then it soon becomes uh

2032
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,159
very interesting

2033
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,880
great well i think this the figures are

2034
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,719
are very evocative and they'll be

2035
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,199
excellent for the discussions to just

2036
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,960
reflect on

2037
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,040
one other section just to leave a little

2038
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,159
footnote

2039
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,800
is they wrote about

2040
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,760
allostasis coordination attention and

2041
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,840
the stag hunt so they brought together

2042
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,400
all these very cool ideas

2043
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,960
and brought it to the setting of the

2044
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,239
stag hunt

2045
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,560
which is a classical

2046
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,000
game theory and philosophy setting and

2047
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,159
this is a matrix that can be read as

2048
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,080
like a payoff matrix

2049
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,080
and there's two participants

2050
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,840
who can either

2051
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,360
choose to hunt for rabbit hair

2052
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,760
which has a smaller

2053
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,360
possible payoff

2054
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,400
but one can hunt it alone

2055
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,679
however if they both engage in the stag

2056
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:10,640
hunt

2057
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,560
like the big prize

2058
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,040
they can have a higher payoff so if they

2059
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,360
both collaborate and work on the stag

2060
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,760
hunt they could both get you know half

2061
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,040
of a stag

2062
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,920
whereas if they both go for the hair

2063
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,719
then

2064
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,960
perhaps they could both be confident or

2065
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,800
sure or not sure about getting a hair

2066
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,120
but like it's like a smaller possible

2067
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,040
reward but it doesn't require

2068
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,480
coordination

2069
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,880
and this has explored some of the

2070
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,440
philosophical and social implications

2071
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,760
with the citation that they provide to

2072
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,040
skirms

2073
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,800
2001

2074
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,640
and this is just a very

2075
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,199
uh rich area for thinking about

2076
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,520
collaboration coordination

2077
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,040
public goods what kind of preplay

2078
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,400
helps people

2079
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,719
go for the stack again this isn't just

2080
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,120
about meat hunting this is like a model

2081
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
of generalized coordination like we

2082
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,159
could co-author an amazing paper or we

2083
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,679
could have two

2084
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,080
lesser papers that might take longer but

2085
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,440
of course we could also engage in the

2086
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,600
collaboration and get bogged down and

2087
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,320
then we could have no paper so how do we

2088
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,679
manage the risks and the reward of

2089
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,080
coordination and collaboration how is

2090
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,440
that related to shared attention

2091
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,840
and how is that related to allostasis

2092
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,679
where's touch

2093
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,480
so

2094
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,040
they're really just bringing in so many

2095
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,040
 threads and and i was not

2096
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,360
expecting the stag hunt to appear

2097
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,400
but then

2098
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,320
applying the stag hunt to the

2099
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,760
therapeutic alliance is quite

2100
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,280
interesting

2101
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,440
um

2102
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,600
yeah

2103
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,920
um

2104
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,960
yes and the you know the the kind of

2105
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,760
alliant that the working together

2106
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,120
for

2107
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,920
the benefits of the the alliance versus

2108
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,640
maybe giving someone some

2109
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,239
exercises to do on their own um

2110
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,400
or pursuing self-care on their own

2111
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,840
versus

2112
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,640
care in a in an alliance way is uh i've

2113
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,159
not thought about it in that way before

2114
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,600
in terms of the

2115
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,480
you know the the group benefit of group

2116
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,159
work versus self-care on one's own

2117
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,120
yeah like a regional emergency room

2118
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,920
what does it look like for us to

2119
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,560
be cooperating as best as we can with

2120
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,679
the health needs of this area

2121
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,320
how are we gonna be going for the stag

2122
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,360
together

2123
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,480
rather than

2124
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,400
succeeding or failing to get the rabbit

2125
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,799
alone

2126
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,239
um and then oh yeah go for it

2127
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,080
um no i think it's slightly slightly off

2128
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,520
topic i was just thinking about the you

2129
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,800
know the

2130
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,719
more related to the stag how we approach

2131
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,840
agriculture at the moment and um

2132
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,199
uh

2133
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,920
you know for the the benefit of being

2134
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,480
able to get lots of food for cheap but

2135
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,640
cheap and in abundance on our health

2136
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,120
seems immediately to be a

2137
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,120
a benefit but then for the overall

2138
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,679
health of um

2139
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,040
cheap abundant

2140
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,440
foods

2141
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,480
long term might not be that good if as

2142
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,159
opposed to going out and moving your

2143
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,080
body and um

2144
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,400
uh foraging on your own which takes more

2145
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,800
energy but you're

2146
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,719
um it's better for your health arguably

2147
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:31,520
cool

2148
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,400
and then just one other random note or

2149
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,840
reference to bring in

2150
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,600
this is a paper that i worked on in 2018

2151
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,920
with my partner alexandra

2152
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,480
and we were highlighting this

2153
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,440
communication and co-creation

2154
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,960
not from the clinical

2155
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,960
therapeutic alliance setting but from

2156
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,080
the joint

2157
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,520
drawing and joint improvisation setting

2158
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,560
but we touched on a lot of very similar

2159
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,600
topics

2160
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,920
about consensual and positive

2161
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,280
communication

2162
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,600
and controlled novelty and the narrative

2163
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,960
trajectory

2164
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,880
so i wondered

2165
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,320
where's art

2166
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,880
and aesthetics and beauty

2167
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,679
and some of these other ineffables or

2168
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,280
semi-effables

2169
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,600
in the therapeutic relationship you have

2170
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,840
a um a body

2171
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,560
on your wall behind you i have a body on

2172
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,920
the wall behind me

2173
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,800
the body is beautiful and where does art

2174
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,520
and culture and touch and healing come

2175
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,679
together

2176
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,480
well yeah the you know the art is the

2177
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:43,040
expressed outward kind of um

2178
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,520
output of

2179
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,639
some imagery or symbols that the artist

2180
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:49,840
has

2181
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,280
found within them

2182
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,000
um and therapeutically you know the use

2183
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,320
of visualization

2184
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,639
along with therapeutic touch to update

2185
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,679
someone's belief so you know i uh use

2186
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,719
with my clients sometimes ask them to

2187
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,880
depict how their

2188
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,719
their um

2189
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,520
injured shoulder what what image what

2190
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,040
vision vision do they get when they

2191
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,800
describe their injured shoulder compared

2192
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
to their healthy shoulder and

2193
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,120
you know one of them said um

2194
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,920
the the the bad shoulder feels like a

2195
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,440
rigid piece of

2196
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,000
guttering on a house that's gone frail

2197
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,679
in the sun whereas the good shoulder

2198
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,199
feels like

2199
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,320
gooey custard um it's nice and warm and

2200
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,199
then you know how can you transfer that

2201
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,920
belief about the injured the

2202
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,159
injured shoulder into the

2203
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,840
the gooey one so you know you've got

2204
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,320
some potential use of art therapy or

2205
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,960
even just visualization and symbols

2206
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,560
to um in combination with touch

2207
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,520
and movement and conversation

2208
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,639
um

2209
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,560
so yeah very awesome

2210
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,679
awesome

2211
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,760
and then um

2212
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,800
we have

2213
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,480
the open slide for 44.1 and 0.2 we're

2214
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,400
going to continue to add questions in

2215
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,400
the coming week and people can submit

2216
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,920
questions or

2217
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,560
participate live if they'd like

2218
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,440
i'm really interested to do some

2219
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,520
discussion of like what are the active

2220
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,679
inference entities that we're going to

2221
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:22,960
model

2222
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,120
is it the person okay then what are the

2223
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,760
sense states the action states what is

2224
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,159
the generative model that we're going to

2225
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,199
actually put on paper and so

2226
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,639
where does active inference come into

2227
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,239
play and how are we going to take the

2228
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,960
next step because so many threads have

2229
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,840
been brought together in this paper

2230
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,440
evidenced by the keywords and the

2231
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,159
bibliography and so on and then what is

2232
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,800
the next step who are the next

2233
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,080
audiences

2234
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,120
to update their cognitive model to think

2235
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,440
and act differently

2236
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,679
how does the clinical setting look

2237
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:58,719
different

2238
01:23:58,719 --> 01:23:59,520
in

2239
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,360
the active hospital

2240
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,480
or in the active exercise area or

2241
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
whatever it happens to be like what does

2242
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,679
the therapeutic alliance look like in an

2243
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,760
active inference model

2244
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,360
and what are the next steps for those

2245
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,839
who want to be engaged in that work

2246
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,520
and yeah we'll just continue to explore

2247
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,040
um

2248
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,120
what are some of your any

2249
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,760
closing-ish thoughts

2250
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,880
um

2251
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,719
yeah wonderful paper i'm really

2252
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,639
interested in you know how other

2253
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,320
um so this is written by

2254
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,120
uh a group of sort of people who

2255
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,000
is interested in osteopathy um

2256
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,159
the way i see it it could be applied to

2257
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,960
um talking therapies other hands-on

2258
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,480
therapies so is this a useful common

2259
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,360
language to understand lots of different

2260
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,440
already successful

2261
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,080
therapeutic approaches and interventions

2262
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,199
um

2263
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,800
that's one thing the other thing is you

2264
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,440
know how do we begin to

2265
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,120
um

2266
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,800
use some of the

2267
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,440
jargon that we might have been using now

2268
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,400
um

2269
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,440
how do we

2270
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,400
find a way to

2271
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,400
take the active inference um language to

2272
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,080
people who've never heard of active

2273
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,760
inferences before

2274
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,679
and then you know

2275
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,360
finally the uh

2276
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,880
something that came up without reading

2277
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,040
it's kind of an alternative hypothesis

2278
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,239
about

2279
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,000
this um

2280
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
you know assumption that

2281
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,840
synchrony and the therapeutic alliance

2282
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,600
will always result in

2283
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,520
minimizing free energy and you know i

2284
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,199
just had this thought

2285
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,759
what if

2286
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,719
um a you know uh

2287
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,400
within the therapeutic alliance a

2288
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,719
caregiver and the the patient agreed

2289
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,000
that

2290
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,400
they synchronized their

2291
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,639
quantum reference frame or whatever to

2292
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,000
um to say okay we're going to

2293
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,480
choose medically assisted dying here

2294
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,239
um is that still minimizing free energy

2295
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,440
or not

2296
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,520
um and is it helpful for the person is

2297
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,560
it soothing them you know

2298
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,840
so is it

2299
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,679
is it always minimizing free energy

2300
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,560
wow

2301
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,679
very

2302
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,040
deep with the

2303
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,280
birth and life control

2304
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,639
and the

2305
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,800
vital nature of what

2306
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,840
the therapeutic alliance truly is

2307
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,000
so

2308
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,239
also thanks for just this awesome

2309
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,600
discussion and all the zero slide making

2310
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,840
that we got to engage in

2311
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,639
so

2312
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,880
looking forward to the coming weeks of

2313
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,560
discussion

2314
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,920
talk to you later

2315
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,520
thank you very much daniel

2316
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,880
excellent see you later see you next

2317
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,840
week bye

2318
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,600
you
