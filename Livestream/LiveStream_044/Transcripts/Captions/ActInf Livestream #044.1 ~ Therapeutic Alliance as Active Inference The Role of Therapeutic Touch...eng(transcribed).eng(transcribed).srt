00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,399
hello and welcome everyone

3
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,480
it's may 18 2022 and we are in actin

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
flab live stream number 44.1 on the

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
therapeutic alliance as active inference

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
the role of therapeutic touch and

7
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,760
synchrony

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
welcome to the active lab we're a

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
participatory online lab that is

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
communicating learning and practicing

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
applied active inference you can find us

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
at the links on the slide this is a

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
recorded and an archived live stream so

14
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,399
please provide feedback so we can

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
improve our work

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,840
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
welcome and we'll be following video

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
etiquette for live streams

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,840
if you want to learn more about live

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
streams or any of the other projects

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,400
that are happening in the active lab

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
head over to activeinference.org

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
okay

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
today we're in live stream number 44.1

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,280
and we are learning and discussing

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
around this paper therapeutic alliance

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
as active inference by mcparlin

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
saratelli fristen and estevus and we're

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
really honored and appreciative to have

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
a bunch of authors joining us today and

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,200
also ian and ian and i did a zero last

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
week so for any context

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
one might want to check out the dot zero

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
otherwise in the dot one today and in

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
the dot two next week we're going to

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,119
open up and develop threads have the

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
opportunity to address any questions

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
that people are having in the live chat

39
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,119
or submitted to us otherwise and just

40
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,399
take notes and

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
have spontaneity and see where this goes

42
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
because it's a really exciting area of

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
research so we're just going to start

44
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,360
with that

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
um

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,959
all say hello and then pass to ian and

47
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,800
then we'll hear from the authors with

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
any context so

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
i'm a researcher in california and

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,319
was very interested in this

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
integration of a lot of perspectives

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,879
from like the ecological

53
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
and the developmental and kind of

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
bringing it towards practice which i

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,879
hope we can continue the discussion

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,720
around and i'll pass it to ian

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,519
thank you daniel um so my name's ian i

58
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,200
am based in england i work as a hands-on

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,839
manual therapist um have a background in

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
clinical and surgical sciences but also

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
do a little bit of research

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,360
now around the topic of interception and

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
this is where

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,360
um the work of these authors caught my

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
attention um the whole series actually

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
on inactivism and active inference it's

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,080
kind of where i've arrived at in the

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
last year

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
and i'm interested in

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
both how we talk about these ideas to

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,959
patients um

72
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,440
sort of in service of helping them

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
um

74
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
updates the meaning they sort of give to

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
their situation they're in

76
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,040
and also from a research point of view

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,080
you know

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
some how how we might be able to drive

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
forward some new questions in

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,080
research around health

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
thank you over to whoever's next

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,720
okay uh so i'm george estevez

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
i'm based between malta and italy uh i'm

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
an osteopath a researcher um

85
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
so my main interests uh are on

86
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
you know the things we're talking about

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,600
here today so inactivism active

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,720
inference

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
um

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
the sort of management of of of chronic

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,960
pain and complexity in clinical practice

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
a bit of background apart from from you

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
know osteopathy

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
my phd was exploring the role of

95
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,639
multi-sensory integration in

96
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,840
during palpation uh in osteopathy you

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
know

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
several moons ago so that's uh that was

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
my sort of

100
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,120
early dive into you know this kind of

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
world

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
and back in the sort of late 2000s when

103
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,320
people start talking about bayesian

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
models uh to explain multi-sensory

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,560
integration and so on so and that's

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,040
where where kind of things start from

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
hi i'm francesco uh

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
italian based in italy and thanks daniel

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
and ian for leading this

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
uh interesting

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
uh hopefully interesting live stream um

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,638
um

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
nostropod so handsome treatment and

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
also a neuroscientist

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
um so my main interest is in exploring

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
um effect of manual therapies within

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
the um

118
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
the uh the concept of interception and

119
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
the autonomy nervous system effects

120
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
that was my uh

121
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
basically my my main

122
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
streamline in the during the

123
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,919
my

124
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
phd

125
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
and then with george uh we um we

126
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
explored the uh

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
active inference and activism uh in the

128
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
last couple of years

129
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,280
and so uh and we're trying to also apply

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
in the context of therapeutic alliance

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
and different in different

132
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,319
um

133
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
age groups so starting from

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
the neonates preterms where actually we

135
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
have also

136
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,319
a big

137
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,280
quite a strong background and then into

138
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
uh ordered

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
persistent physical symptoms and also in

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,479
the other

141
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,560
age groups so that is the um so i'm just

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
divided into the clinical part and the

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
and the research

144
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,160
activities

145
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,240
thank you

146
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,270
sorry

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,960
[Music]

148
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,479
hi i'm zoe i'm the primary author on

149
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,199
this paper um again i am a osteopath and

150
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,080
um

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
this is my first paper that i've

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,440
published i originally started doing

153
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
a little bit of research on chronic pain

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
and how it affects autonomics a long

155
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,800
time ago um and then about two years ago

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
i reconnected with george on his

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
um active inference and

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
interceptive ideas

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,039
and since then we've kind of

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
gone from there and um this paper was

161
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
published we

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
i focus as an ostpath i'm mainly touch

163
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
based

164
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
um and so i wanted to do a paper based

165
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,639
on how touch

166
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
affects things and kind of have a little

167
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
bit more of the neuroscience behind what

168
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
we do

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
um so that's

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
and active imprint seemed the perfect

171
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
way to try and

172
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
justify things that maybe we

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
as osteopathic manual therapists maybe

174
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
feel but haven't been able to put down

175
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
um empirically on paper so that's how

176
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,479
the paper kind of started about

177
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,520
awesome

178
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
so again anyone in the live chat or

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
anyone here can just raise their hand or

180
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
ask a question but let's just jump in

181
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,879
right there like

182
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
that's really interesting about

183
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,639
using active inference for formalizing

184
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
some of the intuitions

185
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
and experiences that might be

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,039
felt during

187
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
the clinical setting so

188
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
what is the clinical setting

189
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
that you are engaged in or focusing on

190
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
and then what was that process of

191
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
recognizing

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
some experience and then how does active

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,440
inference fit in with formalizing that

194
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,000
[Music]

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
uh so

196
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
actually

197
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,040
you know a little bit of what i

198
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
mentioned before the sort of early

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,279
journey started with trying to explore

200
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
actually what we

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
what we do as osteopaths you know one of

202
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
the things or what we do as manual

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
therapies one of the things we do is we

204
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
first

205
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,519
there's a kind of the big claims about

206
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
what what we can do and what we can feel

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
and almost like having this sort of

208
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
magical sort of ability to

209
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,279
to recognize what's wrong with the

210
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
patient and that was always based around

211
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
this idea that

212
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
you know manual therapists or osteopaths

213
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
have superior abilities to to feel for

214
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
things you know palpation is really the

215
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,200
big thing

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
and based on on a kind of a paradigm

217
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
that's um

218
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
you know a little bit of old school

219
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,920
biomedically based biomechanically based

220
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
that

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
you know dysfunction altered mobility

222
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,680
for example equals pain equals problem

223
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,120
and of course

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
you know as the knowledge in the field

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
of pain science evolved we we started

226
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,440
realizing that's that's not the case you

227
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
know because you know what happens with

228
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
chronic pain is there is no longer a

229
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,519
tissue dysfunction in lots of cases but

230
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
there is pain so clearly it becomes

231
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
extremely difficult to find things find

232
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,200
things that actually are reliable

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
and and that's what the reliability is

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
is an observation and it's been one of

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
the big debates in the manual therapy

236
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
world which is we cannot reliably find

237
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
what we claim we can find so

238
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
poor typically poor interoperator

239
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
reliability two people cannot agree on

240
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,839
things and including also very poor

241
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,399
intra operator reliability you know i if

242
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,320
i test one thing and i retest that i

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
will not find the same thing and of

244
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
course you know this is

245
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
the kind of um

246
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
you know some some important things to

247
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,040
take into account

248
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
if the patient has a real pathology uh

249
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
for example uh a real joint

250
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,519
restrict restriction of movement for

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
example associated with severe arthritis

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
then you know one should find something

253
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
you know it's clearly there is is

254
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
objective but what happens in most of

255
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
the patients is what we claim to find

256
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
are things that are very qualitative in

257
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,560
nature very subjective so so the initial

258
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
kind of journey was really to try to

259
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,959
understand really what's going on and

260
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
hence the the idea of exploring things

261
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
from

262
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
a kind of multi-sensory perspective

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
uh clearly what we find or what we rely

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
as in the hands

265
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
uh it's not simply the haptic system of

266
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
the or you know somatosensory system

267
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
is a multi-sensory uh experience you

268
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
know we see we observe we touch we

269
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
change

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
we listen

271
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,880
and and that creates straight away

272
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
an environment where there's so many uh

273
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
variables that becomes extremely hard to

274
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
say yeah for sure

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
this is what i find so you know you you

276
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
can have people criticizing for this on

277
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
the sake of

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
the sake of criticizing or saying

279
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,839
everything is a kind of a it's an

280
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,200
illusion

281
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
to other people claiming no it's for

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
sure it's true and i think you know we

283
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
need to understand that actually

284
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
probably we sit in in between and more

285
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
than 10 years ago now i remember when i

286
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,079
kind of started presenting some of the

287
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,600
you know some of the research findings

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
to the to my profession

289
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,560
and implied the idea that actually

290
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
palpation is a construct of the brain

291
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
people got a little bit of yeah no no

292
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
can't be really because you know how can

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
you say that the hand is such a powerful

294
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,120
thing you know we we feel things

295
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
uh from a philosophical perspective

296
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,959
people were talking about you know the

297
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,200
hand is an extension of the brain so you

298
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
know clinical reasoning it kind of

299
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
continues through you know we gather we

300
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,839
gather sensory

301
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,519
evidence uh by listening by observing

302
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,200
the patient by

303
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
arguably using most of the senses

304
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
including smell because i don't think we

305
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
taste our patients but smell for sure

306
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
you know they are there cases where a

307
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
strong smell equals pathology so we get

308
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
that information we've been bombarded

309
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
with that information

310
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
and we try to make some sense of it and

311
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
you know it's it's it's down to the

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
clinical reasoning

313
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
so i think that fits nicely now with

314
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
with new ideas of you know along the

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
lines of active inference because

316
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
it's about you know active inference

317
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
claims about how we construct our own

318
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,160
sensorian you know how we

319
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,279
sort of

320
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,360
integrate information change things

321
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,680
proactively interact and so on exactly

322
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
what we do when

323
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,760
we assess a patient we touch we feel we

324
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,399
get a reaction from the patient either

325
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,480
you know that hurts or i don't like you

326
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
being touched or actually feels very

327
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,279
nice

328
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
so the number of things that straight

329
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
away are going to happen that

330
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
immediately one can argue changes the

331
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
outcome so it's no longer

332
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
you know what i felt now

333
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
the second guy is going to feel exactly

334
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
the same thing i don't think that is

335
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
possible unless of course if you've got

336
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
uh there's a there's a fused vertebra

337
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,959
between let's say c3 and c4 you know yes

338
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
we should feel the same thing because

339
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
objectively there is

340
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
there is a problem there

341
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
but otherwise you know what we tend to

342
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,399
find how we interact uh changes the

343
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,160
whole kind of environment and that i

344
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
think you know active inference um

345
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
it's kind of a nice framework to start

346
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
you know exploring things and uh rather

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
than just being on the on the negative

348
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
side is actually to try

349
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
and go a step further and try to

350
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
understand

351
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
you know

352
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
some of the dilemmas from a different

353
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,199
perspective from a different angle

354
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,040
without saying you know this justifies

355
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,639
now everything we do

356
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,560
far from that but actually try to

357
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
understand some more that

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
some of the difficulties some of the

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
tensions

360
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,920
yeah

361
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,040
may i

362
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,399
please right

363
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
so

364
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
definitely agree with what george uh

365
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
just said and what i would like to add

366
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
to the discussion table is that

367
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,279
um

368
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
actually we started also from um an

369
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,600
additional point there was the fact that

370
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
two additional points so the first one

371
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
is that apparently all manual all manual

372
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
therapies has got a an outcome

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
so it's got a positive outcomes for the

374
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
patients so that can be an osteoporo

375
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
there could be a physiotherapist it

376
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,399
could be chiropractor that could be

377
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,760
any a massage therapist so apparently

378
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
the uniqueness of each kind of

379
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
manual therapist

380
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
is a kind of flattened by the the

381
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
relationship that the that manual

382
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
therapist can establish with the patient

383
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
so giving therefore the importance of

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
the the type of relationship into you

385
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
with the with the with the patient they

386
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
might also play a big role in the

387
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
cleaning positive clinical outcome

388
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
effects

389
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
and the saturn is also related to the

390
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,839
fact that the

391
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,560
um based on quantitative quantitative

392
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
research

393
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,560
the

394
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
elements that actually pop up is that

395
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
some in some cases and more than some

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,720
cases the the specific application of

397
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
osteopathic treatment might also be

398
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
effective and with the clinical

399
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
effectiveness in it across different age

400
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,480
groups so from preterms to the elderly

401
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
to the

402
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,399
uh to olders and so on that actually

403
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
opens a very good question in regards to

404
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
the real effectiveness because actually

405
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
we know that from science that

406
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,959
that that it is not possible that we are

407
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
going to have always positive effects

408
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
otherwise we are going into publication

409
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,079
bias so we are going to publish only

410
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
the papers that actually are um are

411
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,759
positive towards that that kind of

412
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,360
um the kind of treatment so far so and

413
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,839
indeed in this way um

414
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,040
there might be therefore um the the need

415
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
for a paradigm shift

416
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
uh towards the as george said and

417
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,600
mentioned from the biomechanical way and

418
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,720
then

419
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,119
modified by the um

420
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
their bps so the

421
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
the bio psychological

422
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,799
um

423
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,799
the bio psychology the biopsychological

424
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,520
model into something that actually might

425
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
really take into account the environment

426
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
because in the indian

427
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,880
and these is also important because the

428
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,359
evolution of the free energy principle

429
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,640
and all the

430
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,799
the elements within

431
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
uh this content these contexts actually

432
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
take into account also elements then my

433
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
from a computational uh point of view

434
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,600
might take into account the relationship

435
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,480
between

436
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,280
uh people for example a mark of blankets

437
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,919
and the all the elements actually are in

438
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,520
contact between

439
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
the practitioner and any manual

440
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
practitioner in this case and the

441
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
patient

442
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
for for the sake of uh the the fact that

443
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
actually we are touching patients and

444
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,600
therefore it's a super powerful channels

445
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,720
that also with or without words might

446
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,320
also vehiculate and drive information

447
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,440
towards

448
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
a specific hand

449
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
now the other elements i would like to

450
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,720
introduce uh is the fact that sometimes

451
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
happened that we

452
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
consider the reliability a inter

453
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,039
reliability between the manual therapies

454
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,720
perspective some

455
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
a big problem but this problem is

456
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
actually exactly the same for

457
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
cardiologists for uh people in the uh

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
doing ultrasound

459
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,600
why is that because actually it's

460
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,960
the uh and was a paper a beautiful paper

461
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,160
publishing on bmj probably 10 years ago

462
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
talking about the the kind of

463
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
statistical measure that actually has

464
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,400
been used for reliability studies and

465
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,600
mainly is the decay coin scale

466
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,720
that is one an intrinsic problem with

467
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,559
coins k because actually it doesn't take

468
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,640
into account what is the reality of the

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
measurement of the

470
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,760
uh the radiologists or the radiologists

471
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
are measuring the ultrasound ultrasound

472
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
specialist manual therapies and so on so

473
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,880
it's been implied therefore that that

474
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
time that kind of the reliability it's

475
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
one of the

476
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,520
most important measurement for

477
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
reproducing and for

478
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,120
generalizing the the uh what actually

479
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,919
the treatment is is doing and with this

480
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
framework actually we are trying to get

481
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,039
out from this perspective because within

482
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
the the context of a therapeutic

483
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,520
alliance and when actually we take into

484
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,640
account where we where we look after

485
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
patients it's not just the fact that

486
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
actually we can uh reproduce the

487
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
treatment because the treatment is just

488
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
one element of the plethora of the the

489
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,320
broad elements of the of the of the uh

490
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,640
of the instruments and tools

491
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,000
that the

492
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,600
within the the session we are applying

493
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,480
so it's just a reducing like a funnel

494
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
the fact that actually we need to

495
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,120
reproduce the exactly that that kind of

496
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,159
uh

497
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,960
dysfunction or problems in the in the

498
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,520
column but the problem in the column

499
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
might be also affected the way in which

500
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
we establish a relationship with the

501
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
patient so and it goes and back in the

502
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
days the bmj paper was

503
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,919
just uh um a brilliant uh way of looking

504
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
at the one of these main effects uh from

505
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,480
a different perspective

506
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
thank you awesome zoe

507
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
yeah so to add on to uh what george and

508
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
francesco said this paper mainly focuses

509
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,200
on more private practice than um sort of

510
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
a hospital setting obviously it can it's

511
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
a framework so it can be applied but

512
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
generally we're talking about more

513
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,880
dyadic or triadic relationships within

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
clinic um

515
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
as as the setting

516
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
um and we've primarily focused on manual

517
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
therapy but it the theories of active

518
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,640
influence and everything can be applied

519
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,120
to others like psychotherapy and things

520
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
like that as well

521
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,520
um just to point that out but yes like

522
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
francesco and george said we're mainly

523
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
using touch as

524
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,919
sort of the vehicle but there's a lot

525
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,440
more that's going on

526
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
sort of with the way that we communicate

527
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,679
and the different aspects of

528
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,240
like the biopsychosocial model which now

529
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
i'm sort of expanding upon but there's a

530
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,960
lot more to it than just the vehicle of

531
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
touch to make therapeutic alliance um i

532
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
think the therapeutic alliance is

533
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
interesting there's a lot of research

534
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,080
that's been done for a very long time on

535
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
the therapeutic alliance itself what it

536
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,440
is and why it's important but there's

537
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
not actually

538
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
that many theories to the sort of the

539
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
neuroscience or things like active

540
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
influence behind

541
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
why it's important all the research will

542
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,559
tell you that you can get better

543
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,080
clinical results

544
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
and better relationships better trust

545
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,039
with the patients more adherence lots of

546
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
different positive effects of the

547
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,280
therapeutic alliance but not always

548
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
um sort of explaining how the

549
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
therapeutic alliance works

550
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
um or how to best achieve it that's kind

551
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,200
of not always

552
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
um expressed so this is kind of a way

553
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
that we've tried to quantify

554
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
how to

555
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
affect um to gather all the different um

556
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,799
parts of the that go on to create the

557
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,320
therapeutic alliance instead of one

558
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,070
framework

559
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,559
[Music]

560
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
awesome a lot there ian do you have any

561
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,360
thing to add or i'll ask you a question

562
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,640
um yes thank you well

563
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
lots of tantalizing stuff there and you

564
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
know what i really love is the

565
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
openness of all of this

566
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
question asking um

567
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,679
several sort of things from the paper

568
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
that or topics from the paper i'd like

569
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
to explore but one thing that's coming

570
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,039
out to me now um is this

571
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,240
role of the

572
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,159
expert and the model of the expert that

573
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,679
might be leading where things are

574
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,159
synchronizing towards between the

575
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
therapeutic alliance and um so what i'm

576
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
sort of

577
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
came to mind as i was hearing that is

578
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
sometimes is it the

579
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
patient that's the expert or allowing

580
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
the patient to be the expert

581
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
or taking turns in being the expert so

582
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
you know it might be the the

583
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,919
therapist says oh you know

584
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,960
based on my model my you know my past

585
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
experience my priors that my the

586
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,760
palpation that we're doing now makes me

587
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,679
think maybe it's the tightness in your

588
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
traps that's causing this pain but then

589
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
actually you know the patient says

590
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,279
you know takes on the role of the expert

591
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,279
and says based on my prize actually you

592
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,679
know i've often had tight traps and it's

593
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,760
never been a problem and i'm actually

594
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
what i'm feeling is

595
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
maybe

596
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,799
nausea in my stomach because of all this

597
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
exam pressure i've got or

598
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
stress with my

599
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
family members and then you know then

600
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,039
there's another cycle of experts

601
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,679
swapping over and exploration so it's

602
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,880
more of a exploration the touch is um

603
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
helping with exploration of

604
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
the

605
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,559
models between

606
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
the you know the co embodiment between

607
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
the the patient and the

608
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,120
the practitioner

609
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,159
the other thing you know when you were

610
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,279
talking about the machines in the

611
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
hospital the radiologist or the mri

612
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
scanner um

613
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,919
i was thinking also about the

614
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,640
you know the hand as a machine and

615
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
a blind person builds up this

616
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
sensitivity to be able to read braille

617
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,720
um so they're palpating a piece of paper

618
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
with braille on it and maybe it says

619
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,039
john went to the shops and bought an

620
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,919
apple but the blind person would never

621
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880
you know look at that pattern and think

622
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
um

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,919
that there's a person called john eating

624
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,360
an apple inside the paper uh but they

625
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,039
you know the but the symbols that

626
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
they're being created as they feel that

627
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
they'll see an image of

628
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,880
an apple and john and maybe it'll bring

629
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,480
up feelings and emotions and i just

630
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
wonder if sometimes you know it's

631
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
confusing

632
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,160
the sensory input with the

633
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,640
[Music]

634
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
feelings and how do we overcome

635
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
the feelings and the images and how do

636
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
we overcome that and you know not

637
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
confuse the moon with the finger

638
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,360
pointing at it

639
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,720
um

640
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,279
so yeah lots lots of lots of questions

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,440
please

642
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
look

643
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
okay

644
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
um

645
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
it's they're very good questions by the

646
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
way

647
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
i think that the whole issue about

648
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,279
taking turns i think

649
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,320
it's

650
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,799
it should be the essence of it uh one

651
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,279
cannot argue that

652
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
it's always the expert as a practitioner

653
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
if we do that i think you know we end up

654
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,559
in a situation where

655
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
um clinical practice relies on that

656
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
expert the top-down kind of approach i

657
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
know best because i'm the healthcare

658
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,080
professional healthcare provider and

659
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,559
therefore um you know i know what's

660
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,400
wrong with you that's that's kind of the

661
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
that's away from the a model of

662
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
person-centered care one expects really

663
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
that

664
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
practitioner and patients or

665
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,360
zoe alluded to the concept of a triadic

666
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
relationship

667
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
where for example in pediatric care

668
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
there's a baby there and this is a

669
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,919
conversation with the mother or the

670
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,400
father or sometimes in geriatric care

671
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
there's a conversation with the you know

672
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,760
with

673
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,679
for example the daughter or the son or

674
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,600
the older person and so on so that

675
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,320
taking in turns i think they are clearly

676
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,080
uh we need to think about the person is

677
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
expert in their own body and i

678
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
personally tend to ask my patients you

679
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
know what in your opinion what you think

680
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
is wrong with you

681
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
you know ultimately you are the expert

682
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
in your own body

683
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,120
and clearly if it's something kind of

684
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
new uh

685
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,600
you know the system becomes uh

686
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
better detecting something that you know

687
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
what's going on here

688
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
uh kind of you know something that

689
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,760
requires some attention but clearly when

690
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
when in in cases for example of chronic

691
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,080
pain the system becomes extremely good

692
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
relying on the price on the very strong

693
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,039
generative model too so yeah this is

694
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
pretty much what always happens when i

695
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,559
get stressed

696
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
you know i typically get you know start

697
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,760
worrying about i start getting some

698
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,320
butterflies in my tummy and so on and

699
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,919
then you know from that is just a

700
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,080
cascade of events that ultimately leads

701
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,720
to my headaches or my neck pain and so

702
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,520
on so i think you know clearly one

703
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
cannot talk about you know the person

704
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
the practitioner being the expert

705
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
having said that there are times where

706
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
clearly uh you need to play the role of

707
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,840
the expert you know i don't think you

708
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,240
know we need to simply just rely

709
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
on the person on the patient because

710
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,240
also that's why they're consulting us

711
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
you know if they if they also notice

712
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,000
there is a sometimes a little bit of ex

713
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
you know uh uncertainty about what you

714
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
think is going on uh this thing about

715
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
you know it's a beautiful beautiful

716
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
thing about clinical practice about

717
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,679
clinical uncertainty

718
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,480
but humans hate uncertainty anyway our

719
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,840
brains don't like

720
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,640
uncertainty anyway so you want to know

721
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,919
come on stop

722
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,000
stop talking about could be x y and z

723
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
and just tell me what's going on because

724
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
in the cases of complexity that's what

725
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,919
tends to generate that

726
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,919
that sort of vicious circle where the

727
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,000
guy goes to dr google then goes to the

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399
next practitioner and you you end up

729
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,360
with a fascinating uh situation

730
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,080
sometimes a person becomes cognitively

731
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,120
immune to any new explanations because

732
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
hey i guess you know guess what you know

733
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,760
i've been talking to a lot of

734
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
practitioners nobody knows what's wrong

735
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
with me

736
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,399
and you know yes but you know you're the

737
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,679
expert so it is a a kind of something we

738
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,120
need to manage very uh you know

739
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
very well and and in a clever way and i

740
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,559
think that comes from

741
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,000
creating the

742
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
the environment where

743
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,799
listening uh

744
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,000
observing

745
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,159
a lot of what's not said but actually is

746
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,559
observed in terms of

747
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,720
the body language

748
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,840
is critical uh also to know when to

749
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,679
when to chip in and say something when

750
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,679
to sometimes just

751
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,679
shut down and let the whole thing let

752
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,600
them talk or let them not say anything

753
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,320
and

754
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,039
and you know and treat for example say

755
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,720
i think that that that's part of it uh

756
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,039
regarding the other stuff and we can you

757
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,200
know carry on with this pretty sure the

758
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
other guys will have fascinating ideas

759
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,840
um i think that the mental images are

760
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
part of everything you know you know you

761
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,679
you're talking about you know the the

762
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,559
blind person reading braille and so on

763
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,120
the early studies looking for some form

764
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,200
of plasticity in v1 and so on

765
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
even with congenitally blind

766
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,840
people they found that there was an

767
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
element of kind of possibly imagery

768
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,039
there's a road map so i don't think you

769
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,960
can dissociate yourself from the images

770
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,679
you create when you uh

771
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,200
when you're navigating the world when

772
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
you're interacting with the world and a

773
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,520
very strong kind of uh prior to what

774
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,880
we're going to

775
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,039
you know put my hand but i accept then

776
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,919
of course that that that prior is going

777
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,240
to bias the you know the incoming signal

778
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and it's going to match some obvious yes

779
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
of course this is what it is so images

780
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
are done i think we just need to cope

781
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
with that

782
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
well what i cannot do what just george

783
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,760
said uh is that uh when observing

784
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,159
someone in the i mean in the clinical

785
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,000
practice actually

786
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,600
the one element might be to start

787
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,159
understanding the generative models

788
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,240
so the and

789
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
understanding the generative models

790
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
means that in addition to what george

791
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
said also how

792
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,559
for example the body reacts to

793
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,760
specific

794
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,679
uh steam to specific stimuli so also

795
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,919
testing in the clinical practice the

796
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,000
generative model might also give us the

797
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,440
idea on how the body might react from

798
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,039
different stimuli to uh in in for

799
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,000
example

800
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,200
um combining different senses so they

801
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
might be

802
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
so talking how the

803
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,919
talking about for example the pain might

804
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,799
change the generation generative models

805
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,840
in the body for example so uh are there

806
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
are some parts getting

807
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,919
tighter or

808
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:56,799
more

809
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,840
real

810
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,640
what happened or for example

811
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
talking about or touching in specific

812
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,960
areas how or moving the the the body in

813
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
a specific way how those generative

814
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,120
models might change

815
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,600
so and i think it's important in the in

816
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
the role play that we that the patient

817
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
and the the practitioner are

818
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,440
uh are establishing during the

819
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,399
therapeutic alliance and i think and we

820
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,200
discussed that also with george then

821
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
the the right balance between the input

822
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,559
the giving the

823
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,679
um this role to the patient and

824
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
to the practitioners also it's important

825
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
for establishing a good therapeutic

826
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,960
therapeutic alliance why is that because

827
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
actually the patient the patient as

828
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
mentioned by zoe in a way

829
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,039
uh needs trust and trust may be also uh

830
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
um might be also applied

831
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,120
bi-directionally so in the way that

832
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
actually the patient coming into our

833
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
clinical practice actually they are just

834
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,159
giving us trust so they

835
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,279
by by default saying okay i'm coming to

836
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,840
you because i trust you and because i

837
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,799
think you can ask me so that it's a way

838
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
of uh sharing trust but on the other

839
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,640
side the clinician needs also to trust

840
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
the patient about what he or she said or

841
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,360
what he or she uh shared and in these

842
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,720
kind of uh dichotomous uh role play i

843
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,279
think it's important the the fact that

844
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,640
the we need to uh understand and improve

845
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,080
our ability of uh taking turns

846
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,039
uh and from that of obviously creating

847
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,919
the right the right environment

848
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
on the other on the other um question so

849
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,120
uh the braille yes uh mental images are

850
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
always there but also mental images are

851
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
not just visual because actually they

852
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,399
can

853
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,200
during the the secondary and and and

854
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,159
third

855
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,519
um

856
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
i mean the the uh the in the evolution

857
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
of the of the sensations and the

858
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,040
feelings uh actually are not just

859
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,320
compartmentalizing to one um one image

860
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
so the visual part because actually then

861
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,359
are also um

862
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,359
characterized by other

863
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,839
other elements that actually comes from

864
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,159
experience but also comes from our

865
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,639
expectations so what we expect about

866
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
those mental images

867
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,918
um you know in addition to that there is

868
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,000
a difference between just you just to

869
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,440
pick up a very um um

870
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,079
a very interesting point uh

871
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
raised by ian that the uh one of the

872
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,760
last paper from

873
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,960
carvalho carvalho and um damascus

874
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
published in 2000

875
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,560
at the end of 2021 actually they where

876
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,399
they proposed the

877
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,359
interoceptic nervous system and not just

878
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,560
the interception as part of the

879
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,079
uh the the different uh aspects of uh

880
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,079
the the perception

881
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,839
when actually they proposed that they

882
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
also said that when actually we are

883
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
gonna have the extra receptive map and

884
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
interoceptic mapping within the brain it

885
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
actually comes from from the senses from

886
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,920
external senses but also from internal

887
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
sensitivity interception

888
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,160
after the process of integrating them

889
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040
into

890
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
the the brain actually then and driving

891
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
two things the first one is feelings and

892
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,640
the other one the other one is drives so

893
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
the drives are is the elements that

894
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,119
actually are creating the substances for

895
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,079
creating their four feelings so are the

896
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,520
main elements that create therefore

897
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,800
the the the consciousness of what we are

898
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,920
feeding so far and and then uh in

899
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,000
addition to that when actually they are

900
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,560
creating those elements that actually go

901
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,079
back into

902
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,880
uh

903
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
and the the very nice special issue on

904
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
interception published on new on

905
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,480
on neuroscience as uh always last year

906
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
where actually these concepts this model

907
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,079
of intercepting model was then

908
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,119
modified into the homeostatic

909
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,520
inter homeostatic model

910
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,240
where we get into account the fact that

911
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,960
actually we have the interception is

912
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,920
creating therefore the object of what we

913
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,079
are feeling and then there is the

914
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,320
subject that is the brain that actually

915
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,119
are creating a perspective of what is

916
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,839
the interception and then there is the

917
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,640
the the final part the is the mental

918
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,280
imaging of our interest on intercepting

919
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,079
condition and therefore everything

920
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
uh or therefore everything so the mental

921
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,359
images might be also checked with the

922
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,440
real what actually is coming from the

923
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,160
tissue and this model is called model of

924
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
forecasting so creating therefore the

925
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
elements between these two uh ideals so

926
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
the prior with the like and the

927
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
likelihood just to talk about something

928
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,839
in the uh from

929
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,359
a fep

930
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,800
perspective so in what creating what

931
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
what is usually called the the posterior

932
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,760
so i think that the mental images from

933
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,320
one side from the brain from the brain

934
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,599
side and the braille side are then

935
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,280
checked with something that is the

936
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,160
perception of the the blind the blind

937
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,400
man that actually is touching the

938
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
the uh

939
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,320
the bar with the different spots and

940
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,720
then they are forecasting the the the

941
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,599
two elements in order to create a mental

942
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,320
image yesterday is a kind of a rainbow

943
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
so with different colors with different

944
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
elements inside

945
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,240
in order to understand what is behind

946
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,800
that that the story that

947
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,079
he or she is reading

948
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,079
awesome

949
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,920
again a lot to kind of pick up on but

950
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,160
just the way that the expectations play

951
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,720
into what is palpated even just at a

952
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,599
primary sensory level like anyone might

953
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,320
be able to run their finger and detect a

954
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,200
bump

955
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,839
but then one level of expertise is that

956
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,920
integration of well where should the

957
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,440
bumps be

958
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,599
or what does this mean in this person's

959
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,560
clinical trajectory and so

960
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,599
it isn't just um the information flowing

961
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,359
into the person doing the perceiving

962
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,839
it's this active palpation in the

963
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,880
integration of decades of the person's

964
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
experience

965
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
in the clinical setting

966
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,200
and then the person's experience within

967
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
that body and then this externalized

968
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,920
knowledge resource that we

969
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,800
call like empirical grounding of science

970
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
and evidence-based medicine

971
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,520
and then all of that like comes together

972
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,040
in the focus of the therapeutic alliance

973
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
and in the clinical setting that's like

974
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,680
the run time where all these features

975
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
intersect

976
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,920
and

977
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
it's just very interesting how we're

978
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
seeing a lot of these threads like you

979
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,000
you use the the bayesian terminology

980
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,720
like the prior it's the expectations and

981
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,800
then there's like the observations and

982
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
then those are updated to form a

983
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,440
posterior connecting that kind of

984
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
quantitative approach to thinking about

985
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,760
perception cognition and then even

986
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
action selection with the intermodal

987
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,359
it's like well

988
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,079
even if only that to combine the past

989
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,520
present and future

990
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,280
with multiple

991
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
sensations and types of sensations and

992
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,280
cognitive features like memory and

993
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,640
preference

994
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,200
that would be excellent for active to do

995
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,640
and so that um

996
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
is a really clear how it's presented in

997
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,119
the paper in here like what active

998
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,960
inference is doing

999
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,720
in in this um

1000
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,359
focused setting of that

1001
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,880
dyadic

1002
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
initially touched grounded

1003
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,680
um

1004
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
relationship but then yeah

1005
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
maybe there's another machine involved

1006
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
maybe somebody is using an x-ray scanner

1007
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,240
or they're using a temperature by a

1008
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
thermometer that just becomes another

1009
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,599
observation

1010
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,640
another

1011
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,040
mere active inference or adaptive active

1012
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
inference entity in this multi-attic

1013
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,760
relationship

1014
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,839
so really interesting

1015
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,680
i think if i can

1016
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,880
add

1017
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,599
one

1018
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,079
one interesting thing to to the debate

1019
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,200
is

1020
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,079
in recent times we've been been

1021
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
observing quite a lot of debate around

1022
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,680
you know what's what's the value of

1023
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,880
palpation you know why why bother

1024
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,359
because you know palpation is typically

1025
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,079
does have that connotation of biomedical

1026
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,760
kind of approach you know looking for

1027
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,000
something that is dysfunctional some

1028
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
pathology and so on i think

1029
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
one important thing is you know from

1030
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,599
this perspective i think would be

1031
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,000
important to take into account is

1032
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,800
palpation still matters even if it's

1033
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,480
just as a way of communicating as a way

1034
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,920
of reassuring

1035
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,359
as a way of of actually contributing to

1036
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,440
to the development of that therapeutic

1037
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
niche so it's not just uh

1038
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,880
it is this sort of palpation not being a

1039
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,240
one-way stream where i kind of look for

1040
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,319
what's wrong and i know what's wrong but

1041
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,560
actually the dialogue and

1042
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,280
that dialogue can involve of course

1043
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,040
finding you know something

1044
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,079
that is

1045
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,440
you know not

1046
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,680
not good you know potentially even

1047
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
pathological to something that actually

1048
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,880
you know that that that exploration

1049
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,640
actually feels nice and comforts the

1050
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,160
patient and so on so

1051
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
it is important not just sort of be on a

1052
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,359
on a kind of very um fundamentalist

1053
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,680
approach is either one thing or another

1054
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
but actually try to kind of you know sit

1055
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,839
in the middle and try to to observe the

1056
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,760
two sides and even the tensions between

1057
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,920
the two sides you know biomedically

1058
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,359
based or

1059
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,680
more so to exploratory more sort of

1060
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
niche construction more sort of active

1061
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
inference in nature

1062
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,670
thank you sorry

1063
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,480
[Music]

1064
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,359
um yes so i think back to the expertise

1065
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,160
i just wanted to add in about um

1066
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,720
we brought up the concept of a bird song

1067
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,560
and i think that's kind of how

1068
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,920
i see it as expertise i would never tell

1069
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,599
a patient

1070
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,280
personally that they are not the

1071
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,440
expertise in their pain

1072
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,920
i don't know what they're feeling in and

1073
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,280
their priors and different things that

1074
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,520
are going on to make them their pain i

1075
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,040
would always say that my patient is an

1076
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,280
expert in what they're feeling in their

1077
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,720
pain whatever

1078
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
that may mean to them um i would say

1079
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,920
that they are the expert in that but i

1080
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,760
think it's it's a bird song it's a

1081
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,640
taking here it's it's it's

1082
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
you're sort of adapting what you think

1083
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,839
yes often as a practitioner you're seen

1084
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,599
as more of the

1085
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,880
expert or your precision of maybe the

1086
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,560
physiological side of the condition is

1087
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,400
more precise than

1088
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,079
what your patient is they've obviously

1089
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
not 100 certain what's going on

1090
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,640
otherwise maybe they wouldn't be coming

1091
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,680
but i think it's definitely

1092
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,160
you adapt what you think based on what

1093
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,000
your patient is feeling and what they

1094
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,640
say if you may think one certain thing

1095
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,319
and then they might tell you that

1096
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,839
actually you know they did this at the

1097
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,599
weekend or

1098
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,480
they felt this or this happened before

1099
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,040
and you kind of constantly change

1100
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,119
and take it you adapt your idea a little

1101
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,119
bit you adapt their idea a little bit

1102
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,119
the whole diagnostic process is

1103
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,720
generally not

1104
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,880
cut and dry i mean some situations are

1105
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,119
but generally speaking we do not know

1106
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,560
100 what is going on um in in a clinical

1107
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,040
space without machines or without sort

1108
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
of more in-depth knowledge we're going

1109
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,119
based on what we think um in our opinion

1110
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
so i think it is definitely

1111
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,200
there's no strict hierarchy in terms of

1112
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
you are just the practitioner is just

1113
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,240
the expert yeah we may be the expert on

1114
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,560
one aspect of the condition but not

1115
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,640
necessarily the aspect on

1116
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,280
the whole big picture once you take into

1117
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,640
account all the other things that

1118
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,200
contribute to their pain

1119
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,880
it's not just

1120
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,839
a

1121
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,079
physiological response

1122
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,040
often as the whole

1123
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,640
to be in sort of an overload of

1124
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,200
aliastasis you've got to have

1125
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
a lot more than just

1126
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,760
pain there's a reason why behind there's

1127
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,280
a certain few things that probably have

1128
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,359
gone on for them to be in that situation

1129
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,440
so i think it's it's too simple to say

1130
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,640
that that you're just the expert because

1131
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
you've done a degree and you're meant to

1132
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
know

1133
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,119
sort of the biomechanics or the

1134
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,440
physiology behind a certain condition

1135
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,119
um as for

1136
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,720
what everyone um

1137
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
was saying after towards the braille and

1138
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,000
feeling

1139
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,480
touch is there's a lot of research to

1140
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,560
show that touch is intraceptive it

1141
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,920
affects the um and activates the insula

1142
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,880
which

1143
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,040
gives you sort of that connection

1144
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,920
between what you're feeling um your what

1145
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,640
sensory stimulus you're detecting and

1146
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,200
the feeling that you contribute to that

1147
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,000
so

1148
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,359
that's why

1149
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,359
sometimes we have a touch and we feel

1150
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,640
it's pleasant

1151
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,560
um it's that effect of the insular and

1152
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,040
how it is processed and i think that's

1153
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
obviously dependent on

1154
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,720
the individual different people will

1155
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
have different things that will

1156
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,359
make certain things feel more pleasant

1157
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,079
or more painful depending on

1158
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,720
lots of different aspects and so

1159
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,280
i think we touched upon sort of touches

1160
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,680
a way of a good way of non

1161
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,720
nonverbal communication of expressing

1162
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,359
not just examining the condition but

1163
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,240
also

1164
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
showing that you understand through sort

1165
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,839
of empathy and things like that so

1166
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,359
you

1167
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,440
you can use touch to show what you're

1168
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,960
feeling without saying i think this is

1169
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,240
something that

1170
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,200
is very evident with the pandemic i mean

1171
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,560
there's a lot of people that went

1172
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,400
through a lot of hard times and the one

1173
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,319
thing they wanted to do of everything

1174
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,680
was just give

1175
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,400
the person they loved a hug or

1176
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,280
you know they people missed funerals and

1177
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,480
weddings and

1178
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,119
lots of different sort of events

1179
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,400
significant events in other people's

1180
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,960
lives and all people wanted to do was

1181
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,000
just

1182
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,280
you know

1183
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,440
hug the person if they just lost someone

1184
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,200
so i think

1185
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,520
touch has a way of

1186
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,119
communicating with people on a different

1187
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,440
level than not just

1188
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
sort of the

1189
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,078
purely clinical level

1190
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,649
[Music]

1191
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,040
thank you and um yeah just followed on

1192
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,440
from what zoe said it reminded me daniel

1193
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,200
of um

1194
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,560
the example you took from the very

1195
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,400
beginning of the new active inference

1196
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,079
manual of um

1197
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,200
you know

1198
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
putting your finger on your thigh and

1199
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,160
saying

1200
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,079
is this rough or smooth and you have to

1201
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,000
kind of uh

1202
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,839
you have to move your hand to tell if

1203
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,839
it's rough or smooth and then i'm

1204
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,160
thinking about you know animals preening

1205
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,440
themselves

1206
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,359
so preening each other or grooming each

1207
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,839
other and you know

1208
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,680
proposing here from an evolutionary

1209
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,839
point of view

1210
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,599
we've um been able we've found this way

1211
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,440
of distinguishing between

1212
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
um you know a nice smooth something

1213
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,359
smooth and soft

1214
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
that's supportive and bonding and packed

1215
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,160
like animals building a pack

1216
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
together versus something that's more

1217
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,480
like a fight or a clash or

1218
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,880
um conflict

1219
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,079
and um

1220
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
you know that in the paper you you

1221
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,839
talked about um

1222
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,160
we're coming arriving at this sort of

1223
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,480
insight that we're all identical i think

1224
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,240
it was or very similar

1225
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,680
so that brings me back to

1226
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,839
something like safety and

1227
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,040
um

1228
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,680
a likeness and not reject the role of

1229
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,040
touch in

1230
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
um

1231
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,559
feeling part of

1232
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,359
a pack or a tribe versus

1233
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,800
um being rejected or outcast or fought

1234
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,680
away

1235
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,839
so yeah you know that role of touch in

1236
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,160
reassuring that everything's okay we are

1237
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,640
similar um

1238
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,599
the other thing what uh um francesco's

1239
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,119
left but he talked about the

1240
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,119
understanding the generative model and

1241
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,559
as he was talking about that i was

1242
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,400
thinking about

1243
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
i don't know if anyone's um

1244
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,040
come across something called hakomi

1245
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,960
it's a form of group

1246
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,280
but can be done group or individual work

1247
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,920
where a bit like somatic experiencing

1248
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,960
where the participants

1249
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,559
um

1250
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,559
try and understand in a sort of

1251
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,480
reflective listening each of what's

1252
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,559
going on inside each other so try and

1253
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,160
explore each other's

1254
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,040
interceptive world plus also what might

1255
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,200
be going on in their outside life

1256
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,680
and i remember hearing about performing

1257
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
little experiments so the person who

1258
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
takes on the role of the expert kind of

1259
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,640
says okay

1260
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
let's do a little experiment here what

1261
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,599
happens if

1262
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,400
you know what happens if you

1263
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,200
say this or do this or take this action

1264
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
what does that do to your

1265
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,720
your experience

1266
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,640
and you know i think that's kind of what

1267
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,559
happens anyway in therapy you know

1268
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,800
physiotherapists will give people a list

1269
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,359
of exercises and say you know do this

1270
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,839
experiment and hopefully i i hope that

1271
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,160
you'll get better um but i'm just

1272
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,599
wondering with this sort of paradigm

1273
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,640
shift of

1274
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,319
uh

1275
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,599
the physiotherapist just being the

1276
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,240
expert and prescribing something that's

1277
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,160
definitely gonna work it's more framed

1278
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,280
as okay you know i'd like to encourage

1279
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,839
the patient to be more experimental um

1280
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,839
rather than just be prescribed something

1281
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,359
whilst appreciating what you said you're

1282
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,480
get your uh george about um

1283
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,559
you know they they actually come wanting

1284
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,960
their hope to be guided in a certain way

1285
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,480
so you know we need we need to have a

1286
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,720
certain level of confidence and guiding

1287
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
but not necessarily

1288
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,680
being too prescriptive

1289
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,040
um

1290
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,640
now the the thing about you know the

1291
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,200
generative modellings and how we can

1292
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,800
change things

1293
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,319
uh

1294
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,000
so for example you know these two

1295
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,920
two sides are the same equation i would

1296
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,680
say uh

1297
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,160
one is when you for example in patients

1298
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,599
with um

1299
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,920
as you phobia fear of movements when you

1300
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,599
ask them you know for example you know

1301
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,480
can you perform this kind of action

1302
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
typically for low back pain most people

1303
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,240
are scared of

1304
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,000
bending forward going into flexion

1305
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,079
because it's typically associated that's

1306
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,720
how my disc is gonna pop and that's how

1307
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,480
you know i ended up in this situation

1308
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,960
and so on so uh

1309
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,119
you know putting in you know

1310
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,440
perceiving a little bit of that of that

1311
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,319
generative model which could be one of

1312
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,680
you know

1313
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,319
moving forward going into flexion equals

1314
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,359
pain

1315
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,160
uh you sometimes just by telling okay

1316
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
let's try to do this movement and

1317
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,079
before the patient actually starts doing

1318
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,400
the movement you find straight away an

1319
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
immediate muscle guarding you know

1320
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,559
is a sort of oh yeah you know i can't do

1321
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
that that's that's hurting straight away

1322
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,200
and and in fact you find sometimes that

1323
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,960
muscle guarding so you know where does

1324
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,160
palpation actually come into the

1325
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,760
equation you know rather than being

1326
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,599
diagnostic you can actually

1327
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,280
also look at you know what's going on

1328
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,680
you know so to try to align our mental

1329
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
states with them and predict what's

1330
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,720
probably going on

1331
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,800
going on now from an active inference

1332
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,880
perspective you could argue that if they

1333
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,440
believe them of the the priors is very

1334
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,480
strong that flexion equals spine

1335
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,280
it's likely that kind of a minimal

1336
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
a minimal sensory input

1337
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,280
is likely to

1338
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,160
create that muscle spasm and therefore

1339
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,000
yes i knew i would do this and it would

1340
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,400
be in pain okay so that's what sometimes

1341
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,480
we we observe and actually if you start

1342
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
thinking about some of the

1343
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,280
some of the clinical signs and symptoms

1344
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,880
you find with patients with persistent

1345
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,480
pain for example in people you know

1346
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,040
either catastrophization or you know is

1347
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,400
a phobia and actually putting through

1348
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,319
this perspective you can argue that you

1349
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,240
know what's probably likely to be very

1350
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,800
strong is a generative model sometimes

1351
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,040
with movement or this type of action

1352
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,440
equals damage therefore

1353
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,839
i have more pain how can we

1354
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,000
short-circuit the whole thing how can we

1355
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,040
start

1356
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
changing a little bit of that

1357
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,800
generative model sort of in a sense

1358
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,480
creating a prediction error that is so

1359
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,559
great that actually surprises that

1360
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,720
the system um

1361
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,440
so for example you know one could

1362
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,599
use for example breathing or focusing on

1363
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,920
some interceptive sensations that's

1364
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,599
that's been used by other practitioners

1365
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,880
for example

1366
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,440
in um in many you know musculoskeletal

1367
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
care the concept of cognitive functional

1368
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,559
uh

1369
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,359
you know um therapy is based a little

1370
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,200
bit on that for example using breathing

1371
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,040
asking the patient to sort of focus a

1372
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,319
little bit on your breathing take a deep

1373
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,400
breath in relax and not try to move the

1374
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,240
movement again and you find that

1375
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,599
sometimes you know there is an

1376
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,440
improvement on a few ranges you know and

1377
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,839
you know degrees of range of motion

1378
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,599
but arguably if you think from this

1379
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,119
perspective actually you started

1380
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,880
changing the model say oh patient

1381
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
sometimes looks at you so

1382
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,680
that actually feels a little bit easier

1383
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,079
how come what have you done you didn't

1384
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,160
do anything you started sort of uh you

1385
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,000
created this you know surprised the

1386
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,599
system okay

1387
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,200
and you surprise the system in a very

1388
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,040
positive way which is yeah you know that

1389
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,599
that's great you know um

1390
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,520
we explore this on the on the paper that

1391
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,839
is should be out very very soon which is

1392
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,599
try to understand actually how can we

1393
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,319
generate in a change degenerative model

1394
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,800
with guided touch for example creating

1395
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,400
conditions where

1396
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,000
one could say okay let's focus on uh you

1397
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,760
know let's focus on the sensations let's

1398
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,359
focus okay you know this feels quite

1399
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,800
tight and actually what i'm doing here

1400
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,480
i'm releasing the fascia and so on okay

1401
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,240
so you can use that if you think the

1402
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,079
patient is actually

1403
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,760
is a suitable candidate for that you

1404
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,280
know you're not actually implanting

1405
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,640
another generative model there's

1406
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,559
something wrong with the structure okay

1407
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,800
that could help but for example if the

1408
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,359
patient gives too much attention to to

1409
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,400
that to those sort of

1410
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
sensations

1411
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,480
then you know it's probably wrong to get

1412
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,960
them to focus on those sensations

1413
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,280
so because actually just perpetuating a

1414
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,359
little bit of that you know belief that

1415
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,160
prior that actually okay it's tight yeah

1416
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,000
i'm worried about this and so on so for

1417
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,680
example we proposed these things coming

1418
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,440
from kind of a

1419
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,400
traditional sort of um

1420
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,799
meditation buddhist

1421
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,799
practices in in um

1422
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:47,839
you know

1423
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,400
that's for example you can short circuit

1424
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,319
the whole thing by for example start

1425
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,079
talking about something else

1426
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,839
which we talked about flattening the

1427
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,880
sensory states okay so imagine that you

1428
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,480
know you're palpating you're doing a

1429
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,160
technique and so on and suddenly and you

1430
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,760
feel like the patient is giving too much

1431
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,440
attention to that actually

1432
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,040
there's a sort of failure of sensory

1433
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,799
attenuation if you want to use in all

1434
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,400
the jargon here but

1435
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,799
if you if you then suddenly talk about

1436
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,440
oh yeah you know what i've got a new dog

1437
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
i was like where does the new dog come

1438
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,799
from okay

1439
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,359
or you know if you think that's uh you

1440
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,880
know they love football for example and

1441
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,920
their team won last night they say oh i

1442
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,000
watched the the match last night oh it

1443
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,440
was great wasn't it

1444
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,359
so that takes the attention away from

1445
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,040
that and actually kind of

1446
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,520
you know maybe enables you to start

1447
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
changing something that so it's a

1448
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,440
combination of clearly hands-on stuff

1449
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,640
where you

1450
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,319
cleverly can introduce the language

1451
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,559
to start

1452
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,240
start surprising the system start

1453
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,000
changing a little bit of that generative

1454
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,200
model so

1455
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,480
i think that's okay it's uh you know uh

1456
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,119
colleagues in the uk um

1457
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,440
have developed this osteomap approach

1458
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,119
those jobs in mindfulness and uh based

1459
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,839
approach also based on third wave

1460
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,920
cognitive behavioral therapy and

1461
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,839
actually uses the similar thing which is

1462
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,440
you know you're treating but you sort of

1463
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,599
talking you try to guide sometimes guide

1464
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,760
the patient say how does this feel

1465
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,240
what's what's going on here you know why

1466
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,079
why are you protecting and so on so you

1467
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,880
start exploring this so that could work

1468
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,359
really well arguably in a person that

1469
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,200
interceptively

1470
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,440
able to explore that

1471
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,760
if they're not

1472
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,839
interceptively prepared so for example

1473
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,680
switching you know giving too much

1474
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,359
attention to what's going on insights

1475
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,359
for some people makes them even more

1476
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,400
anxious

1477
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,000
so there's no point in saying yeah let's

1478
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,599
mentalize interception because you know

1479
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,960
that's going to be great for everything

1480
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,599
no it's not actually now i feel like a

1481
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,200
rumble in my tummy could be something

1482
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,119
going on really isn't it oh you know

1483
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,799
what what about if there's a pathology i

1484
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,200
just consulted with dr google he told me

1485
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,040
about this stuff so for some people

1486
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,359
that's clearly a no-go zone for other

1487
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,960
people yes you know we can explore that

1488
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,839
so again if you think through this lens

1489
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,799
uh i think that there's a lot of uh

1490
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,200
you know i think one can argue you can

1491
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,440
have a lot of fun in clinical practice

1492
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,680
by exploring things

1493
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,240
rather than limiting yourself to a very

1494
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,160
rigid sort of boxed

1495
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,280
approach

1496
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,880
and sometimes you you get a patient

1497
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,440
who's you know they get up from bad from

1498
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,200
from the you know from the plant and say

1499
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,400
oh actually

1500
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
feels a little bit better you know

1501
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,480
actually and it's it's painful but it's

1502
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,160
not as painful so

1503
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,000
arguably you started changing something

1504
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,960
already and that's where sometimes okay

1505
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,240
is it uh is it the sort of expectations

1506
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,599
is

1507
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,319
a placebo phenomena it is what it is you

1508
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,079
know you created all the conditions you

1509
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,440
put everything together it actually

1510
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,280
created a package of care

1511
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,359
that arguably can start changing things

1512
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,040
and for me and when a patient says it

1513
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,760
actually feels feels a bit easier

1514
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,440
it's kind of okay that's good stuff you

1515
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,599
know it's it's not the result of my

1516
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,680
technique is sort of whatever happened

1517
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,760
in this setting here

1518
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,520
there is you know they started the road

1519
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,680
you know their journey in the road to to

1520
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,160
recovery and that's pretty good

1521
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,240
and then you you've got you know if you

1522
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,000
ask the patient sometimes after a few

1523
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,920
sessions how do you feel today you know

1524
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,319
i feel better i feel much better how's

1525
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,440
your pain

1526
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,200
now on the visual analog scale the pen

1527
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,720
could be

1528
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,640
not different from last time or even

1529
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,480
this is the first session they may have

1530
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,839
started with a

1531
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,000
you know six or seven or eight or eight

1532
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,079
out of ten and at this stage are on a

1533
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
six out of ten for example

1534
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,480
so clinically there's not a meaningful

1535
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,880
change anyway but they may actually say

1536
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,200
i feel much better what does that mean

1537
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,119
you know feeling much better is yes you

1538
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,040
know it's the interceptive stuff it's

1539
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,799
about you know i

1540
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,760
i started kind of taking you know

1541
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,400
i started changing something so

1542
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,440
there is

1543
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,319
i think

1544
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,559
stuff to play with that combined clearly

1545
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,799
not just hands-on but the whole kind of

1546
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,880
uh you know creating a a package a

1547
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,440
multi-sensory um let's say experience as

1548
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,680
well

1549
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,880
awesome i i'd like to make sure zoe

1550
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,119
please

1551
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,559
um just to follow up on what uh george

1552
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,640
said um

1553
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,559
just from the the last bit and then i'll

1554
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,240
track back to

1555
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,599
um another point but i think

1556
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,079
it doesn't really matter sort of how you

1557
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,240
do it whether you try and shift their

1558
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,599
attention away from it by talking about

1559
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,480
something else whether you shift it away

1560
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,599
from

1561
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,040
using breathing or trying to approach

1562
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,760
the

1563
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,000
way in a different way you're basically

1564
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,319
trying to shift the attention away from

1565
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,160
what if they especially if they have

1566
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,480
chronic pain is an overly sort of

1567
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,359
precise maladaptive belief i mean

1568
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,000
it's just trying to get them to kind of

1569
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,960
step back a little bit from the prior

1570
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,680
that maybe or the feeling that they have

1571
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,839
predicted that they're going to feel so

1572
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,760
if they uh like george said bend

1573
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,000
forwards is painful if you get them to

1574
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,240
step back a little bit from that whether

1575
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,359
you do that

1576
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,119
um

1577
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,040
through

1578
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,559
talking or

1579
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,319
sort of focusing on your breath through

1580
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,680
mindfulness

1581
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,559
you

1582
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,000
want to shift it back to the the current

1583
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
what they're feeling rather than what

1584
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,720
they think that they're about to feel um

1585
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,559
so you can

1586
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,240
do that in many different ways but yeah

1587
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,720
definitely to try and focus away from it

1588
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,520
um i think it's you either kind of go

1589
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,599
down that path and shift the attention

1590
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,799
away to kind of then try to refocus or

1591
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,240
you kind of use touch is what we've um

1592
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,480
done in the paper to

1593
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,440
try and develop new associations or to

1594
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,880
reframe or to overwrite the the prior

1595
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,960
beliefs that maybe aren't quite working

1596
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,440
for that situation um

1597
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,880
to try and hope

1598
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,559
that by

1599
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,839
reducing and rewriting it by doing those

1600
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,839
exercises maybe to try and get them to

1601
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:08,640
do

1602
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,880
something that they they fear they think

1603
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,960
if they bend forwards because

1604
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,960
when they hurt their back that's they

1605
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,720
were bending forwards to pick something

1606
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,319
up from the floor and that was painful

1607
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,119
so now they're absolutely terrified that

1608
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,319
if they bend forwards that's going to

1609
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,839
happen or then dad

1610
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,960
sort of blew their disk if they

1611
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,960
when they were bending forwards to lift

1612
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,720
something that sort of prior belief

1613
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,960
we just want to try to make the

1614
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,599
opportunity often through touch or by

1615
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,520
doing an exercise and giving that sort

1616
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,920
of feedback that actually yeah you're

1617
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,520
you're bending forward but actually it's

1618
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,960
not that tight um and to try to inhibit

1619
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
that prior belief that they've they've

1620
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,240
got about expecting the pain and tried

1621
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,400
to reduce the weighting um

1622
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,799
that they've put on it so maybe think oh

1623
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,520
well and even if you can't

1624
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,839
change it so that they stop believing

1625
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,240
that every time they bend forwards it's

1626
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,240
going to be painful even if you can try

1627
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,720
and reframe it to context specific

1628
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,280
priors so say like well if you bend

1629
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,799
forwards in this way then it's okay you

1630
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,160
might not change the fact that they

1631
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,720
still think that bending forwards is um

1632
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,640
risky that

1633
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,640
you know they might not be they might be

1634
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,280
cognitively immune to to changing that

1635
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,359
completely but you might be able to

1636
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,280
through touch and through sort of

1637
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,799
encouraging them

1638
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,319
um to develop the prior for that context

1639
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,039
so

1640
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,520
if you

1641
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,680
you know bend forwards with this posture

1642
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,839
or this way or that that you can um

1643
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,359
you can update it and change it so they

1644
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,039
think okay well maybe actually in that

1645
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,640
situation it's okay

1646
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,680
um

1647
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,480
this brings us back to um

1648
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,200
they did a study with little kids about

1649
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,960
um with

1650
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,880
one that was slightly younger one that

1651
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,440
was um a bunch that was slightly older

1652
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,720
on balance and they gave the younger

1653
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,200
kids thought that balance um

1654
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,640
was just

1655
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,280
sort of gravity so um things balanced

1656
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,880
because they had gravity working upon it

1657
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,200
whereas the older kids thought that it

1658
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,119
wasn't that simple and that if the

1659
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,280
object was weighted more on one side

1660
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,039
then obviously even if it was gravity

1661
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,960
pulling it down they'd tilt

1662
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,559
and so there was two different theories

1663
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,559
of how balance works

1664
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,920
and they kind of the um

1665
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,640
the investigators gave the kids the

1666
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,760
other

1667
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,119
one so all the ones that thought it was

1668
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,119
just plain gravity were introduced to

1669
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,920
the concept um from the other ones and

1670
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,079
vice versa and they explained these

1671
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,920
concepts and then they showed them the

1672
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,160
block which they'd kind of used to say

1673
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,839
like look this is the block this is how

1674
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,920
it balances this is your theory

1675
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,039
and then

1676
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,440
they said well do you want to play and

1677
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,240
almost and every single one took the

1678
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,119
block

1679
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,799
tried out the other

1680
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,520
theory of how it balanced and then after

1681
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,839
sort of 10 minutes of play they asked

1682
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,839
them what they thought again and some of

1683
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,079
them changed their their minds and they

1684
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,440
used that sort of tactile sort of

1685
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,440
learning and touch to

1686
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,680
to update what they thought about their

1687
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,119
theory of balance

1688
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,520
and then to

1689
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,760
change and adapt slightly of what they

1690
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,240
thought some didn't change it completely

1691
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,119
some did but they all wanted to touch

1692
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,559
and explore

1693
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,599
to give them the opportunity to sort of

1694
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,640
understand that prior and to build up

1695
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,240
um

1696
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,079
a new belief of what maybe they thought

1697
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,559
was going on so i think we do that a lot

1698
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,119
in clinic

1699
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:45,530
um

1700
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:48,769
[Music]

1701
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,640
sorry just lost so look you can move

1702
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,599
further now or it doesn't feel so tight

1703
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,280
or that knot that you said you had

1704
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,319
doesn't feel as hard things like that um

1705
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,000
and back to

1706
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,359
the

1707
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,400
comment about how we relied on others i

1708
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,680
think it was um yes i'm working together

1709
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,160
um the hunter gatherer thing um

1710
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,720
they i think it's important to note that

1711
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,920
we're

1712
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,000
we're built to work together i mean we

1713
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,119
haven't got a choice um we might when

1714
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,160
we're sort of old enough to go hunt for

1715
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,599
deer and boar

1716
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,520
and things like that but when we're

1717
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,000
first born we we need the touch of our

1718
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,119
mother or a kegger of some sort to get

1719
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,520
to get our allostatic needs we cannot

1720
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,000
survive without them um if you leave a

1721
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,920
baby on its own

1722
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,720
that

1723
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,640
they probably won't survive on their own

1724
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,280
they need the mom or the person to to

1725
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,440
pick them up to feed them to regulate

1726
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,920
their body temperature

1727
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,160
to to do everything they they don't have

1728
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,079
a choice and even before that um

1729
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,000
neonatally

1730
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you're constantly as a fetus being

1731
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,520
bombarded with different information

1732
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,160
from your your mom and we touched upon

1733
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,720
this in the um

1734
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,119
the paper you need

1735
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,960
they they they constantly know what

1736
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,400
their mom is feeling and so of course

1737
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,079
once they're born they still want to

1738
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,160
coordinate with their mom because

1739
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,480
that's what they've been used to for

1740
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,960
nine months of as they start to develop

1741
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,280
and start to feel touch in different

1742
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,119
areas and you know they start to get

1743
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,960
nerves they want to explore and see what

1744
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,319
happens so

1745
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,280
yeah we're inherently need to rely on

1746
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,440
others at some point and while we get

1747
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,640
older it's not as continuous and we only

1748
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,640
rely on others maybe when

1749
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,319
we don't know what to do

1750
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,440
um

1751
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,079
then then we will it's not so like i'm

1752
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,280
not gonna

1753
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,319
relate to my caregiver now i know what

1754
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,920
my heart rate should be i know what's

1755
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,559
normal for me and that's different but

1756
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,400
when you're younger you don't have a

1757
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,599
choice and so

1758
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,839
and as you can't speak touch is is the

1759
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,640
first point of communication so

1760
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,400
yeah i think i'd touch on most of the

1761
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,680
points that were mentioned earlier

1762
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,440
awesome

1763
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,480
i wanted to bring a few active inference

1764
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,640
points in and and loop it in and then

1765
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,280
ask a great question in the chat so

1766
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,799
we've been talking a lot about the

1767
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,039
generative model and so the generative

1768
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,920
model is a statistical model that

1769
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,760
includes all these features we've been

1770
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,680
describing like perception cognitive

1771
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,559
variables and action selection

1772
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,119
and also it integrates this bayesian

1773
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,280
idea of the prior and the updates and

1774
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,559
the posterior so we talked earlier

1775
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,520
about how the practitioner is engaging

1776
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,839
in these informative perturbations and

1777
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,760
experiments of the patient's generative

1778
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,640
model

1779
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,760
and those perturbations can be seen as

1780
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,359
action selection

1781
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,760
that are informative by the generative

1782
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,160
model of the practitioner so in the

1783
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,480
therapeutic alliance in the niche of

1784
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,799
that clinic there's like multiple

1785
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,039
generative models that are engaging with

1786
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,200
each other and so that's a setting that

1787
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,839
active inference has been used to

1788
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:08,960
study

1789
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,119
and to connect that back to the bird

1790
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,760
song this is just it's it's such a

1791
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,198
fascinating um avenue of research

1792
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,439
that i think it's worth going one level

1793
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,839
into how the bird song plays out so

1794
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,000
we're we talked about the conversation

1795
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,399
and about how the patient has one type

1796
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,040
of experience and expertise

1797
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,960
in their own embodiment and then the

1798
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,600
clinician has another type of expertise

1799
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,759
in their education and also in their

1800
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,600
embodiment and where that comes together

1801
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,560
is through touch so in the bird song

1802
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,319
example there's this expected bird song

1803
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,359
we can think of it as like the

1804
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,520
stereotypical or the archetypal bird

1805
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
song that the birds are expecting to

1806
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,679
hear like if you're listening to a song

1807
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,158
that you know you're expecting it to be

1808
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,080
playing out a certain way

1809
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,198
now

1810
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,000
why

1811
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,479
doesn't one bird just sing

1812
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,080
and then the other one is hearing what

1813
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,158
it expects to hear

1814
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,880
so it never takes a turn and so in other

1815
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,359
words like why what the equivalent in

1816
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,279
the in the clinical setting would be

1817
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,399
like the expert clinician could just be

1818
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,719
speaking from their expertise and just

1819
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,679
giving a one-hour lecture on a condition

1820
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,198
or you could have a situation with a

1821
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,279
one-hour lecture the other direction

1822
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,279
with just the person sharing for one

1823
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,198
hour so how do we move from that like

1824
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,799
one directional

1825
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:29,759
um

1826
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,000
non-turn taking which still could be

1827
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,120
absolutely expertise on either side but

1828
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,759
there's this like emergent joint

1829
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,080
expertise when there's a conversation so

1830
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,560
how does active inference model that

1831
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,000
turn taking

1832
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,040
and

1833
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,640
perhaps not the only way that this could

1834
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,479
be modeled but how it is modeled in the

1835
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,520
bird song papers of fristen and frith

1836
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,920
is that action selection

1837
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,480
requires a transient suppression

1838
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,679
of precision on action selection

1839
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,440
so in other words if i'm seated right

1840
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,360
now and i want to engage in standing up

1841
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,520
there has to be a transient suppression

1842
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,480
of precision like an openness around

1843
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,120
what am i doing because if my confident

1844
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,120
belief is i am sitting down

1845
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,080
then engaging the counterfactual i could

1846
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,280
stand up will never be enacted because i

1847
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,719
have a high precision belief that it's

1848
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,120
simply not the case and in fact they've

1849
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,040
connected that to various

1850
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,480
movement disorders where there's

1851
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,719
challenges in initiating or challenges

1852
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,960
and terminating behavior and so what's

1853
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,600
happening with the turn-taking birds

1854
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,760
is that one bird is singing and so it's

1855
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,159
singing from the song book so to speak

1856
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:41,760
the expected song

1857
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,480
but it's continued engagement in singing

1858
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,880
is accompanied by this increasing

1859
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,280
reduction in precision

1860
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,920
around what it is doing it's kind of

1861
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,360
like someone going on a rant and there's

1862
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,360
like they're actually losing precision

1863
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,600
they're losing the thread as the rant

1864
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,120
continues

1865
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,360
as a function of them suppressing

1866
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,120
accuracy because they have to engage in

1867
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,159
action

1868
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,800
and then at some point that elicits

1869
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,719
that acting entity

1870
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,320
to seize action

1871
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,719
and to increase its its precision

1872
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,239
through listening through active

1873
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,400
listening and so that is how the birds

1874
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,880
take turns in this bird song even though

1875
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,800
they're singing from the same sheet they

1876
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,280
do take turns because they're engaged in

1877
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,280
like a transient suppression of

1878
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,440
precision on action that allows them to

1879
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,159
act then that imprecision around action

1880
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,159
becomes too much and then they need to

1881
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,360
recover

1882
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,400
that precision through listening again

1883
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,760
so it's quite an interesting thing and

1884
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,400
it just reminded me of like well there's

1885
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,640
a dialogue it doesn't have to be equal

1886
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,400
time it doesn't even have to be speaking

1887
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,480
all the time but there has to be this

1888
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,400
emergent dialogue

1889
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,600
otherwise

1890
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,760
it would just be a one-way phone call

1891
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,159
with the download on the clinical side

1892
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,520
or the download on the person's

1893
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,920
experience so i hope that that these

1894
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,239
kinds of formal models like the bird

1895
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,600
songs the toy model but seeing that kind

1896
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,560
of a generative model play out

1897
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,199
in the context of the skilled

1898
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,000
uh performance and experimentation

1899
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,360
this might sound weird but you know why

1900
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,199
don't you try doing this and then the

1901
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,239
patient brings up something

1902
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,600
unconventional or they discover

1903
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,920
something new about their body and that

1904
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,480
is where like healing and and openness

1905
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,719
can occur so that was like awesome

1906
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,840
threads

1907
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,000
and then i want to ask the question in

1908
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,840
the chat for for everybody it would be

1909
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,719
great to hear their responses so

1910
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,320
glia maximalist in the chat has asked

1911
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,719
how can patients learn to think about

1912
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,600
pain

1913
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,360
in order to update their generative

1914
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,400
model

1915
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,800
or is this something that is possible to

1916
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,280
do subconsciously with the assistance of

1917
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,640
the treatment

1918
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,480
so what are the explicit

1919
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,080
cognitive and implicit cognitive

1920
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,360
aspects

1921
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,320
of updating generative models around

1922
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,559
pain

1923
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,480
yeah okay um yeah george then denzel now

1924
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,080
okay

1925
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,920
um

1926
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,880
i think it starts with education about

1927
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,520
pain you know what's

1928
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,679
what is pain and why people

1929
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,960
have that experience and clearly having

1930
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,719
you know two

1931
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,080
sort of situations where uh in in acute

1932
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,120
pain

1933
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,080
pain being kind of regarded typically as

1934
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,199
as as a useful protective mechanism if

1935
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,040
you just hurt yourself you

1936
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,640
you know if you twist your ankle and

1937
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,440
you're in pain uh and there's a minor

1938
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,040
tissue

1939
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,760
problem and that needs time to to heal

1940
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,760
and so on so clearly there is pain and

1941
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,440
people need to understand that you know

1942
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,199
you're in pain because this happened and

1943
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,120
this protection and should go away and

1944
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,000
so on the the challenges is is much more

1945
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,640
complex when we face chronic pain

1946
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,800
because you know in those cases and a

1947
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,120
lot of times the protection

1948
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,199
and no longer needs to be there why is

1949
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,520
is protecting from from what and it's

1950
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,600
not necessarily a need to

1951
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,679
to protect but the system becomes pretty

1952
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,679
good that's you know it's almost like

1953
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,520
generating that stuff and people

1954
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,320
continue having sometimes a presentation

1955
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,800
that is in a limping or or a particular

1956
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,520
muscle spasm clean movement and so on i

1957
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,239
think it's it's about sort of

1958
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,000
starting with with understand getting

1959
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,840
the person to understand the nature of

1960
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,560
what's what pain is about without giving

1961
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,320
them a lecture on the neuroscience of

1962
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,840
pain because you know that that's

1963
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,679
clearly does not work as well so it

1964
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,280
needs to be something that is simple

1965
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,440
straightforward so it starts with that

1966
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,040
there needs to be a

1967
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,239
you know

1968
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,679
a reasonably well explained um

1969
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,280
kind of framework

1970
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,040
um

1971
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,040
you uh i think you know what are you

1972
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,560
talking about the bird song and so on

1973
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,880
it's kind of you know

1974
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,480
interesting thing about you know sensory

1975
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,320
attenuation which

1976
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,120
in in in the context of of chronic pain

1977
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,120
and we argue that on the other paper on

1978
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,199
active

1979
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:09,040
osteoporosis in active inference

1980
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,199
that probably in some cases of chronic

1981
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,000
pain is is actually a failure of this

1982
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,280
attention so disengaging from that

1983
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,960
um

1984
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,920
constant attention to to the problem how

1985
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,600
do you achieve that

1986
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,640
yes

1987
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,920
again

1988
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,400
communication touching talking or not

1989
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,960
talking and taking turns and and and the

1990
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,199
analogy to the bird song is is is

1991
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,199
clearly you know it's a fascinating

1992
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,960
thing it's clearly

1993
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,199
what we try to to reach you know that

1994
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,440
that synchrony between two or more

1995
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,280
individuals in that clinical setting

1996
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,719
when things start

1997
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,280
kind of working well and uh you know

1998
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,080
it's leading to somewhere so just some

1999
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,840
thought so in

2000
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,360
thank you

2001
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,800
yes i

2002
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,920
you know

2003
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,159
agree with agree with that

2004
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,480
that needs to be kind of simple and

2005
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,280
understandable explanation but uh

2006
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,800
challenging the

2007
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,760
the perhaps previous views um i'm just

2008
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,120
sort of reminded of um

2009
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,960
specifically for the person who asked

2010
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,199
this question

2011
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:25,440
the work of yoni ashar and torvagner's

2012
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,520
pain reprocessing

2013
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,880
therapy

2014
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,960
study is a bolder study

2015
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,040
but it's been

2016
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,480
converted into a book called the way out

2017
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,800
um on chronic pain

2018
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,760
and an app called curable so um for

2019
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,360
people who are watching this live stream

2020
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,280
there are some simple things to to check

2021
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,520
out and the way out is published by

2022
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,280
penguin and the the elements of how they

2023
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,040
suggest to

2024
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,960
um

2025
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,960
self you know self

2026
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,159
care for chronic pain are two things so

2027
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,080
one is they call it somatic tracking

2028
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,520
which is basically an interceptive

2029
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,719
exercise where you with curiosity

2030
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,400
and lightness and openness sort of um

2031
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,320
explore the pain

2032
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,080
and um secondly is to build evidence of

2033
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,719
safety so to actually literally write

2034
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,440
lists of you know right now i'm

2035
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,800
experiencing

2036
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,960
um

2037
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,280
evidence that my body i'm safe in my

2038
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,280
body for whatever reason it might be

2039
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,280
because you know just i'm here sitting

2040
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,199
and breathing that means i'm relatively

2041
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,080
safe

2042
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,600
um so those two things exploring

2043
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,400
the

2044
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,800
the pain in a different way and building

2045
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,280
evidence of safety um so that's you know

2046
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,600
i i think that's a quite nice starting

2047
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,840
point

2048
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,320
thank you zoe anything you would add

2049
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,480
there

2050
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,199
yeah sorry

2051
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,480
i i was dying

2052
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,520
um

2053
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,000
yeah i think definitely as george said

2054
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
trying to keep it simple is

2055
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,600
essential if i start talking to my

2056
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,880
patient about like the acc and how it

2057
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,560
changes this part of the brain and it

2058
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,400
works on this bit i think i'd lose them

2059
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,679
within five seconds

2060
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,520
um they're not

2061
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,520
most patients while they're not so

2062
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,280
interested in all the neuroscience

2063
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,600
behind it um if you tried to to speak to

2064
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,560
them i think it depends on the patient

2065
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,800
how best to sort of

2066
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,320
um

2067
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,480
make

2068
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,719
their pain kind of realized i think most

2069
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,960
patients find it difficult to say what

2070
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,040
their pain is sometimes

2071
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,040
they can't describe what they're feeling

2072
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,600
they they don't know the words to kind

2073
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,440
of say which is why sort of i think

2074
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,080
touch is also useful in this aspect

2075
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,719
because you might be able to

2076
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,159
try and show

2077
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,000
someone something without actually

2078
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,560
having to to say it

2079
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,719
um and definitely as george said in

2080
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,600
chronic pain it's again not so simple

2081
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,679
people can be cognitively immune no

2082
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,320
matter how much you try to explain it um

2083
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,840
they might just

2084
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,280
not want to

2085
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,960
sort of update or to to hear it so

2086
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,239
um

2087
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,159
yeah i think it depends on their priors

2088
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:17,520
their situation and how best you think

2089
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,239
that you can kind of get that across

2090
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,199
whatever way um you think might be more

2091
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,679
amenable to them

2092
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,239
i'll pass it back to ian this yeah yeah

2093
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,600
thanks um

2094
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,760
just picking up on what george and zoey

2095
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,320
have said about you know different sub

2096
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,000
sub categories of patients who might be

2097
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,040
more or less open to different tools

2098
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,000
that

2099
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,560
can be offered to them so as you said

2100
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,159
you know someone who's suffering from a

2101
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,640
certain type of anxiety might be

2102
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,159
immune to

2103
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,000
bringing more attention to their

2104
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,920
intraceptive sensorium whereas um

2105
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,800
you know

2106
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,239
that might be accessible to someone

2107
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,600
who's cognitively immune to the can you

2108
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,040
know the conceptual idea they might

2109
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,000
actually

2110
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,199
enjoy the

2111
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,679
so i'm thinking for future research how

2112
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,800
can we

2113
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
find markers or indicators for these

2114
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,880
different subcategories of people that

2115
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,719
can be picked up really early so you

2116
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,400
know a therapist can say work their way

2117
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,199
through a flow diagram when i'm doing my

2118
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,960
taking my history case history for this

2119
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,840
patient they you know as i'm talking to

2120
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,880
them

2121
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
they seem you know they their own

2122
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,360
they're showing signs of being open to

2123
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,880
this thing but not that thing and then

2124
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,520
you can work your way through and end up

2125
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,719
with okay i'm going to use this i'm

2126
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,239
going to try this tool first as the

2127
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,840
first test and then if that doesn't work

2128
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,639
then i try try that so you know getting

2129
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,840
some

2130
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,280
big studies with big n numbers that um

2131
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,840
that try to identify these different

2132
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,000
subcategories of

2133
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,480
clinical indicators

2134
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,199
that's awesome thanks zoe

2135
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,280
um yeah so

2136
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,520
i haven't read massively big studies but

2137
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,840
one thing to consider that you can get

2138
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,120
from the case history is the family um

2139
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,360
especially if you're treating kids the

2140
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,440
research that's come out um more

2141
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,480
recently

2142
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,120
on the parents priors

2143
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,239
um they took a study looking at kids in

2144
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,600
a rheumatological clinic

2145
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,400
93

2146
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,880
of their parents had pain

2147
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,159
um had chronic had had some sort of pain

2148
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:31,520
um they showed that if the parents

2149
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,679
reported pain when they were doing

2150
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,239
exercise the kids were more likely to

2151
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:40,400
have higher pain levels to um report

2152
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,840
more problems not just in and general

2153
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
health issues not just with that but

2154
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,719
also

2155
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:47,920
things like they didn't want to do their

2156
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,880
homework um so even more general things

2157
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,800
were affected by sort of the way that

2158
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,239
their parents thought they were more

2159
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,280
likely to catastrophize that was one

2160
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,199
um massive thing that if their parents

2161
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,159
had experienced more pain then the kids

2162
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,480
risk of catastrophization was

2163
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,480
significantly more and almost that you

2164
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,760
could predict

2165
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,840
the amount that they would from that

2166
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,080
same with studies

2167
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,360
with oxytocin the parents oxytocin from

2168
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,239
10 minutes play with their kid then men

2169
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,400
that you could empirically predict how

2170
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,960
much oxytocin the kid would increase

2171
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,480
um so i think

2172
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,480
some things like that you

2173
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,600
can

2174
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,239
pick up from the case history if you

2175
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,040
know people or they're willing

2176
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,639
to let you know

2177
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,520
about

2178
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,159
what might be going on previously some

2179
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,320
patients won't want to talk about it but

2180
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,120
some

2181
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,840
you might be able to get from if there's

2182
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,400
more than one of them in it or something

2183
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,960
like that that's one indicator now of

2184
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,400
what you know

2185
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,520
if you they come in and someone else or

2186
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,600
they've said something about

2187
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,000
um a belief that someone else has had it

2188
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,239
might be harder to kind of

2189
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,679
change

2190
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,960
it like why are you more um

2191
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,040
of an expert than their

2192
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,520
parent or whoever had said it so i think

2193
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,320
that's

2194
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,880
there's one way that they're starting to

2195
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,960
kind of pick up that you could easily

2196
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,719
implement into your case history you

2197
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,719
might already be asking about that you

2198
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:21,520
just didn't realize the significance

2199
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,120
of it you knew it was significant but

2200
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,120
not the extent that we're now sort of

2201
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,000
starting to realize

2202
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,280
yes

2203
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,760
very interesting of course we're just

2204
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,280
exploring like different

2205
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,880
avenues but in

2206
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,760
and it's not my area as only an ant

2207
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,800
doctor

2208
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,920
but

2209
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,000
whether somebody uses

2210
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,520
thinking or feeling type words

2211
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,920
or refers to their own direct experience

2212
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,840
versus the experience of somebody who

2213
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,760
they trust versus information they

2214
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,400
received from a search engine

2215
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,560
those are all cues

2216
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,120
maybe that is what then

2217
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,679
the clinical decision making pivots

2218
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,639
towards

2219
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,679
or maybe it's acute that other

2220
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,239
areas in that cognitive space would be

2221
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,719
informative to explore like if somebody

2222
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,639
spends 10 sentences talking about what

2223
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,120
they received from their body

2224
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,639
you could ask if you've asked anyone

2225
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,480
else or what did you look at when you

2226
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,400
researched it if somebody says 10 things

2227
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,120
about just what they researched maybe

2228
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,199
how does that reflect with your own

2229
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,120
experience like just to kind of even the

2230
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,800
score and and sample across different

2231
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,520
regions of this space

2232
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,600
then that could potentially you know

2233
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,560
help

2234
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,120
give a coherent and holistic

2235
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,719
perspective which

2236
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,159
is kind of implicit in a lot of the

2237
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,080
discussions that that all of you are

2238
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,440
bringing here so ian

2239
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,320
yeah all really good

2240
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,280
um

2241
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,520
suggestions there and

2242
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,600
zoe as you were talking i was thinking

2243
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,199
about um

2244
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,800
i've heard sort of similar studies with

2245
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,639
uh parents with digestive problems and

2246
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,920
you know children with digestive

2247
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,600
problems but then it got me thinking

2248
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,320
about intergenerational trauma and dna

2249
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,280
methylation and you know epigenetics

2250
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,719
um

2251
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,280
and whether they're you know this is not

2252
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,760
necessarily within our scope immediately

2253
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,800
but longer term are there any

2254
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,360
dna screen methylation screen patterns

2255
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,440
that can be used to see if someone might

2256
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,800
be more or less um

2257
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,719
open to

2258
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:33,920
different

2259
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,719
interventions

2260
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,639
interesting

2261
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,960
note there like and these these

2262
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,560
cognitive approaches it's a it's a

2263
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,800
complement to understanding the

2264
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,360
correlation between the rheumatological

2265
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,040
outcomes of the parents and the children

2266
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,719
like one

2267
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,840
possible aspect is there's a

2268
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,560
predisposition

2269
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,840
carried through

2270
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,920
the dna sequence carried through an

2271
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,800
epigenomic modification carried through

2272
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,080
a shared and cultured niche a shared way

2273
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,000
of expecting things like

2274
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,760
those may come

2275
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,280
differently into play

2276
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,360
in the n equals one

2277
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,520
that is the therapeutic alliance that's

2278
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,760
assembling around this person who is

2279
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,320
having this experience and so that is

2280
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,280
kind of like what breaks through

2281
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,199
the the large n

2282
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,760
and just presents us very plainly and

2283
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,600
starkly with this one person's

2284
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,600
experience and there isn't going to be a

2285
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,840
large study with that person because

2286
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,480
nobody will ever replicate

2287
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,600
one or two or five of those aspects so

2288
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,239
that's like where the the um

2289
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,400
the large and the small end and sort of

2290
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,719
a top-down and a bottom-up approach to

2291
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,560
these topics

2292
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,199
hits the the compromise um george

2293
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,080
um

2294
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,320
yeah that would be fascinating to try to

2295
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,320
see if people are more

2296
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,280
predisposed to respond to some forms of

2297
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,760
therapy and or not now

2298
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,760
interesting thing you know we we've done

2299
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,239
uh several studies in you know in

2300
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,239
neonathology uh

2301
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,880
with preterm babies and we found that

2302
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,600
osteopathic care seemed to produce well

2303
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,440
was effective in reducing length or stay

2304
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,280
in hospital we tested also the

2305
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,120
hypothesis comparing

2306
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,080
in a static touch with a form of dynamic

2307
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,920
effective touch we saw that um

2308
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,560
you know there is a there is a role in

2309
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,159
modulating the you know reducing arousal

2310
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,000
from from an autonomic perspective it

2311
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,880
seems to you know babies respond to to

2312
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,840
death

2313
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,159
and one could argue that actually

2314
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,639
they are you know that the priors there

2315
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:43,520
aren't

2316
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,199
great yet because you know they're

2317
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,719
responding to

2318
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,520
to that to that contact we also know

2319
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,280
that kangaroo care is an effective

2320
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,080
evidence-based approach in pre-term

2321
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,719
for preterm so skin to sink skin contact

2322
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,520
with with with parents so this stuff

2323
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,760
seems you know again plays you know

2324
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,120
suggests that

2325
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,600
touch seems to play an important role it

2326
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,320
would be good and we tried to do that to

2327
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,280
look at

2328
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,040
for example the babies that received

2329
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,239
that hands-on intervention uh to follow

2330
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,679
them for a number of years and do

2331
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,840
prospective study and actually see

2332
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,360
what happened uh

2333
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,520
you know in terms of cognitive and you

2334
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,639
know uh you know and and general sort of

2335
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,840
development

2336
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,000
this but then you know if we if we start

2337
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,840
thinking about okay yeah it's okay the

2338
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,400
babies are sort of

2339
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,360
not uh don't know really how to respond

2340
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,800
then there are some some interesting

2341
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,280
ideas being developed in particular with

2342
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,960
people like anna chanukah looking at uh

2343
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,400
inutro being the first prior in fact

2344
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,600
okay so

2345
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,560
so

2346
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,639
and if you look at in some cultures

2347
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,360
mothers touch their belly and sort of

2348
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,600
interact start interacting with with

2349
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,000
with the baby very early on

2350
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,800
uh so actually arguably those

2351
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,719
babies already starting being touched

2352
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,960
and they're sort of primed to

2353
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,800
probably responding a bit in a more

2354
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,400
positive way to

2355
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,000
tactile kind of stimulation

2356
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,639
and that is also uh research start

2357
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,880
talking about for example in the case of

2358
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,400
of of twins

2359
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,040
they start touching chad around so to

2360
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,400
week 12 a week 20 or so so again there's

2361
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,920
a form of you know

2362
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,840
tactile contact

2363
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,280
stimulation

2364
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,159
uh other you know other authors for

2365
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,400
example katrina fortune talks about and

2366
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,560
actually the first prior is actually the

2367
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,120
mother for example so again goes to the

2368
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,199
idea that actually either through um

2369
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,880
you know prior to

2370
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,120
one being born the the sort of that

2371
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,960
interaction with the mother creates that

2372
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,800
price so likely

2373
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,199
you know it creates a predisposition

2374
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,520
perhaps to to

2375
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,000
to the sort of a good response to a more

2376
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,840
manual type of of intervention so

2377
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,440
you know the fascinating things can be

2378
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,040
explored of course you know always have

2379
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,120
you know from a negative perspective

2380
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,480
sometimes in randomized controlled

2381
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,840
trials people say yeah but you know

2382
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,360
those guys kind of you know was good

2383
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,639
outcome because those were good

2384
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,280
responders to treatment anyway

2385
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,960
but again what does being a good

2386
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,639
responder to a manual type of

2387
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,639
intervention actually means you know the

2388
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,880
variables are such you know so many that

2389
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,920
it actually

2390
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,719
um you know kind of

2391
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,800
the scope is huge so

2392
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,440
one one could explore but actually there

2393
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,760
are some serious questions in you know

2394
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,719
in the whole thing for sure

2395
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:39,679
thank you

2396
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,360
zoe and then we'll have kind of a

2397
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,280
closing thoughts as we finish the dot

2398
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,120
one

2399
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,800
yeah i think just to go off what george

2400
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,960
said they've shown in

2401
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,600
um neonates as well um

2402
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,719
that as

2403
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,280
basically as soon as an area of the body

2404
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,199
starts to get um

2405
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,560
any sort of nerve innovation at all the

2406
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,560
fetus will start to touch that area so

2407
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,480
when they start to get the face which is

2408
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,000
often one of the first that's why you

2409
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,320
see a lot on ultrasound's baby touching

2410
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,199
their faces or their hands or things as

2411
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,880
soon as they get innovation to that area

2412
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,719
they're touching it to explore to see

2413
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,840
what that

2414
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,040
what is this

2415
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,360
um that they can now feel so i think

2416
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,840
definitely touch is um one of the first

2417
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,520
things that

2418
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,760
people will use to develop a prior or to

2419
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,560
just understand what is going on in sort

2420
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,360
of the world that is is around them um

2421
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,440
to expand upon what george said the

2422
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,239
long term they did do one study

2423
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:44,880
about the long-term effects of a

2424
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,400
kangaroo care

2425
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,760
incubator and full-term

2426
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,199
um babies and they found that

2427
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,760
um while the this was more towards the

2428
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,560
the synchrony with the the parent but

2429
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,080
when they

2430
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,280
were

2431
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,000
initially it was the

2432
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,239
the full-time ones that didn't need any

2433
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,880
help had the sort of strongest synchrony

2434
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,560
the strongest sort of

2435
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,120
um physiological

2436
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,719
yeah

2437
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,360
sorry i saw miss midnight here and um

2438
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,880
then the

2439
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,239
um skin skin contact um

2440
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:23,840
was sort of next and then the incubator

2441
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,199
was after and this was initially um one

2442
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:29,760
they were they're doing it but when they

2443
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,320
followed up on these same kids when they

2444
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,840
were adults they found that actually the

2445
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,440
the synchrony between them when they

2446
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,080
were adults to their parents um was the

2447
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,639
same so the ones that got the skin to

2448
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,239
skin contact had the same as the

2449
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:47,199
full-time ones um so it had developed

2450
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,239
over their whole life that continuous

2451
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:53,440
effect of touch builds up um so that

2452
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,679
they were on par whereas before they

2453
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,679
were lower down so it's not something

2454
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,440
that's just developed

2455
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,560
um

2456
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,960
in those sort of critical

2457
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,600
period where things are developing more

2458
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,360
it is something that you know the

2459
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,280
effects that had happened when you were

2460
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,960
one two three um to building up when you

2461
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,960
were 12 to 18 still have an effect when

2462
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,320
you're not i mean there's areas of the

2463
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,480
brain that don't start developing fully

2464
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,080
until you're 26

2465
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,080
so you know that's a lot of experiences

2466
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,440
that you're going to have from different

2467
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,000
parts until that age they're all going

2468
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
to contribute to it so it's not sort of

2469
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,040
just

2470
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,199
the first prize then they've shown that

2471
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,920
those prizes especially with touch are

2472
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,560
still evident

2473
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,719
in adults

2474
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,520
just because they had its baby

2475
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,560
it's another value for integrative

2476
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,120
models we can have continuity between

2477
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,199
the nutrients delivery

2478
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,400
in utero and then the neonate with the

2479
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,239
spoon coming in airplane making the

2480
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:59,120
landing and then adults who have a

2481
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,800
little bit more agency maybe in their

2482
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,960
peri-personal space with the spoon and

2483
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,639
landing the airplane but there's the

2484
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,360
supply chain so it's just another part

2485
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,800
of an extended

2486
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,440
nutrient cycling system

2487
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,199
and

2488
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,360
are we going to have custom

2489
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,080
narrow theories for each one of these

2490
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,600
settings

2491
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,960
and or

2492
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,760
will we have some layers and

2493
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,040
interoperability between these different

2494
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,440
settings that help us like transpose

2495
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,960
useful models and find areas of contact

2496
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,480
those are all really important

2497
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,280
um areas for lifelong learning like you

2498
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,120
brought up and there's areas of the

2499
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,320
brain that

2500
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,800
continue after you're 26 people still

2501
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,880
learn things and so that's brain

2502
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
development too um

2503
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,760
i just wanted to look at figure one and

2504
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,480
or figure two and just in kind of our

2505
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,080
closing thoughts

2506
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,159
what is uh one of well figure one and

2507
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,760
figure two both have like a really

2508
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,119
creative and um delightful

2509
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:02,080
style so figure one is focusing on

2510
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,960
different

2511
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,960
functions that are discussed in the

2512
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,520
paper and in relationship to empirical

2513
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,639
evidence around different brain regions

2514
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,199
and figure two is kind of pulling out

2515
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,960
one level

2516
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,639
looking at different functions that are

2517
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,320
arising in here the dyad so maybe if

2518
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,560
each person whether figure one or figure

2519
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,520
two what's like one area that you're

2520
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,960
excited to

2521
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,920
talk about in dot 2 or one thing that

2522
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,239
you think um like really stood out to

2523
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,000
you as something that was a contribution

2524
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,679
that you weren't seeing

2525
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,040
in other

2526
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,440
work or in other ways of representing

2527
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,600
these topics

2528
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,719
so maybe ian first um and then we'll

2529
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,400
hear from the authors but anything from

2530
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,080
figure one or figure two that would be

2531
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,440
exciting to explore more

2532
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,199
thanks daniel what stands out for me

2533
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,679
today is the two monkeys doing a

2534
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,560
one-handed handstand with a joyful look

2535
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,199
on their face so this idea of

2536
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,840
cooperative communication and that to me

2537
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,920
today that speaks to this idea of you

2538
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,040
know

2539
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,480
they neither of them look like they're

2540
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,920
an expert they look like they're playing

2541
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,119
together um which is a nice

2542
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,679
approach uh to think of in the

2543
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:17,920
therapeutic alliance um not always

2544
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,280
possible to be playful but you know when

2545
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,800
possible

2546
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,520
can we be like the monkeys um but then

2547
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,639
and moving on

2548
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,560
i'd like to explore maybe this idea of

2549
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,679
um

2550
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,199
arriving at the realization that we're

2551
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,199
similar or identical so again those

2552
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,000
monkeys look pretty identical but

2553
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
what does that mean i'd like to hear

2554
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,159
from the authors about about that

2555
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:41,679
and then

2556
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,159
maybe next time or exploring this idea

2557
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,520
of

2558
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,440
when the generative models or the

2559
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,800
allostatic

2560
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,080
regulation the set points start to drift

2561
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,600
and that you know i'm thinking more

2562
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,480
broadly in our society our health

2563
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,159
global health problems

2564
01:36:58,159 --> 01:36:59,280
are

2565
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,080
are they drifting of our allostatic set

2566
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,480
points around food production and what

2567
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,719
healthy food actually means and how it's

2568
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:07,920
how that's

2569
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,679
aeroplane coming into the mouth you know

2570
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,280
the some

2571
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,080
expert model has um told us that certain

2572
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,679
foods should be

2573
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,520
what we eat but the you know the health

2574
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,400
indicators um

2575
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,560
suggest that it's not that model may not

2576
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,440
be the best model and how do we as

2577
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,199
therapists are open to this active

2578
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,119
inference model kind of keep that

2579
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,679
possibility of drifting this model

2580
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:36,000
drifting and how do we how do we decide

2581
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,360
what the set point should be

2582
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,760
yeah from the from the airplane landing

2583
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,760
the spoon to literally

2584
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,440
the airplane landing with the food

2585
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,159
we never grow up

2586
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,840
okay figure one or figure two george

2587
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,040
um

2588
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:02,678
i have no

2589
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,600
i don't think i have a much more to add

2590
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,719
um

2591
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,199
you know the the figure figure one of

2592
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,679
course you know

2593
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,760
it's a sort of an overview really where

2594
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,159
uh potentially so there's a sort of

2595
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,239
potato um

2596
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,000
effects of touch at all different

2597
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,760
different levels

2598
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,000
um

2599
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:25,280
yeah you know

2600
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,960
one thing i'm quite keen actually that

2601
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,719
thing about the two monkeys playing and

2602
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,440
kind of communicating and so on is that

2603
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,119
although we we

2604
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:34,719
you know we have a strong bias in the

2605
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,040
paper towards a certain neuroscience

2606
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,119
kind of based model

2607
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,360
that uh it is critical that we don't

2608
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,199
turn the whole thing into a neurocentric

2609
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,119
model okay because

2610
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,280
ultimately if he complained too much

2611
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,360
about biomedical model

2612
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,800
and then kind of

2613
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,119
pain management became

2614
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:56,000
brain-centric neurocentric model kind of

2615
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,800
you know

2616
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,480
nothing really changes does it you know

2617
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,000
it's a sort of still

2618
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,040
you know uh

2619
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,199
depending on an expert that details

2620
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:06,560
tells you exactly what to do so um yeah

2621
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,199
that's i i like you know the figure two

2622
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:12,719
kind of gives us more a little bit of uh

2623
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,360
an ability to look at the the whole kind

2624
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,800
of process

2625
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,679
uh where uh within that process and

2626
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:20,480
again

2627
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,840
i'm i'm quite aware of you know

2628
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,520
criticisms that

2629
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,760
you know this paper may also attract

2630
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,199
from yeah you know these guys just

2631
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,760
basically quantificating around touch is

2632
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,760
the most important thing and so on and i

2633
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,920
clearly i'm not on that at that level

2634
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,320
i'm i'm clearly arguing for no no it's

2635
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,360
not that is is an important tool

2636
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,840
it's an important vehicle but ultimately

2637
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,679
it's about communication in my opinion

2638
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,639
it's about me you know what's what i uh

2639
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,960
what i'm trying to kind of get into that

2640
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,480
niche that bird song yeah uh getting

2641
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,719
that biobehavioral synchrony going and i

2642
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,639
think you know when you're getting there

2643
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,880
then things you know can you know some

2644
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,119
very interesting things can happen

2645
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,600
and uh and and you know i

2646
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,520
you know we can explore this that's uh

2647
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,679
2.0 next time and

2648
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,119
even

2649
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,360
some ideas about some of the techniques

2650
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,280
that potentially people kind of make big

2651
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,199
arguments and people are super critical

2652
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,880
about you know for example more cranial

2653
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,679
sacral or cranial-based type of stuff

2654
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,280
that it doesn't work that way but you

2655
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,360
know one could argue that maybe the

2656
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,760
phenomena that we observe is actually a

2657
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,239
phenomenon of synchrony is that is the

2658
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,360
bird song

2659
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,360
and that enables us to get some very

2660
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,679
interesting things going so

2661
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,760
i just i'm i'm thinking a lot i'm

2662
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,000
allowed i'm kind of uh

2663
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,159
exploring through but uh

2664
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:44,000
i think for me that's so figure two

2665
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,920
clearly the other one is sort of you

2666
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,719
know

2667
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,080
we don't treat the brain who treat the

2668
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,119
person

2669
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,360
there's a person living that or in that

2670
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,320
body

2671
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,639
uh rather than treating bodies you know

2672
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:55,600
we're not

2673
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,080
you know don't think we should sort of

2674
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,320
be at that level you know it's body work

2675
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,159
you know it's not body work is you know

2676
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,239
it's it's a different story you know

2677
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,400
it's really it's about the person

2678
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,719
more than the body the body tells us a

2679
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:10,800
story but it can be a mark of blanket

2680
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,719
body can be many things but

2681
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,679
body it provides a landscape

2682
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,080
sensory landscape an opportunity to get

2683
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,719
in to kind of influence and so on but

2684
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,400
okay that's it you know what about the

2685
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,040
person lives there and what's uh that's

2686
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,800
that's for me the fascinating bit you

2687
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,280
know and sometimes the thing you change

2688
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,360
minor things in their generative model

2689
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,719
when the whole thing starts getting

2690
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,239
better anything you know

2691
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,400
you surprise yourself so

2692
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,239
that's placebo yeah whatever it is but

2693
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,239
you know that's i think that's that's

2694
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:43,919
could potentially be the beauty of it

2695
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,080
yes from kind of a body work

2696
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,440
the cadaver materialism physicalism to

2697
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,199
embodied work

2698
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,600
with the richness of the situation that

2699
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,840
that's the map and the territory and

2700
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,560
very interesting and the last word for

2701
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,360
the first author

2702
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,480
yeah so i think um both the figures um

2703
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,480
i think figure one

2704
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,360
when

2705
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,840
i was sort of

2706
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,600
sketching out what i sort of wanted to

2707
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,159
do for i did again sort of go with um

2708
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,880
from what george said it's not yes it's

2709
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,600
neurocentric in terms of it's labeled

2710
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,159
based on the areas of the brain but if

2711
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:35,600
you think more sort of broadly about it

2712
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,800
the

2713
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,199
i mean it covers a wide range of things

2714
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,320
you have the the two monkeys having fun

2715
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,639
to the mom um

2716
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:47,199
holding her baby to

2717
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:48,159
sort of

2718
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,280
then

2719
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,520
you know people being really happy that

2720
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,320
they've won something to them the heart

2721
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,800
i mean it just i think what i like about

2722
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,440
it is while it shows that touch yeah

2723
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,199
it's a vehicle for for change but it

2724
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,280
affects a lot of different things

2725
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,440
and it's things that we might not yeah

2726
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,040
when we're examining someone in clinic

2727
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,960
we're not thinking like

2728
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,520
is this you know rewarding or are we

2729
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,600
making the bird song with the two birds

2730
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,560
kind of

2731
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,520
um doing it it's something that we

2732
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,000
we innately do i don't think we

2733
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,119
specifically always focus on

2734
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,960
that all the different effects and i

2735
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,560
think it's nice to see an overview of

2736
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,040
touch is not so simple i think it shows

2737
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,040
very clearly that touch is not just

2738
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,280
touch um you might

2739
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,760
it's not just you touch someone you are

2740
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,199
affecting lots of different things or

2741
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,360
can affect lots of different things

2742
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,080
depending on how you use it um

2743
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,040
so

2744
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,280
it's just one vehicle for change but it

2745
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,159
can

2746
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:51,199
affect a lot of um different things um i

2747
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,800
liked

2748
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,560
doing it to show all just how varied um

2749
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,320
it can be and how it can be manipulated

2750
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,639
for lots of different things um the

2751
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:01,679
second

2752
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,560
one again like george said it's not so

2753
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,400
sort of scientific it does

2754
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,480
i think it

2755
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,840
it shows

2756
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,760
very well that touch

2757
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,159
is used through the sort of holding of

2758
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,159
hands in the middle but

2759
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:17,920
that's not the main thing

2760
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,400
um it shows i like how

2761
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,679
um we tried to show the different sort

2762
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,320
of aspects of each other so what the

2763
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,480
sort of practitioner might be thinking

2764
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,280
towards what the patient could interpret

2765
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,920
the same thing as very different so you

2766
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,880
see

2767
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,119
um with like b they're trying to help

2768
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:39,600
and console and c they're trying to move

2769
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,760
around but then on the other side you've

2770
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,280
got like

2771
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,239
g

2772
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,880
where you know maybe they think that

2773
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,639
the practitioner might be like yeah

2774
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,480
thinking oh okay this injury you know in

2775
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,320
a few weeks time they'll be getting back

2776
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,199
on their feet they're getting

2777
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,520
strengthening we can start doing rehab

2778
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,520
but really actually the other one could

2779
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,199
be thinking gee like oh no i'm gonna be

2780
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:02,800
stuck in a wheelchair forever um

2781
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,480
the same thing i like how it shows the

2782
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,080
same thing can be interpreted in many

2783
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,080
different ways depending on the prize

2784
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,440
and everything that we've been talking

2785
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,800
about it's not

2786
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,560
the the communication the way things are

2787
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,400
interpreted can be interpreted things

2788
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,400
very differently with the same stimulus

2789
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,920
um and i think that's what we try to

2790
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,719
show

2791
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,880
or hopefully we try to show that

2792
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,000
active inference is a lot more

2793
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
inclusive of lots of different things

2794
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,560
that might be going on in treatment

2795
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,880
um rather than just

2796
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,119
one thing that you know just get them

2797
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:36,320
better it's not

2798
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,760
not not so simple there's a lot of

2799
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,000
things going on that we've

2800
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,800
tried to include

2801
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,000
well on the theme of the same stimuli or

2802
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,239
observation resulting in different

2803
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,080
implications for different individuals

2804
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,320
when i saw the handshake and the symbol

2805
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,400
in the middle i thought of the dna

2806
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,280
double helix and of like a sort of

2807
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,679
feeling touched because it's more like a

2808
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,400
brainwave synchrony

2809
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,639
telepathy situation

2810
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,320
otherwise their bodies would have been

2811
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,800
touching so i think that's an awesome

2812
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,199
conversation this was a great

2813
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:15,199
um addition to the work itself

2814
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,679
and we're really looking forward to

2815
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,679
uh 44.2

2816
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,679
next week at the same time so we'll look

2817
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,119
forward to seeing everybody then again

2818
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,719
thank you very much

2819
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,600
see ya thank you

2820
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,000
you
