28100	29384	A	0.9103710651397705	Hello and welcome, everyone.
29502	36010	A	0.8872362971305847	It's ActInf Lab Livestream number 44.2, and it's May 25, 2022.
36620	38644	A	0.5484262108802795	Welcome to the ActInf lab.

60820	68740	A	0.8069217205047607	If you want to learn more about the live streams or any other projects at Active Inferencelab, check out activeinference.org.
69800	85384	A	0.873687207698822	Okay, today in 44.2, we are in our third discussion around the paper, therapeutic alliance as Active Inference the Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony from 2022 by the authors listed here.
85502	92968	A	0.9087949395179749	And Ian and I had a dot zero where we contextualized and went over some of the outline of the paper.
93134	102620	A	0.9652615189552307	Then we had a great discussion last week with several of the authors in the dot one, and today we're here with some of the authors, and we'll see who else joins.
103120	107120	A	0.85609370470047	And we'll be continuing that discussion around the paper.
107270	112592	A	0.6316683292388916	We left a few threads, but also we can just take it wherever people would like to go.
112726	115668	A	0.5498334169387817	And we'll begin just by saying hello.
115754	118756	A	0.667673647403717	People can say anything they want.
118858	122580	A	0.7714197635650635	And how is this week different than last week?
122730	125392	A	0.8775460124015808	How are we approaching this paper differently?
125456	136136	A	0.7721609473228455	Or what would we like to resolve or address in this two that was stimulated by the dot one or that we didn't get to in the one?
136238	138488	A	0.64227694272995	Feel free to add anything in that area.
138654	140480	A	0.7875402569770813	So, I'm Daniel.
140580	160112	A	0.872046709060669	I'm a researcher in California, and one piece in the two that I'd like to explore would be what are the entities that we're discussing here at what scales, and how to think about that in terms of their generative model and so on.
160246	162160	A	0.8164743781089783	And I'll pass to Ian.
167780	168530	B	0.5208579897880554	Hello.
169460	170508	B	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
170604	184052	B	0.8819884657859802	And yes, I would like to maybe pick up on if we've got time on the topic of synchrony this week and what types of synchrony might we be talking about?
184186	199560	B	0.918091356754303	What things might be oscillating that come into sort of phase lock between two agents that have the potential to synchronize and then where do they head towards with their synchrony?
200380	216060	B	0.8864657878875732	And then if we've got time, thinking about tying this all back to some of the core ideas about minimizing free energy and what does that mean in a therapeutic setting?
218900	219360	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
219430	220272	B	0.7222145199775696	That's it, I think.
220326	221170	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
222100	222896	A	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
223078	226050	A	0.5044499039649963	All right, any of the authors, feel free to go for it.
229620	231670	C	0.7463677525520325	Zoe, play this first.
238600	240736	C	0.8170789480209351	Okay, so I'm George.
240848	242952	C	0.7462432980537415	I'm one of the authors on this paper.
243086	245940	C	0.8720139861106873	I'm an osteopath and researcher.
246020	250712	C	0.8430144786834717	And where do I see this going forward?
250846	262520	C	0.9895128607749939	I pretty much enjoyed the interaction we had last week and very happy to kind of be left by you guys, Ian and Daniel, and anybody else that want to join.
262600	278284	C	0.5524563789367676	I think we can definitely explore those ideas about the synchronization to agents, and arguably more than two agents when we operate in a kind of not in a diadic setting, but actually in a triadic setting.
278332	288372	C	0.8264800310134888	For example, pediatric care, kind of elderly care and so on, actually, there's an additional agent in the whole thing.
288426	291588	C	0.7581216096878052	So what do I look forward to?
291594	302650	C	0.6102609634399414	The discussion kind of stimulate some ideas about ways in which we can move forward with this to the more empirical state of the research.
305590	306062	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
306136	306950	A	0.6662225723266602	Zoe.
308810	310322	D	0.7027174830436707	Hi, I'm Zoe.
310466	316600	D	0.8662149906158447	I'm an Osteopath as well, based in Singapore, and I'm the primary author for this paper.
317210	323686	D	0.9311562776565552	Yeah, happy to be led by anyone that wants to where we want to go, but definitely happy to talk about synchrony.
323798	334686	D	0.49782830476760864	I think, as George said, it would be important to talk about not just diadic, but triadic or otherwise, because I think that adds a lot of depth to it.
334708	342560	D	0.582181990146637	But also it's easier to sort of discuss the effects of synchrony and also the fact that you can be.
346450	348880	A	0.5188238024711609	Okay, lost Zoe for a second.
351570	353966	D	0.8128458261489868	Anyone that wants to ask questions.
354148	354542	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
354596	360130	A	0.8985996246337891	Also, Zoe, is there, like, any other microphone to use, or could you speak closer to the microphone?
363750	367006	D	0.7013056874275208	I'm just using my laptop, so there isn't really a microphone.
367118	372114	D	0.6120547652244568	I can take my headphones off if that makes a difference.
372312	372914	A	0.5681877732276917	It's fine.
372952	374900	A	0.6378321051597595	It's just a little quiet, but it's fine.
376470	377038	D	0.584351658821106	Okay.
377144	377750	D	0.509212851524353	Sorry.
377900	379414	A	0.8021313548088074	Oh, no, it's totally all good.
379452	380438	A	0.7628719210624695	Just want us to check.
380524	381254	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
381452	382054	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
382092	387100	A	0.8107089400291443	Let us pick up with the synchrony then.
387550	404080	A	0.898055374622345	So I guess just to kind of recall, how was this question of synchrony approached in the active inference literature and maybe even outside of the active inference literature, and then how was synchrony approached in this paper?
404850	411860	A	0.7787757515907288	Why was that such a core topic in this approach that the authors took?
415830	429366	D	0.6640987396240234	I think we started with synchrony as the main part, mainly because when we were talking about the therapeutic alliance, synchrony and getting on with the other person is kind of key.
429468	438886	D	0.5434378385543823	And the way that we approached this paper, primarily in terms of a lot of the aspects of how we achieved that good therapeutic alliance was through synchrony.
438998	444886	D	0.8715196251869202	So that's kind of where that's one of the reasons through active inference.
445078	468418	D	0.8771280646324158	It was also about I started the research when I was looking at it right from sort of the start and looking at how communication worked and why people would want to sort of synchronize together and why people to implement active inference into sort of the structure that we had.
468584	497600	D	0.7731338143348694	It was important to kind of see why that would be beneficial because we wanted to use or we like to say that the synchrony enables us to work together to then therefore save free energy, be more efficient, and then that's how we very much used it to apply this active inference sort of framework around it.
498210	504030	D	0.7948455810546875	And so I felt that it was very key without the synchrony element.
505170	514370	D	0.8911803960800171	It was kind of the backbone into which a lot of the aspects of active inference in the way that we achieve therapeutic alliance seemed to sort of center around.
514440	530498	D	0.5855307579040527	Without that connection between the different people, we wouldn't be able to save energy to work together, to have a better relationship with our practitioners, with the patients and practitioner.
530514	535930	D	0.6177388429641724	We wouldn't be able to get the clinical applications and benefits from it.
536080	545574	D	0.8986341953277588	So I saw synchrony as sort of the key medal to sort of get to where the sort of paper was.
545632	553360	D	0.7587421536445618	So it was sort of a key concept to use in order to implement it all together.
555010	555870	D	0.6141266822814941	George.
557730	579910	C	0.8691468238830566	Yeah, let's say when we started the project actually kind of putting some ideas along the lines of how could we apply predictive processing and the free energy active inference within osteopathy and within the osteopathic setting.
580970	606170	C	0.7418640851974487	Synchrony came along actually after the initial discussion with Karl Frieston that kind of suggested know look into this stuff because actually could be quite a robust way of understanding what goes on in the clinic room when two people are working together with a specific kind of aim.
607070	630680	C	0.8216468691825867	There is a little bit of literature in psychotherapy kind of demonstrating that actually the therapeutic alliance becomes much more robust when two people synchronize and both at the kind of behavioral but also biological level.
631770	652954	C	0.6061795353889465	And it was nothing about sort of okay, this is about pure verbal communication, nonverbal but primarily by kind of copying body movements and so on to think, okay, how can this be applied in the context of actually an approach that is largely hands on based as a manual therapy?
653082	655582	C	0.8287277817726135	So that's where it kind of started from.
655716	669406	C	0.8004911541938782	It was one way of trying, like Zoe said, kind of looking at therapeutic alliance when people interact to try and understand what goes on in the diadic setting.
669598	683240	C	0.8062170147895813	Kind of two people but also a little bit beyond of what happens when there's actually more people involved in that therapeutic relationship that need to be consulted, need to be involved in the process and so on.
685870	688170	C	0.7952075600624084	That was the kind of early stage.
690430	709650	C	0.7207515239715576	And then we thought that actually this is a good way of understanding a little bit more about how we can create the conditions of developing a strong kind of ecological niche that is based on that synchrony of that sort of understanding of that give and take.
709720	714046	C	0.8765104413032532	Like a little bit like we talked about last week, the kind of the Bird song.
714238	721598	C	0.8344600796699524	People taking turns, kind of understanding, listening, okay, acting kind of taking on, go back and so on.
721624	728002	C	0.6838854551315308	And that's sort of, in a sense, like kind of a nice wave that goes back and forth.
728066	732610	C	0.9286115765571594	But it is a kind of very nice and tranquil kind of wave.
732770	747626	C	0.5820057392120361	Not a one that just crashes and destroys everything, but actually one where once that kind of goes on a little bit like the pendulum kind of analogy once you introduce that nice pendulum kind of things happen.
747808	755360	C	0.853376567363739	That's where we sort of thought it could be one way of exploring the whole process of care.
757650	759310	A	0.8833861947059631	Thank you, Ian.
762210	763200	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
765430	780262	B	0.8880391716957092	I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony and the little bits I've read in the literature about how measurable things that might be able to synchronize between one or two or more people.
780396	783978	B	0.895419716835022	So, Daniel, I think we discussed this in the zero.
784064	794970	B	0.6514192223548889	So choirs singing together, they have been shown their heart rates kind of synchronize with their breathing.
796350	804350	B	0.8698311448097229	And I think in the paper there was some references cited for similar sort of stuff in drumming circles, for example.
804500	823570	B	0.8718351721763611	So that really interests me and I can kind of begin to see how in a therapeutic setting, that kind of synchrony could lead someone who's maybe stressed and anxious into a kind of more healthy increased parasympathetic activity and that is conducive to healing.
825350	843670	B	0.8190410733222961	But I've also got these other sort of nagging things about synchrony as well that maybe I touched on the dot zero, which is what are we synchronizing towards and is it always beneficial?
843750	850990	B	0.6777833104133606	So the less kind of lockstep synchrony that you talked about, Daniel.
851650	859710	B	0.7608320713043213	So maybe it's just, let's say a child saying, mummy, mummy, mummy, waving their arms around and then the mum synchronize, they synchronize their attention together.
859860	863134	B	0.5975555777549744	So you get mother and child and then you've got a choice.
863182	865410	B	0.7955983877182007	So there's some aspect that's synchronized.
865910	875138	B	0.8793386816978455	I think in the paper it talked about the arms and the limbs and the voice kind of synchronizing and the facial expressions.
875234	884486	B	0.5723394751548767	But a caregiver might then lead the child to a soothing kind of parasympathetic way soothe it.
884508	893782	B	0.6886529922485352	Or it might say, give it a clip behind the ear and say, children us to be seen and not heard and try and stop the attention.
893926	901690	B	0.5451881289482117	The attention is synchronized, but the action may not be therapeutic.
903790	923694	B	0.6711156368255615	Yeah, I'm just sort of thinking about where you know, where just because something's synchronized, does it mean it's always minimizing free energy or just because things in the therapeutic world go in and out of fashion?
923742	927106	B	0.5398717522621155	So frontal lobotomy is okay, we don't do that anymore.
927138	933370	B	0.6171541810035706	But for a while there was some kind of synchronized thinking in the therapeutic world that that's a good idea for people.
933440	957440	B	0.7072440981864929	And there are ideas that I hear in the wider kind of therapy world that are fashionable and they're being applied, but in 50 years time we may look that they may have been leading people away from minimizing free energy or improving health.
961410	962430	B	0.718904435634613	My thoughts.
962850	963262	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
963316	963582	A	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
963636	964450	A	0.7309767007827759	Yeah, a lot there.
964520	965250	A	0.6141266822814941	George.
967190	973240	C	0.4709135890007019	I think the interesting thing, there are nagging questions there for sure.
974330	986810	C	0.5532448291778564	The first one, do we always synchronize and when if you don't synchronize what we're going to do, because clearly there are cases where we know the therapeutic relationship is going nowhere.
987310	995718	C	0.6042982339859009	We can say whatever we can, try our best, but actually, there is resistance to change from the patients.
995814	999054	C	0.9448254108428955	We end up not understanding each other.
999252	1004042	C	0.7907798886299133	And arguably, that's a relationship that will not evolve.
1004186	1007070	C	0.7866286635398865	And, well, you might even get to a point at the end.
1007140	1009902	C	0.6414085626602173	Maybe it'd be a good idea to go and see a colleague of mine kind of thing.
1009956	1013298	C	0.8586282134056091	Okay, so do we synchronize with everybody?
1013384	1014740	C	0.5576795339584351	No, clearly not.
1016310	1038442	C	0.777986466884613	Is there any value understanding this stuff by sometimes understanding that some kind of gestures and sort of body language and so on, voice, sound, sort of communication style, we're probably giving us cues maybe to adapt a little bit to try and synchronize a little bit better.
1038496	1039814	C	0.8164113759994507	I think that's useful.
1039862	1043798	C	0.8310708999633789	I think important in order to be a good communicator.
1043894	1054878	C	0.5515598058700562	I think first and foremost, sometimes people worry too much about the technical skills and the ability of doing X and Y and doing some miracles and so on.
1054964	1062002	C	0.8429007530212402	Arguably the first thing that people need to be in a clinical setting is good communicator and a pretty good, nice person.
1062056	1062274	C	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
1062312	1077798	C	0.4763682782649994	And I think if that's there, I think we create the conditions in good communicators likely to have potentially better outcomes that guys that basically don't care and sort of they're the experts and so on.
1077964	1081638	C	0.7906427979469299	The other question is, is it always about minimizing free energy?
1081724	1089274	C	0.6303965449333191	Because there are situations where probably you want to short circuit the whole thing, isn't it?
1089392	1093354	C	0.80289226770401	You want to sort of flatten a little bit of that sort of sensory state.
1093472	1113060	C	0.451299786567688	You want to create a condition where the only way you can sort of change the generative model is actually by creating a massive surprise, a massive prediction error that arguably surprises the system in a way like, wow, what just happened?
1113590	1127880	C	0.5662298798561096	And actually, oh, okay, I don't think it's always about minimizing free energy, but sometimes I think you want to shock the whole thing because the system on the other side wants to minimize free energy for sure.
1129210	1142266	C	0.5761221051216125	If I'm a kind of chronic pain patient and I'm scared of moving and you tell me to move and so on, the reaction is I anticipate the likelihood of movement leading to pain.
1142368	1148254	C	0.8395257592201233	I anticipate the consequences of actions in the future, the typical active inference model.
1148372	1150558	C	0.726636528968811	And I lock, I don't move.
1150644	1164370	C	0.663524329662323	So I probably want to short circuit the whole thing to create a condition where it's actually okay to move because it's not going to cause any harm, is it, through synchrony?
1165830	1166878	C	0.6499896049499512	Maybe it isn't.
1166974	1174614	C	0.5275416374206543	Okay, so I think that's not, I think, a kind of one size fits all kind of thing.
1174812	1200240	C	0.6428103446960449	And I don't think it's just about sort of always that minimizing free energy because I think creating change that is meaningful change probably needs a little bit more of it needs to destroy that sort of strong prior kind of thing so I can implant another chip kind of thing in a metaphorical way.
1201490	1213326	C	0.559032678604126	And that's why we know in some mental health conditions why some types of drugs like catamine and so on, create that condition that sort of zeros.
1213358	1215986	C	0.53745436668396	The whole thing is a bit like you reset the button, isn't it?
1216008	1217166	C	0.8313437104225159	The computer is stuck.
1217278	1219442	C	0.6377063989639282	What you do, you've tried everything.
1219496	1222034	C	0.626789391040802	You unplug the computer and then you try again.
1222072	1223602	C	0.7451433539390564	The whole thing reboots, isn't it?
1223656	1231890	C	0.8809720277786255	So I think sometimes that's the analogy of maybe what we want to achieve in the setting is it through synchrony?
1232230	1235900	C	0.5704531073570251	I personally, I don't know, and I'm not entirely sure.
1237390	1244138	C	0.6445552110671997	Of course, if the people started understanding each other, then that creates the conditions for this thing probably to happen.
1244224	1252814	C	0.548029899597168	Because if you don't understand me as a practitioner, I don't understand you as a patient, it's pretty hard that actually I create the condition for change.
1252852	1258000	C	0.8497907519340515	So maybe it's through synchrony, but again, as a sort of big question marks, really.
1261170	1261920	A	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
1262710	1263122	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1263176	1264180	A	0.7817966938018799	Zoe, please.
1266230	1273650	D	0.8343817591667175	Yeah, so I think going off what I mean, overall, the goal would be to minimize free energy.
1273720	1279798	D	0.8329333066940308	But to be able to do that, you have to sort of at some point challenge it, right?
1279884	1284198	D	0.4979894161224365	You're not going to have the same belief that you think is the most efficient.
1284374	1294746	D	0.718023955821991	When you're born to when you die, the way that you become reduced energy is going to change over time.
1294848	1297366	D	0.8037588596343994	You'll see that especially in sort of pediatrics.
1297398	1298810	D	0.7328347563743591	You see it in sport.
1299230	1308494	D	0.7853270769119263	There's a lot of studies with running, for example, that show that the more you run, often the more mileage that people do when they run, the more efficient they get.
1308612	1316130	D	0.7450175285339355	So I think free energy is, yes, we all want to reduce it, but at some point we've got to update it and challenge it, right?
1316200	1322098	D	0.7849767208099365	So it won't be sort of just this linear thing where you're constantly just changing it.
1322104	1324066	D	0.8122097849845886	You've got to update it and challenge it at some point.
1324088	1336220	D	0.6382077932357788	So it will sort of be a little bit of a roller coaster and have a few dips where you got to take that risk to see if there's another way that is more efficient, that will save it more.
1337150	1342378	D	0.793606698513031	Whether synchrony is always necessary, I'm not sure.
1342544	1363362	D	0.6545227766036987	I definitely think that when you're unsure whether or if your prior is not so precise and you're not 100% sure that that is the best way to do whatever you're doing, or you're not 100% certain that your belief explains what's going on, then I think you're more likely to synchronize with others.
1363416	1373874	D	0.4872549772262573	I think once you're quite certain on what you think and what you're going to do, then it's a lot harder to synchronize.
1374002	1383334	D	0.6869032382965088	Like with the cognitive sort of immunity when you've got chronic pain, it's a lot harder to change that because you're convinced that you're right.
1383372	1387722	D	0.7055062651634216	You've had this pain for years, maybe, and you know what it's like.
1387776	1389990	D	0.8265362977981567	If you bend forward, it's going to hurt.
1390070	1392940	D	0.5039457082748413	So why would you bother to challenge that?
1395970	1407230	D	0.6110665798187256	I think there's a lot of studies that show that, especially with sort of babies, that they synchronize with their when they're younger the synchrony is very consistent.
1408210	1416414	D	0.7928140163421631	Obviously they need to work with their caregiver to get their alleystatic needs and everything that they need to keep surviving.
1416462	1426482	D	0.7729976773262024	But it shows that they do still think when they're adults but the time when they're older or in adulthood that they do think is when they're unsure.
1426626	1435830	D	0.8344263434410095	When something happens and you are near that caregiver and you don't know, you still sort of rely on them.
1435900	1441402	D	0.5820554494857788	Say I don't know, you get into a car accident or something and there's a big shock and you're not sure.
1441536	1450714	D	0.6758916974067688	Often the child will still, no matter how old they are, will look to the parent, obviously unless the parent is very elderly.
1450762	1455760	D	0.852706253528595	But generally speaking in times of uncertainty you will look towards someone else.
1456450	1459930	D	0.8536217212677002	So I think is synchrony always necessary?
1460010	1476840	D	0.826871395111084	No but I think if you're not 100% certain with your priors and you are questioning it or there is a doubt of that questioning it, then I think synchrony will play more of a role in it and I'll pass it back to you.
1477690	1478966	A	0.9686442017555237	Awesome, thanks.
1479068	1484242	A	0.8753715753555298	Yeah, just thinking about beliefs in the way that we might talk about them.
1484396	1485094	A	0.6567496657371521	Hey, blue.
1485142	1485690	A	0.7317204475402832	Welcome.
1485840	1488886	A	0.8773994445800781	Just the way that we might conversationally talk about beliefs.
1488998	1496182	A	0.8302823305130005	If somebody is unsure about something that's when they look to be synchronized by some other informational resource.
1496246	1505338	A	0.7076737880706787	I'm not sure what time this thing opens so I'm going to look it up in this way or I'm going to ask this person or I'm not sure where to go so I'm going to follow the crowd.
1505434	1512286	A	0.8200711607933044	We see that kind of in the ant pheromone trail, we see that in the social media, all these different areas.
1512318	1555518	A	0.793220579624176	And then conversely when somebody does have a more confident, more built up prior then that's more like going their own way and potentially being more resistant to external contrasting information and then translating from that one conversational meaning of belief like I believe that is going to open at this time into a broader Bayesian perspective on Bayesian brain and body and thinking about pain and perception as also parameters that can be seen as beliefs in this Bayesian sense.
1555604	1571586	A	0.874050498008728	So not always like a psychological experienced belief but in some statistical way it's like they're held stances that are updated in some way or partially or completely by certain kinds of incoming information.
1571768	1582534	A	0.8648821711540222	So Ian and then also this is going to be I think very interesting to return to the free energy minimization and unpack what we mean by free energy there.
1582572	1583154	A	0.7409442067146301	So Ian.
1583202	1583960	A	0.7154298424720764	Go for.
1586410	1586966	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
1587068	1596506	B	0.8754011988639832	So, yeah, I'm just sort of wanting to check that some of the language used in other realms of therapy.
1596538	1620738	B	0.705045223236084	So this idea of self regulation and co regulation, are we saying here that this synchrony in the therapeutic reliance is a form of co regulation that we hear a lot about in people with disorder problems of their autonomic nervous system?
1620824	1626838	B	0.8775500655174255	And then we say, you go to a therapist to help co regulate your autonomic nervous system.
1626924	1641210	B	0.7461056113243103	Is that what we're saying as synchrony is the kind of mechanism for co regulation which I believe fits with what you're saying, zoe that children need that more and as adults we might do that occasionally.
1642110	1648214	B	0.8778014779090881	And then I'm just thinking also other forms of therapeutic synchrony and co regulation.
1648262	1674214	B	0.6432251334190369	So meeting friends for a you know, I might be having a bit of a stressful week or a wobble in some way, and then I meet some friends and we kind of seek counsel in each other, have a synchronize our movement of our hands to our mouth with a coffee cup or listen to some music together, tap our feet together.
1674332	1677874	B	0.6601066589355469	And that's a kind of therapeutic.
1677922	1682680	B	0.841930627822876	So are we all kind of doing this on and off all the time?
1684590	1686780	B	0.8150472640991211	They're my thoughts or questions.
1689310	1689674	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1689712	1691946	A	0.8505019545555115	George zoe, then?
1691968	1692570	A	0.6141266822814941	George.
1695390	1695802	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1695856	1697210	D	0.5778552293777466	No, I just wanted to say yes.
1697280	1699242	D	0.7378479242324829	With the co regulation.
1699306	1720500	D	0.6651419401168823	I think that we kind of not always but I think we do add an element to try and suggest that we'd like to say that we in part help co regulation and as a practitioner to achieve sort of recovery and reduce pain and help.
1721190	1742298	D	0.8585866689682007	I think we all want to say that we help in that process and that we help regulate their sort of disruptive pattern, whether that's inflammation, whether that's pain, whatever sort of metric that you want to rate your treatment by or whatever your treatment goals are that you're sort of working towards.
1742384	1756480	D	0.8934272527694702	I think we all want to say that we sort of help regulate which ways we regulate in terms of whether we actually change their heart rate or things like that.
1758130	1763074	D	0.6860249042510986	We're not always so specific about we don't have the research to kind of show that.
1763112	1780278	D	0.8321214318275452	But I think certainly there is elements of sympathetic and parasympathetic things that we do, as well as sort of the intent to co regulate even if we don't sort of empirically do it or achieve it.
1780364	1799920	D	0.7921906113624573	Whether just that reassurance that we're attempting to help regulate their pain, I think is sort of the intention that I hope that as a practitioner I am giving off to my patients and I'll let George speak.
1804610	1832370	C	0.8601346611976624	I think if you come from a manual therapy background, a touch based, hands on approach, one could argue, or old school kind of beliefs in the profession, christian Osteopathy would argue that actually how you achieve that core regulation, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic parasympathetic is primarily through the use of techniques.
1832450	1852960	C	0.8377653956413269	You use a technique in a particular part of the body and this affects the parasympathetic part and so on the vagus nerve and all that stuff that sort of implies there is a tool by which you can apply that stuff, treat that particular bit and by miracle modulate everything.
1853650	1867310	C	0.5668897032737732	I used to be there, no longer there because the evidence isn't strong enough to actually support those clients on the other hand, if we add another element, which is the element the synchrony.
1867470	1884306	C	0.7366610169410706	And the synchrony here goes beyond just that sort of passive practitioner led type of intervention into something that implies communication, implies alignment attuning to the environment.
1884418	1887434	C	0.707821786403656	And the environment there is the practitioner as well.
1887552	1892074	C	0.8025818467140198	So the other person in the room, the guy that is facilitating the process.
1892192	1900174	C	0.7884548902511597	So it sort of takes us, I think, away from this idea that everything is about touches, everything is about the manual stuff and so on.
1900292	1908446	C	0.6716375350952148	But it becomes a kind of a multipronged approach where touch matters, that communication matters as much as touch.
1908628	1916722	C	0.6569333672523499	And it's not a technique X, Y or NZ, but it's actually the whole package of care that's likely to enable us to get there.
1916856	1923926	C	0.6352787613868713	So is it similar I like your analogy to sort of tough day and so on.
1923948	1939740	C	0.7069413065910339	You go out, you need to see your friends, you need to synchronize in a different environment because ultimately people will talk to each other and correlate regulate each other even in terms of reducing allostatic load of a tough week and so on.
1940510	1945446	C	0.8895061016082764	There are kind of things that are similar to what happens in the clinical setting.
1945558	1949360	C	0.8853346705436707	One of them, we're probably thinking about reward systems as well.
1949890	1957950	C	0.6800690293312073	There's a sort of a participation in something that is likely to, even if uncomfortable, is let is going to lead to some improvement.
1959810	1975080	C	0.6902688145637512	Maybe there's some dopamine stuff, maybe there is a reward pathways that are kind of involved in the whole thing, like having a drink in the same having a therapeutic intervention that ultimately is going to get me to a better state.
1975530	1998720	C	0.795711874961853	I think it's very analogous to moving away from the free energy principle and to an area that kind of works alongside that inactivism, the concept of sense making, what inactivists would argue participatory sense making.
1999170	2005578	C	0.8489366769790649	So synchrony could be kind of also looked from that lens, from that perspective.
2005754	2024070	C	0.5891552567481995	Whereas two people or more than two people either in a group having a drink and all kind of helping each other because I listen, or in a therapeutic setting that sort of participatory things, making minimizing free energy or autopoeasies for the kind of the inactivists.
2025050	2034730	C	0.8464011549949646	Actually, I think we sort of looking at the same phenomena, maybe with different language, but arguably the same kind of phenomena.
2035710	2044650	C	0.5253141522407532	I think it's that package that probably helps core regulation rather than just one intervention.
2045810	2048830	A	0.9037600755691528	Thank you, Blue.
2049170	2049920	A	0.7317204475402832	Welcome.
2050530	2054000	A	0.8816223740577698	Do you want to add anything or ask anything?
2056370	2059854	F	0.9555121064186096	Not right off the bat, just hi, it's nice to be here with you guys.
2059892	2064130	F	0.7707187533378601	I'm sorry I missed last week and I've really enjoyed the discussions of the paper so far.
2064200	2066754	F	0.7279476523399353	And I'll jump in, in a little bit.
2066792	2070370	F	0.9581460356712341	I think you guys were engrossed in a good conversation.
2072090	2073046	A	0.9497865438461304	Okay, awesome.
2073148	2078278	A	0.9148587584495544	So the Dopamine angle and a few other things we'll return to.
2078364	2099182	A	0.5096343159675598	But we were talking about minimizing free energy and I wanted to show a few images from the textbook because even those who have seen free energy come up in a lot of different settings, sometimes returning to the basics is a generator that helps us take it in many other ways.
2099316	2112462	A	0.7205012440681458	And for those who are maybe focused more on the clinical setting or have more of that background, this can provide a little other tissues around the connective tissue.
2112526	2115762	A	0.5058304667472839	Free energy is being used like a connective tissue here.
2115816	2117678	A	0.5346565842628479	It's bridging a lot of different ideas.
2117774	2122226	A	0.77874356508255	It's helping us connect different sensory modalities and therapeutic modalities.
2122418	2127058	A	0.9383431673049927	So just a few cool images from the active inference textbook.
2127234	2151306	A	0.8566916584968567	So here is Figure 2.3 and it's the action perception loop and the two ways that discrepancies related to predictions or expectations, the two ways that discrepancies about observations can be reduced just qualitatively is through changing belief and changing action.
2151498	2158454	A	0.8991430401802063	And it's some blend of those two that individual entities are engaged in in this action perception loop.
2158602	2188300	A	0.7705538272857666	And then when we're specifically talking about free energy, there's some type of equation, this is like a simple form of it that is going to make that discrepancy minimization tractable and possible to calculate for at least us doing statistics from outside the system, if not for the system itself to do.
2188910	2194902	A	0.7726892232894897	And what is the real sort of hidden goal?
2194966	2197898	A	0.772326648235321	Is this minimization of true surprise.
2198074	2203850	A	0.5534759163856506	But the minimization of true surprise is intractable or it's inaccessible.
2204010	2208054	A	0.813321053981781	And so free energy serves as like this upper bound.
2208202	2219726	A	0.7338234186172485	Whereas if we can reduce this upper bound, we're getting implicitly closer to this asymptotic reduction of surprise.
2219918	2231750	A	0.8011983633041382	So who is doing this reduction of surprise that relates to the entity question what is the entity that's actually doing free energy minimization?
2232330	2237260	A	0.8465448021888733	And so what are the entities that we're talking about here?
2238430	2242060	A	0.7499894499778748	What does it mean to minimize free energy?
2244910	2254106	A	0.7658557295799255	I liked how earlier it was brought up when sometimes where that free energy minimization was going with the flow and then sometimes when there was a flow disrupt.
2254218	2259858	A	0.8998249173164368	So what is free energy minimization and what are the entities and how are we modeling that?
2259944	2261860	A	0.8296623229980469	Ian and then anyone else?
2265670	2266420	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
2266790	2275842	B	0.877151370048523	Yeah, that question of what are the entities and linking it back to George's point about sense making and inactivism.
2275906	2294858	B	0.9667671918869019	So in the paper there was some really interesting stuff on realizing that we're all alike in the therapeutic alliance and relating that back to sense making.
2295024	2309762	B	0.7222583889961243	I'm thinking that therapeutically or in a manual therapy or meeting friends, the outcome might be I'm not a weirdo, I haven't done anything wrong, everything's okay.
2309816	2314574	B	0.9528613090515137	Again, I'm relaxed and that's therapeutic.
2314702	2318898	B	0.5295627117156982	So I'm amongst people who are very much alike me.
2319064	2320370	B	0.7054368853569031	And that's the sense making.
2320440	2322146	B	0.7486430406570435	There's the pattern recognition.
2322338	2326600	B	0.8578340411186218	I'm a valuable member of my tribe, however you want to describe it.
2331210	2334470	B	0.6784796118736267	But we're never completely identical.
2335850	2336710	B	0.7365487217903137	Or are we?
2336780	2337720	B	0.566673219203949	I don't know.
2340830	2344694	B	0.5184190273284912	The proposal in the paper is that that's the ultimate realization that we're all alike.
2344742	2345774	B	0.7729187607765198	And I can kind of see.
2345812	2348910	B	0.8186389207839966	That that's a kind of relieving thing to realize.
2350050	2352080	B	0.7029415965080261	But we're similar.
2354130	2367380	B	0.6610915064811707	I'm similar to my pet dog in that I've got eyes and I breathe and my heart beats and I can synchronize in some ways with that, and it feels nice, but my dog can't help me do my accounts, for example.
2368630	2372670	B	0.49899399280548096	So, yes, this alikeness.
2372750	2376420	B	0.594438374042511	And how does that fit into sense making?
2378550	2379970	A	0.7864034175872803	Thanks, Blue.
2380870	2385850	F	0.7979493141174316	So, as I've been reading the textbook, I've been thinking a lot about the hidden states.
2385920	2393740	F	0.676496684551239	And it's interesting to think about that in terms of using touch to kind of resolve uncertainty about the hidden states.
2394110	2409620	F	0.6443972587585449	Because while a state might be hidden to the patient, when you present with some, like, I've got a pain in my shoulder or something like that, it might be easy for the therapist to say, oh, that's this, this, and I push here and tweak this, and then it's better.
2410950	2422142	F	0.7248109579086304	So it might be hidden to the patient but not hidden to the doctor, or hidden to the doctor and the patient, or hidden to the patient but not the doctor, or the doctor but not the patient.
2422206	2424054	F	0.7449795007705688	So it might be like all of these things.
2424092	2429334	F	0.7547605633735657	And so it's like working together, this kind of synchrony to resolve uncertainty about a hidden state.
2429372	2438218	F	0.7903236150741577	And I've thought a lot about who's making the observation and who's doing the state observing and who is the state hidden to.
2438304	2450126	F	0.5487101674079895	And it brings back the paper that you guys mentioned in the zero the communication as active inference because it really is like a bi directional, harmonious kind of thing happening.
2450228	2450880	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2451490	2452334	A	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
2452532	2453278	A	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
2453444	2454160	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
2454610	2455550	A	0.6141266822814941	George.
2461110	2461860	D	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2463110	2469502	C	0.8657304048538208	So actually, starting with the hidden states, who's observing, who's been observed?
2469646	2484714	C	0.8947672247886658	I think the free energy model or picture the typical representation with the two agents and or one agent in the world and internal states, external states and so on.
2484832	2494694	C	0.8407047986984253	If you have the two agents, there's something in the middle that clearly is the ground where we kind of try to achieve some form of alignment.
2494742	2508638	C	0.8326002359390259	And then that sort of implies the reading of someone else's internal state, I think, who makes the observation, who's been observed and so on.
2508724	2533074	C	0.5674903988838196	I think, again, is the birdsong is a give and take because there are clearly situations where you may be telling your patient that actually is nothing to worry about, for example, where you're not particularly sure about what's going on and the patient can clearly read in your body language that, no, it's hiding something from me.
2533132	2533740	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2534350	2537180	C	0.9260067343711853	It's something there that doesn't feel right.
2538110	2538860	C	0.5590490698814392	Actually.
2540430	2559550	C	0.5632529854774475	There's an interesting phenomena, for example, in chronic conditions, which is the concept of cognitive immunization, where it's very common these days for patient goes and sees a practitioner, has read, has consulted with Dr.
2559620	2560750	C	0.7145830392837524	Google to start.
2560900	2561310	C	0.6263067722320557	Dr.
2561380	2566254	C	0.5049358010292053	Google said it could be x, Y, and Z, typically the worst case scenario.
2566382	2569922	C	0.8098500370979309	Goes and sees doctor number one.
2569976	2572674	C	0.7384932041168213	Doctor number one says, yeah, you know what?
2572792	2574022	C	0.6542953252792358	Nothing to worry about.
2574156	2575654	C	0.663574755191803	There's nothing wrong with you.
2575772	2582934	C	0.6445294618606567	Patient has got pain, kind of saying, all right, I don't trust you kind of thing, then goes and sees practitioner number two.
2582972	2607070	C	0.629855215549469	That comes with a different story and yeah, okay, maybe you forget about if forgotten about something goes to practitioner number three and so on and gets through a process where authors argue that the system becomes cognitively immune to any new explanations because the expectation is surely there's something wrong with me.
2607140	2625574	C	0.5264000296592712	So clearly in those conditions, if we take from this lens, one could argue, yeah, as a patient, I'm observing you, I'm kind of reading your internal states, which is I don't trust you kind of thing because you're telling me something, but actually something that potentially you don't believe either, okay.
2625692	2640506	C	0.5673049092292786	Or this thing about, let's do cognitive reassurance because most nonspecific back pain or neck pain, one cannot say that's clearly a particular tissue responsible for the pain, the symptoms and so on.
2640528	2644970	C	0.5443065166473389	So you say, okay, there's nothing serious with you, so what's wrong with me?
2645120	2652846	C	0.9396975040435791	You clearly can't tell the patient you've got nonspecific back pain because for the patient that means you haven't got a clue about what's wrong with me.
2652948	2656526	C	0.6493289470672607	Or you're implying that something upstairs in my head, I'm making it up.
2656628	2666382	C	0.8295028209686279	So patients observe us for sure, and they know when we kind of are confident and so on, and when we're not so confident.
2666446	2669986	C	0.6455944180488586	And maybe we're not entirely sure if actually the whole thing is going to happen.
2670088	2680662	C	0.8514581322669983	In the same way we observe patients, we start observing them when they come through the door, when you first greet them and so on, hi, how are you doing?
2680716	2696060	C	0.6542705297470093	Before COVID times, shaking hands and so on were a pretty good first kind of getting into someone else's internal state because just the handshake, the quality of the amount of pressure, the confidence and so on.
2696530	2701870	C	0.679314136505127	There were cases say this person is anxious, this person is down, is depressed, and so on.
2701940	2712580	C	0.8880787491798401	And you could get that down to when you do clinical examination, you touch, you observe, you feel, you palpate and so on.
2714630	2718130	C	0.5975590348243713	That implies that there is a lot of unconscious stuff.
2718200	2730902	C	0.8177679181098938	That process comes through, arrives through our sensory, our sensorian and we make something out of it.
2730956	2746640	C	0.8624728322029114	So I think that's what we kind of one of the things we try to explore through this stuff about try to understand someone else's internal state, predicting a little bit of their mental state.
2748210	2759380	C	0.5647486448287964	And that's where synchrony and that's where alignment kind of plays that important role because if there's no alignment, I can't clearly guess what's wrong going on.
2760230	2768002	C	0.9410053491592407	The stuff about Ian, what you mentioned about sense making and so on, sense making is quite an interesting thing.
2768056	2775890	C	0.6386212110519409	You said, okay, we're not like a patient is a patient and the practitioner is a practitioner.
2776050	2779830	C	0.7882641553878784	There is that power differential as well.
2779980	2781910	C	0.6726686954498291	There's the doctor, there's the patient.
2782650	2796174	C	0.7974117398262024	When one is an expert and when the other is an expert and things alternate the whole thing about sense making and actually minimization of free energy and so on.
2796292	2815300	C	0.9684855341911316	Sense making is quite an interesting thing too when we look at some clinical conditions and there's some beautiful stuff written about, for example, mental health and inactive approaches and looking at, for example depression as a disorder of sense making, for example.
2816310	2828354	C	0.7604608535766602	And you see that sometimes with patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems that also have a comorbidity they have depression.
2828482	2829814	C	0.8415880799293518	What came first?
2830012	2832840	C	0.5564276576042175	The depression of the back or the back pain?
2833370	2849520	C	0.9218325614929199	One could argue that if I suffer from chronic back pain and I can't get out of the house I can't see my friends, I can't walk my dog, I can't play with my children and so on the world stops kind of making sense, right?
2850130	2857566	C	0.952101469039917	I don't go out because outside is a cruel world and it's kind of full of dangers and so on.
2857588	2871800	C	0.5486613512039185	So I stay in a safe environment which is my home watching telly, kind of complaining about myself to myself and I become depressed because I'm stuck there.
2872250	2905950	C	0.5579305291175842	So the therapeutic encounter that sort of nice ecological niche in a sense creates opportunity for sense making to understand where there's patterns for example, rigid behavior, rigid thinking that actually by understanding, by interacting can potentially start sort of taking the patient in a particular direction which is this kind of road to recovery.
2906930	2923160	C	0.8286853432655334	And one could argue that if someone starts feeling kind of better in themselves symptoms reduce a little bit, can start doing a little bit more, can start again engaging with the world.
2923850	2928838	C	0.46030840277671814	Maybe the other stuff about feeling miserable would get better as well.
2928924	2933010	C	0.7008432149887085	And I think that's sometimes what we see in musculoskeletal care is this stuff.
2933180	2943100	C	0.8066649436950684	We don't treat mental health conditions and I don't think we should make those claims because they're clearly boundaries and competences and so on.
2944030	2963540	C	0.5585594773292542	But the patient that has got, for example, a chronic musculoskeletal problem and gets better and gets an impact that impact changes their quality of life changes their ability to become an agent again because pain they lost their agency because of pain.
2964150	2982454	C	0.8088554739952087	I think that's where the beauty of this understanding this stuff kind of comes is you can impact on different levels of the person of the self that is clearly not just that embodied self, that body but it's beyond that embodied self.
2982572	2988860	C	0.8233382105827332	Is this multidimensional kind of what is to be a person kind of thing, right?
2990830	3004062	C	0.6765998005867004	I think at times it's about kind of reading the other understanding the other guy's internal state is about sort of doing the right thing at the right time.
3004116	3015202	C	0.8715346455574036	Because I know there's a cue that tells me maybe if I do this stuff this could be really one way of getting surprising the system in a very positive way.
3015336	3018210	C	0.759165346622467	Okay, so I've just been pontificating.
3019030	3023154	C	0.6147083044052124	Zoe yes.
3023352	3023774	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3023832	3025858	E	0.5032982230186462	I think oh, gosh.
3025954	3027750	D	0.7924795746803284	Let me take my hand down.
3027820	3028294	D	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3028412	3028742	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3028796	3033986	E	0.8946852087974548	I think similar to what George said on sort of it's a bird song.
3034018	3037202	E	0.8444849848747253	I think there's different aspects know?
3037356	3037818	D	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3037904	3046038	E	0.8251194953918457	Generally on the technical, the physiology or the anatomy side, then the practitioner is always obviously more the expert.
3046134	3057758	E	0.7559401988983154	But I think there's certain things where maybe you're looking at a patient or you're still trying to examine them and the patient is still going to be the expert in their pain.
3057844	3071954	E	0.49834907054901123	And so you might be tossing and turning between a few diagnosis, say, and then the patient suddenly comes up with like, oh yeah, by the way, and then what you were thinking completely goes out.
3071992	3073960	E	0.7639025449752808	So I think you completely read them.
3074330	3087334	E	0.5409745573997498	There's always going to be sort of hidden states that you don't know about and then you're always on the lookout in case the situation is changing or maybe they don't want to tell you exactly what it is and you think something's missing.
3087382	3095846	E	0.8857693672180176	That intuition that maybe there's an element of this that you're not getting, or suddenly they got worse and you're wondering, well, what happened?
3095968	3097150	E	0.760477602481842	What changed?
3097970	3098926	E	0.7475712895393372	What goes on?
3098948	3100960	E	0.5563016533851624	And then you find out that.
3103330	3103694	D	0.5847998261451721	Their.
3103732	3114020	E	0.7758179903030396	Child'S been really sick or something, or their work has been really stressful or something else has happened, excluding that they haven't said that you kind of pick up on.
3115110	3121430	E	0.7259593605995178	So I think there's that where you're inferring what that other person means.
3121500	3135190	E	0.815544843673706	And there's definitely you're watching them, they're watching you, and you're kind of still deciding what's going to happen based on what you think is going on throughout treatment.
3135850	3157726	E	0.8587785959243774	There's no set treatment for certain things as well, whether it's exercises or touch, you have to adapt based on what you're feeling and similarly to what you ian that brought it up before, the sort of synchrony and whether it's exact or not.
3157828	3160366	E	0.7808947563171387	Well, it sort of also depends on the stimulus.
3160398	3183240	E	0.7859223484992981	There's a lot of research that there was one paper that was about a film and they got two separate people to watch the same film by themselves at separate times, but in certain parts of the film, their heart rate was exactly the same.
3184250	3190442	E	0.6663988828659058	Their heart rate went up when the fight scene happened and then their heart rate went down the same.
3190496	3199486	E	0.6707991361618042	And actually, you know, the difference was they were in sync even though they were nowhere near each other, couldn't see each other, didn't know what that person was doing.
3199508	3204190	E	0.7816788554191589	They're probably doing completely different things, but the stimulus dictated the synchrony.
3204930	3219010	E	0.8154256343841553	So I think that's an interesting thing to consider as well, that the synchrony might be from the stimulus that's happening during the treatment, whether it's touch, whether it's something else, but we focused on touch.
3219080	3230070	E	0.797735333442688	But yeah, whether you synchronize just based on what you're in that moment, but actually it's completely different otherwise.
3232010	3234140	E	0.7567910552024841	Yeah, just wanted to point that out.
3234990	3235740	A	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
3236190	3248462	A	0.8129602670669556	That reminds me a lot of this direct interfacing mechanism of synchrony, which might be via, like auditory communication, touch and so on.
3248516	3261186	A	0.4952531158924103	And then there's this more stigma, g based niche modification construction of a niche, like a corn maze where everybody walking through it is having a shared experience.
3261288	3264046	A	0.7632609009742737	Or like you said, with two people watching the same film.
3264158	3268062	A	0.6326941251754761	It's like there's some similarity in their niche.
3268206	3280786	A	0.7914823293685913	And so there's a resulting synchronization without direct interfacing because they're interacting in a shared there's something shared about their niche.
3280818	3295210	A	0.8584901690483093	Either two people going through the same niche at different moments, patients coming through a space, or there's people that are in separate physical spaces, but the niche has some similarity.
3296110	3299120	A	0.6984474658966064	And I'm sure there's a lot of other examples like that.
3299810	3300506	A	0.6129614114761353	Ian.
3300618	3305040	A	0.8842480182647705	And then I have that image up if you want to describe what you wanted to share there.
3305890	3306810	B	0.7800779342651367	Thanks, Daniel.
3306890	3308594	B	0.774163007736206	Yeah, I will describe that in a moment.
3308632	3318974	B	0.6759924292564392	But as conversation about films, I'm just thinking that Hollywood and filmmakers are actually masters of inducing synchrony.
3319022	3319474	B	0.6346455812454224	Really.
3319592	3324870	B	0.5112597942352295	They've got the birdsong, so they've got the beautiful music or the dramatic music or whatever.
3325020	3333710	B	0.6386284828186035	Got the imagery, the words, the composition of the images to hopefully not obviously not everyone will have the same experience of a film.
3333730	3343386	B	0.6360113024711609	But they hope that their sad film will induce some synchrony amongst the viewers in terms of the response in their body.
3343488	3355054	B	0.5514642000198364	Or a happy film will induce some kind of rhythmic and I'm thinking about some work I've heard.
3355092	3378710	B	0.5066744685173035	Of recently of John Viveki looking at emotional goosebumps and how this links to he thinks the process of temperature regulation is being exacted up into some kind of relevant or bringing things salient to us through goosebumps.
3380170	3388890	B	0.5353944301605225	And there's an opportunity there to kind of open up cognitively and explore some other ideas that maybe the person wasn't able to before.
3388960	3396894	B	0.7935779094696045	And you can think, okay, that music gave me goosebumps, and I had all these so, yeah, there's just a few things as we were talking there that I was thinking about.
3396932	3408250	B	0.8526840209960938	But this diagram was, George, as you were talking about, the kind of how the complex things that might be at play within a patient.
3408330	3412194	B	0.8676562309265137	This was done by MIT, only found out about it a few days ago.
3412232	3413666	B	0.8115192651748657	It was 2015.
3413848	3421074	B	0.8433130979537964	But all of these different factors that might lead someone into a kind of vicious cycle of depression.
3421122	3430966	B	0.6229479312896729	And we've got things like cortisol or unbridled inflammation at the top there.
3430988	3443158	B	0.5418362021446228	But then you've also got, as you said, George, the physical inactivity and how this you've got all these different looping perception action cycles here that are creating this sort of downward spiral.
3443254	3449658	B	0.799876868724823	And therapeutically, I guess what we're trying to do is create an upward opening, trying to get an access point.
3449744	3454666	B	0.6833693981170654	And Zoe, you said you might have to try lots of looking, trying one of these loops.
3454698	3467090	B	0.6969990134239197	And if that doesn't work, okay, try a different loop to open up this sort of thing that's tightening and maybe open it up either physically or perceptually.
3468630	3469234	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3469352	3470162	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3470296	3473910	A	0.8059489727020264	This is like very much showing that complex causation.
3474250	3488950	A	0.7714447379112244	And so sometimes a disciplinary approach might be like well, hippocampal volume is associated with this change and that could absolutely be empirically true or cytokine signaling or early adverse experiences.
3489110	3495370	A	0.5642571449279785	And so part of the challenge is reassembling this complex causal network.
3495810	3511070	A	0.7806020379066467	And then even if there were some sort of causal network that could be reassembled, then how might the failure mode be similar or different from the recovery mode?
3511150	3525522	A	0.5426295399665833	Like there are certain things that cannot be changed, like in the past and there's other things kind of like the concept of hysteresis where we can't just reversibly modify something.
3525656	3530210	A	0.8054724335670471	And so where are the leverage points in this diagram?
3530630	3534220	A	0.668505847454071	And it's yeah, George, it.
3537160	3543204	C	0.9209197163581848	Yeah, it's pretty complex, but yeah, very good diagram for sure.
3543242	3558970	C	0.7416911125183105	And I think there's a lot of stuff that we are talking about that's clearly there I think clearly we have modifiable and non modifiable things.
3560400	3567916	C	0.49439293146133423	There's stuff we can't change someone else's genetics, we can't change what happened in the past, okay?
3568098	3597220	C	0.6248323321342468	But they are modifiable things that at least in the context of musculoskeletal care are present that can include beliefs, their priors about their ideas about pain, what's wrong with them and so on down to things that could be lifestyle and lifestyle could be more movement, kind of changing the diet or whatever.
3597370	3605960	C	0.607816755771637	Stop smoking, kind of engaging in something that starts getting them kind of start getting their sense making back.
3606030	3606650	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3608700	3610776	C	0.748388409614563	Through the sense, the ideas.
3610808	3618300	C	0.7686806917190552	And actually the other interesting thing about this stuff where are the opportunities?
3620800	3624610	C	0.8779168725013733	How can we start that process of change?
3625300	3638180	C	0.798175036907196	A very nice model, typically aligned more with an activist approach now sort of finding ways into pain and so on, are the ecological psychology ideas about affordances.
3639960	3642580	C	0.7979332804679871	What is out there in the environment?
3643080	3648776	C	0.8948600888252258	Already linked some authors to kind of the active inference, predictive processing and so on.
3648878	3676704	C	0.8619709014892578	But clearly one can think about the world provides us with a landscape of affordances stuff that kind of are opportunities for action, which is basically what the description of an affordance is and one that lives in a very nice environment, for example, with a beautiful park and can walk along the coastline and stress free environment and so on.
3676742	3683728	C	0.6372178792953491	Clearly that world, it's a world for the sort of beautiful kind of lifestyle and so on, right?
3683814	3693696	C	0.5622997283935547	Whereas if one lives in an urban jungle and everybody's super stressed outside and so on, arguably that landscape kind of is much smaller.
3693728	3702264	C	0.7177817225456238	And when we say, yeah, would be good for you to start walking, for example, that would be a good way of start managing your back pain.
3702382	3706324	C	0.5336061120033264	The patient can say, yeah, but when I get out of the house, I'm struggling.
3706372	3710188	C	0.8824357390403748	I might just get run over by a car straight away.
3710354	3712648	C	0.9696336388587952	The environment outside is awful.
3712744	3714296	C	0.921423077583313	There's pollution everywhere.
3714488	3716030	C	0.8261153101921082	What do you want me to do?
3718400	3719948	C	0.8738378882408142	I'm scared of going outside.
3720034	3721804	C	0.7538601160049438	So, no, thank you very much.
3721922	3733520	C	0.6194496154785156	But of course, if you are on the other side of the spectrum, you can invite the person and use what's out there and start playing a little bit with those opportunities for action.
3734900	3747268	C	0.8006093502044678	I think those are tools that if we think sometimes we can start thinking very hard about what sort of exercises should the patient do, should the person get engaged and so on.
3747434	3765388	C	0.547087550163269	And if we think much in much simpler terms and think about what's outside, what's out there, what kind of things are already in the environment that can be used to actually promote change, we would be surprised that actually just a flight of stairs would be good enough.
3765474	3766440	C	0.5301789045333862	Don't take the lift.
3766520	3774320	C	0.9007859826087952	Take the stairs and start sort of walking a little bit back and forth from home to work and so on.
3774390	3779664	C	0.6536110043525696	Those minimal things, if the person feels like, yeah, okay, I'll have a go, and I'll try that.
3779862	3790244	C	0.8981260657310486	Clearly we are in that process of kind of changing a little bit of their sort of internal state.
3790442	3796672	C	0.9084007740020752	Maybe that prior about, yeah, I can't move, I can't lift, because it will damage my back.
3796746	3802410	C	0.5376633405685425	In fact, when they start trusting their bodies, they can do a little bit more.
3804780	3807992	C	0.5832675695419312	It's always hard to think about, okay, how can I change this?
3808046	3811020	C	0.8395470380783081	How can I change the generative model?
3811090	3819384	C	0.5077303647994995	And we almost think everything needs to be conscious, cognitive and so on, when in fact, a lot of stuff happens unconsciously.
3819432	3820030	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3822080	3829756	C	0.4968595504760742	If it was always about, I'm going to think about changing and I'm going to do this, then the world would be much simpler.
3829788	3829984	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3830022	3836470	C	0.4939168095588684	But a lot of stuff is hidden anyway, and even the person is not aware of that stuff.
3838760	3848804	C	0.687355101108551	So the change, the process, the tools and so on, that goes back to that very good diagram with all these factors.
3848852	3851416	C	0.6814624071121216	And I think as a practitioner, yes, okay.
3851518	3868572	C	0.59604811668396	I can focus entirely on the brain and the neuroscience of it and become like a brain centric approach, or I can start thinking about actually the brain is it's the hardware kind of stuff, but there's much more in it and much more in it.
3868706	3872784	C	0.8032078742980957	Takes the person, takes the environment, takes the kind of opportunities and so on.
3872822	3875010	C	0.680038332939148	The stuff out there can be used.
3876100	3877100	A	0.8561402559280396	Thank you, George.
3877180	3878000	A	0.7534393072128296	Zoe?
3880580	3880992	D	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3881046	3897552	E	0.727264404296875	Just going off of what George said in terms of the environment around it, like when you're sort of maybe if you're surrounded by nature or things like that, then you might be sort of more willing or more able to change your priors.
3897616	3903412	E	0.60927814245224	I think it's also important to realize, especially through touch, that it's one modality.
3903476	3903704	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3903742	3920716	E	0.861168622970581	It's one way in which we're starting to kind of try to understand and try to manipulate the process of sort of changing those memories, whether it's the way it's processed or just having initially or just trying to adapt it.
3920738	3923760	E	0.6975297331809998	And that's that touch is one way.
3923830	3938400	E	0.5903507471084595	But I think also it's interesting that it's probably more likely that we may not be able to completely change that sort of prior, but we might in that context.
3938560	3953444	E	0.5498606562614441	So we might not change the fact that it's painful to bend down, but we might be able to, through touch and through sort of treatment, get the patient to realize, okay, well, yes, maybe bending forwards is dangerous.
3953492	3955160	E	0.9148039817810059	It is a bad thing.
3955310	3962028	E	0.6395647525787354	But if you do it in a certain way and you look at it in this way, then actually it's not so bad.
3962194	3968156	E	0.8006672859191895	So I think it's important to take the context into it.
3968178	3984432	E	0.7163614630699158	I think with this, I think we might be able to maybe not completely change the maladaptive belief, but with touch we can try to change it so that it's more context specific rather than a general belief that isn't able to change.
3984486	3985636	E	0.6028034687042236	We might be able to change it.
3985658	3997830	E	0.8707112669944763	So in certain circumstances, whether it's the way we do things or just the way that we approach things, we might be able to update it or modify it for that specific thing.
3999400	4004068	E	0.6195561289787292	I know that papers were talking about it in terms of like being scared of spiders.
4004244	4017116	E	0.5441452860832214	You might still be scared of spiders, but if you know that you're scared of spiders and they've got food nearby and the spider is happy, then maybe, yeah, the spider is still scary, but it's not likely to kill you or something like that.
4017138	4023232	E	0.6194763779640198	In this circumstance, it's not as bad as it could be and you're going to be safe from whatever sort of fear it is.
4023286	4030396	E	0.5118829607963562	So I think that's an important thing to add on from what George was saying, and I'll pass it back to George.
4030588	4031404	A	0.5850776433944702	Yes, George.
4031452	4032210	A	0.5901033282279968	And then.
4035640	4038550	C	0.8004166483879089	Know what Zoe just said.
4040760	4042068	C	0.7024755477905273	It's quite important.
4042154	4049930	C	0.6214029788970947	And through touch we can clearly get in kind of affect, understand and so on.
4050620	4054730	C	0.930950939655304	I think that's all the positive stuff about touch.
4055180	4068060	C	0.8736880421638489	There's another factor, another side of the equation which I think as practitioners we need to be aware of, which is the power of what's the hidden state and that touch can trigger.
4068560	4074188	C	0.5152332782745361	And particularly in trauma situations, memories are embodied.
4074284	4082608	C	0.7546452283859253	And when you touch someone in a particular part of the body, that might again bring that unconscious stuff about.
4082694	4099704	C	0.8431667685508728	For example, someone has been victim of sexual abuse for example and you could touch a person and straight away either there is a sort of a massive response fight or flight what's going on here?
4099902	4112264	C	0.6134709715843201	Or if it is about this sort of hidden state you might actually find that that touch kind of created a response that is almost like a no go zone.
4112312	4117528	C	0.5801868438720703	And you kind of need to be aware that sometimes you touch people that don't like being touched.
4117704	4129170	C	0.5886902213096619	Someone goes to a clinician that in an intervention is primarily touch based, doesn't like being touched, it might go well, it might synchronize extremely well.
4129620	4132496	C	0.5019446611404419	They understand you, they talk when you start, say, okay, let's have a look.
4132518	4137776	C	0.8106905221939087	Let's palpate that you can feel like there's a fight or flight kind of mode.
4137808	4139572	C	0.7610407471656799	The person goes in straight away.
4139706	4157032	C	0.7000451683998108	So I think understanding this is also quite important in understanding the limits of competence of someone in Musculoskeletal care, for example, that that's an area that where probably the person needs to be referred to someone else, an expert in the area.
4157166	4162444	C	0.8566019535064697	Maybe by getting a sense of there's a response here.
4162482	4168828	C	0.5497050285339355	That's not the one I would expect to perhaps not then to open the Pandora box.
4168994	4182112	C	0.5559774041175842	Oh, tell me a little bit about what's going on here because again, you pressed on a button that keep the lid on kind of thing.
4182166	4183650	C	0.6841921806335449	Don't open it, please.
4185080	4187940	C	0.7280460596084595	This is important, I think, both ways.
4188090	4200936	C	0.7529715299606323	It's kind of the power as a therapeutic tool, but also the power of triggering responses that actually are quite important to take into account.
4201038	4222324	C	0.7065714001655579	And in fact, the paper we got accepted yesterday, which is the continuation of this in musculoskeletal care, one of the reviewers actually wanted us to say there are psychologists, psychotherapy treat people, that memories are embodied and you need to be aware of avoiding overlaps.
4222392	4222960	C	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
4223110	4237888	C	0.6931467056274414	So that means don't jump into an area that you don't know about, but be aware that sometimes you're getting that response pretty much you're getting into someone hidden state stuff that is there in the background.
4238064	4239812	C	0.4819808006286621	Just leave it alone, please.
4239946	4253290	C	0.6913797855377197	That's the way at least I see the world around me is like don't sort of start the process that you don't want to or if you don't, if you do, then go and see someone.
4256940	4257924	A	0.5257456302642822	Or sorry, Ian.
4257972	4258920	A	0.6333546042442322	And then blue.
4263180	4263896	B	0.6681271195411682	Oh, it's okay.
4263918	4264904	B	0.5434662699699402	I didn't have my hand up.
4264942	4266052	B	0.7214006185531616	So over to blue.
4266196	4267790	A	0.5754895806312561	OK, blue, go for it.
4268800	4282608	F	0.8569236397743225	So it's interesting, and I don't know if in your work as an osteopath, but there's many layers I found through working emotionally, physically on myself through my life.
4282694	4284368	F	0.7555767297744751	It's like peeling an onion, right?
4284454	4294404	F	0.5549888610839844	And so as you go through, it's interesting that all this stuff resurfaces and even physical trauma remains there.
4294442	4295776	F	0.5349176526069641	Like you stub your pinky toe.
4295808	4300548	F	0.547004759311676	You stub your pinky toe 25 times, 35 times, 255 times, who knows how many times, right?
4300554	4302072	F	0.643532395362854	It depends on how clumsy you are.
4302206	4304840	F	0.6135414838790894	But your pinky toe remembers being stubbed.
4305180	4313390	F	0.5318053364753723	It has maybe like a hyper response because it's been stubbed so many times, because it's whatever that's its little job in life is to be stubbed, I think.
4314320	4322716	F	0.6310785412788391	But it's interesting that you kind of have to open it up to do the work.
4322818	4326688	F	0.8253452777862549	And I wonder what kind of synchronous work there is.
4326854	4339232	F	0.6508961915969849	I know that there are some people that deal with physical and emotional trauma and I know physical trauma can be a manifestation of emotional trauma and you can have emotional trauma based on your physical trauma.
4339296	4355412	F	0.659270167350769	So again, it's like this bi directional circular loop and I wonder what the training is in osteopathy to deal with emotional trauma that may come up or what kind of are there people that do integrative practices?
4355476	4361320	F	0.8394197821617126	Like you have to be an osteopath and then maybe you do your residency as a psychiatrist?
4363360	4369820	F	0.5122160911560059	Can you get it all out if you have some kind of linked problem that's both physical and emotional?
4371520	4373192	A	0.8561402559280396	Thank you, George.
4373256	4374220	A	0.7184714078903198	Then Ian.
4375380	4406008	C	0.8494707942008972	Okay, so the model in terms of therapeutic alliance and synchrony and using touch if we use to the whole world of healthcare practice could argue that in a world of psychotherapy for example mind body kind of stuff the person would be sort of equipped with the tools to explore, to enable them to open up, to start the process.
4406174	4417672	C	0.8305851221084595	And being able to deal with that the paper as a kind of a generic kind of model that could apply as an umbrella to a number of areas of practice.
4417816	4420172	C	0.8084177374839783	For sure, we can do that and no problem.
4420306	4431676	C	0.7712420225143433	If we think specifically about manual therapy and specifically about osteopathy, then you've got two worlds, the American world of osteopathic medicine, where osteopathic medicine is medicine.
4431788	4440036	C	0.79609215259552	And there are osteopaths in the US who are psychiatrists as well.
4440138	4463368	C	0.7292715311050415	And in that case, yes, that person would be ideally suited to be able to explore that, to do that, to kind of start that process of care, actually using both their competences as a psychiatrist and their competences as also manual therapist as a hands on kind of a practitioner.
4463544	4474544	C	0.6466647982597351	In other countries, osteopaths are primarily kind of manual therapists, if you want to call it that way.
4474582	4483612	C	0.5936737060546875	Although osteopaths don't like being called manual therapists, but primarily use manual therapy primarily in musculoskeletal care, but other areas of practice.
4483756	4495104	C	0.8861178159713745	And we start seeing a number of practitioners going down the route of like physiotherapists using what is called a psychologically informed type of practice.
4495232	4505252	C	0.9294700026512146	And that typically involves some additional training in counseling or some additional training in some CBT like kind of approaches.
4505316	4511916	C	0.8283496499061584	Like, for example, something like acceptance and commitment therapy, for example.
4512018	4523636	C	0.5818496346473694	So stuff that actually combined with hands on potentiates the effect of the treatment that the hands on alone would not achieve.
4523688	4535520	C	0.6166409850120544	But when you come from the two kind of two different angles meeting in the middle and providing a more robust package of care you can get better results.
4535960	4559412	C	0.7917526960372925	Because the training as a preregistration level is very basic to enable you to recognize that there are things that need a referral to another practitioner even those that practice a psychologically informed type of practice.
4559476	4571884	C	0.5093398094177246	Like several physiotherapists have developed a kind of a traffic light system where clearly there are stuff on the yellow that anxiety is associated with pain and so on.
4571922	4574044	C	0.5072960257530212	That's okay, you can deal with that.
4574162	4580444	C	0.7264713048934937	There's some stuff kind of in the orange that you have to be a little bit careful.
4580492	4589308	C	0.5108022689819336	And there are clearly stuff PTSDs and so on, where it's a no go zone because you can dive in.
4589334	4592868	C	0.5243522524833679	And then you don't know if you're going to come back okay kind of thing.
4593034	4596288	C	0.9135563373565674	So that is typically a referral to another practitioner.
4596384	4610520	C	0.8781811594963074	Having said that, I think there are opportunities for collaborative work where the two together can actually provide a much better service to a person that's simply relying on one practitioner that can do everything.
4610590	4628640	C	0.5758055448532104	I think that sometimes exploring stuff through the physical body, the embodied self opens the doors for stuff to be explored at other elements of the self when the body is a little bit more prepared to deal with stuff and people maybe are prepared to talk.
4628790	4634210	C	0.6344361901283264	Sometimes you see that in cases of childhood abuse and so on.
4634900	4645136	C	0.9437234997749329	Kind of had some stuff that felt good, some hands on work, even the massage and the person felt a bit more confident in themselves and they were prepared then let's have a chat.
4645248	4654072	C	0.671954333782196	And they were not prepared to sort of go to talking therapy straight away because there was too much going on in there.
4654126	4655610	C	0.7119361162185669	Kind of invited itself.
4657340	4660730	A	0.6563727855682373	The sirens go off when certain things happen.
4661520	4662270	C	0.5662814974784851	Exactly.
4662720	4663580	A	0.6129614114761353	Ian.
4666320	4666732	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4666786	4701016	B	0.7977283596992493	So just sort of picking up on the points from George and the question from yeah really totally agree that it's not the job of an untrained manual therapist to kind of aim to open a can of worms of something that especially if it's not five minutes before the end of a session, and then you kind of say, okay, I want to see you later, see you next week, and got another client now, and that's definitely not a good idea.
4701198	4708330	B	0.8136312961578369	However, as you said, George, sometimes people will come and they'll want to offer things and they'll want to talk about stuff.
4710380	4716520	B	0.8903796076774597	And what I was thinking about Blue as you were asking about sort of the different combinations of approaches.
4716600	4726380	B	0.7384917736053467	I don't know if George and Zoe or any of you are familiar with David Bocelli's work on tre trauma release or tension release.
4729360	4731776	B	0.7425790429115295	You know, he doesn't really go into the story.
4731878	4737492	B	0.6164117455482483	So it's not kind of psychoanalytical or unraveling the stories of people's past.
4737546	4745936	B	0.8993287682533264	But he has methods for inducing kind of what I think is myofascial and what it looks like myofascial unwinding.
4745968	4777810	B	0.7508073449134827	So sometimes it's tremoring and so it's sort of I don't think he necessarily uses touch in the beginning, but I guess what I'm thinking is that there are ways that if the ways of offering clients opportunities to unravel the bodily trapped or the stuff that's held in the body where they don't have to verbalize it if they don't want to.
4778180	4788656	B	0.876960039138794	But the inroad is to induce some kind of letting go, which maybe is what all manual therapy is about, to a greater or lesser degree.
4788688	4791296	B	0.49788445234298706	But his examples are quite dramatic.
4791408	4798564	B	0.6340498924255371	People will be making big movements that seemingly are uncontrolled but if you ask them to stop at any time, they can stop.
4798682	4800260	B	0.8192024230957031	They can bring it into voluntary.
4800340	4805770	B	0.5473421216011047	But there seems to be a really big updating of some generative model through this process.
4809020	4811240	B	0.7205861806869507	Yeah, they're my thoughts.
4812560	4813550	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
4814640	4819240	A	0.8697540163993835	I'm going to return to our previous complex causation network.
4819320	4834844	A	0.7507926225662231	Now, it's smaller because we're abstracting away from the details and think about, like, what are some active inference questions that come to mind and how could we look at this differently than, for example, just a structural equation model that's fit from many empirical studies?
4834972	4838592	A	0.910422146320343	And so here's Figure 4.3 from the textbook.
4838736	4842996	A	0.875018298625946	And this is a partially observable Markov decision process.
4843178	4848432	A	0.851368248462677	And it's come up in other papers and live streams, so we won't go into too much details.
4848576	4857416	A	0.8786951303482056	But the kinds of things that we might want to ask are, like, what variables are latent states or observable in general?
4857518	4867064	A	0.5221683979034424	And then in the specific case, for example, maybe there's a total, absolutely perfect association between hippocampus volume and some other clinical outcome.
4867192	4870792	A	0.7573710680007935	And so hippocampus volume conceptually is observable.
4870856	4872168	A	0.7882710695266724	It could be observed.
4872264	4878050	A	0.4919062554836273	But in that exact patient's case, it may not be an observable in that relationship.
4878580	4884396	A	0.8496494889259338	So variables can be observable in one context and latent in another context.
4884508	4895444	A	0.7470044493675232	So that might speak to evidence based grounding where like, okay, we don't know what somebody's blood level of this is, what's the most informative thing to do?
4895562	4897348	A	0.8465325832366943	Maybe we can measure it.
4897434	4901716	A	0.7949312925338745	And then that ties their measurements into other observables.
4901748	4902760	A	0.7649787664413452	So that's one question.
4902830	4905880	A	0.8623487949371338	What are observables and what are latent variables?
4906460	4909624	A	0.8599241375923157	What variables do we have causal influence on?
4909742	4916828	A	0.9060791730880737	What affordances exist that might have intervening influence on some unobserved state?
4916914	4923470	A	0.8161329030990601	So here's, like, pi the policy selection and then the way that the hidden state is changing through time.
4924240	4926480	A	0.7992718815803528	That's what the affordances are about.
4926550	4930048	A	0.7422206401824951	Influencing the hidden state is the true temperature of the room.
4930134	4932528	A	0.7723749279975891	The thermometer is the observed value.
4932694	4942884	A	0.8689064383506775	And then taking an action like turning on the air conditioning is about intervening in the hidden state such that other observables are seen.
4943082	4949384	A	0.901501476764679	And then we talked also about like, in what ways can we change the generative model?
4949502	4953400	A	0.81651771068573	So here's the policy selection of the practitioner.
4953980	4961080	A	0.8623837232589722	And then in the interface, it's like, it's meeting with the observations of the patient.
4961660	4967160	A	0.8734890222549438	The actions of the practitioner, what they say and what they do are received as observations.
4967240	4970732	A	0.7973464131355286	And that's kind of this dyad active that we've seen.
4970786	4990884	A	0.8413100838661194	So rather than the one entity navigating and sense making in the world, the joint sense making features, this interface where the policy selections on one and their thinking through other minds, their inference on the generative model of the other is what is being intervened in.
4991082	4994784	A	0.8046095371246338	How can we change the generative model, the cognitive models?
4994912	4996950	A	0.8045979738235474	How can we change the generative process?
4997320	5011480	A	0.6283750534057617	Could there be something welcoming on the door of the room that is a modification of the niche or some other design choice that helps scaffold this therapeutic niche?
5012080	5026370	A	0.8879075050354004	And yeah, what policies can be taken from the toolkit that is afforded in that moment based upon the training and the equipment available and so on, that influence what to result in what.
5027460	5031730	A	0.8013274073600769	And that kind of comes back to this synchrony for what question?
5032420	5054948	A	0.6900334358215332	Just achieving synchrony is like a sort of undirected hypnosis or undirected sort of I don't know, it's just sort of like this vegetative propagation of coordination that would only coincidentally be functional.
5055124	5063196	A	0.745058536529541	So having a functional outcome in mind, then there can be a working backwards, like well, what observations are we looking for?
5063378	5066472	A	0.8422905206680298	And then what hidden states give rise to those observations?
5066616	5076620	A	0.889262318611145	And what policies exist that intervene in those hidden states and in the dynamics of how they change, recognizing their complexity?
5076780	5087060	A	0.8892793655395508	So those would just be a few active inference variables and approaches that are being invoked here conversationally.
5088040	5096950	A	0.8797445297241211	However, the kinds of models and the empirical data to take it further are being sketched out.
5100060	5105140	A	0.795238196849823	Well, it's going very fast and we're in kind of the home stretch.
5105220	5110170	A	0.9188718199729919	So what would anyone like to look at or turn to?
5110700	5119710	A	0.7935087084770203	We have a few other questions that previously had been raised that we didn't perhaps get to.
5120080	5126764	A	0.7964675426483154	Some of them are written here, so anything that people see here that they're interested in or any other topic.
5126892	5131244	A	0.732266902923584	And then also just how are we coming out of this dot?
5131292	5139712	A	0.8084526062011719	Two what will be different in our action as we are engaged in this area, of course, from many different perspectives.
5139776	5140580	A	0.6141266822814941	George.
5143800	5150888	C	0.9551706910133362	I loved your kind of proposal, your summary of all those active inference questions.
5150974	5154330	C	0.8614656329154968	In fact, there's a structure for paper in it, right?
5157260	5161870	C	0.8100312352180481	It can take us down the road, even just sort of looking at some computational stuff.
5162560	5166060	C	0.8044337034225464	So creating some kind of a framework.
5167200	5170430	C	0.9251572489738464	Yeah, so I very much like it.
5171520	5181056	C	0.8097248673439026	I think there is a sort of challenge and what are the latents and observables and so on to define those kind of things?
5181078	5182770	C	0.7235536575317383	That needs a little bit of thinking.
5185460	5194550	C	0.5013559460639954	The other stuff, I think, as you said, probably working backwards would sort of becomes easier, isn't it?
5195560	5201156	C	0.7958449125289917	It is about hands on with reassurance and so on.
5201258	5210884	C	0.7874051332473755	If that's sort of what the policy and so on and what we observed back at the beginning, I think it would be fascinating.
5210932	5225090	C	0.8306258916854858	I think in terms of the bio behavioral kind of element of synchrony, there's clearly changes in breathing, changes in probably heart rate variability and so on.
5226900	5230256	C	0.6139861345291138	That would be interesting to understand.
5230438	5237650	C	0.8718766570091248	Is that a sign that the system is sort of starting, changing the process?
5238660	5243670	C	0.8785681128501892	It talked about the thing, maybe something in the door of the room.
5245080	5256472	C	0.7151753902435303	A couple of years ago when I was practicing in another country for quite a few months, I used to use a lot of classical music and opera and so on.
5256606	5267340	C	0.8045825362205505	And that was actually a tremendously effective way of creating an environment where the person sort of actually a form of inducing that synchrony.
5269280	5271324	C	0.8332135081291199	I'm treating I'm kind of doing this stuff.
5271362	5272572	C	0.4938734173774719	I don't need to talk that much.
5272626	5276544	C	0.7511358857154846	I'm kind of just go with the sensations, go with the music.
5276662	5282850	C	0.9475257992744446	And I felt that actually that was a very good way as a process of start changing the generative model.
5284820	5294580	C	0.8521990180015564	So there is the stuff, as we kind of proposed on one of the recent papers, the stuff that you can implement.
5295160	5309144	C	0.7717896103858948	So if you doing the Tactile, the touch based intervention and use forms of language sometimes to get the person to visualize what you're doing, for example, I'm doing this and I'm trying to achieve that.
5309182	5323244	C	0.6512579917907715	And you know that the person is even, like, interceptively robust enough to let you explore the inner sensations to situations as you're probably doing some work.
5323282	5337552	C	0.7920717000961304	And you realize by sort of predicting their internal states that they're just focusing too much and giving too much attention to stuff which is actually not useful, where you can just say, oh, you know what?
5337686	5341060	C	0.5172939300537109	Like we said in the paper, I have a new dog.
5341210	5343844	C	0.7949960231781006	And where does the dog come from?
5343962	5361332	C	0.8387730717658997	But a dog in that sense is a way of sort of breaking down that attention to what you're doing to sort of say oh, okay, so you're continuing, there's still the sensory stimulation, there is still that sensory evidence arriving to the system.
5361406	5376752	C	0.7429918050765991	But actually you start changing a little bit, you're flattening a little bit of the sensory state by sort of zeroing things and then maybe those sensations that come in potentially kind of change some stuff.
5376806	5382976	C	0.6789399981498718	So yeah, I think at this level that's for sure some stuff to do.
5383078	5408564	C	0.9394737482070923	I think it's an interesting thing that actually started being explored now with Ted Kapchuk lab in Harvard around Acupuncture, which know looking at synchrony as well with hyperscanning techniques and kind of finding that actually successful in terms of the intervention is associated again, what synchrony.
5408692	5415870	C	0.9618327617645264	So kind of a body of evidence sort of building up, I think quite nice.
5419200	5430636	A	0.8611874580383301	One thought on the free energy minimizing and ML Don and several others were discussing in the chat about our biological systems truly finding global minima.
5430668	5453992	A	0.7644251585006714	And so it's a big question, but just to give one thought on it is the free energy is calculated for a given policy sequence of actions in terms of how informative that sequence of actions is expected to be and how useful that sequence of action is supposed to be expected to be.
5454126	5464604	A	0.8799893856048584	And so different action pathways are evaluated based upon their ability to reduce uncertainty or provide direct value.
5464802	5486996	A	0.5163597464561462	And so if we can just maybe there's multiple things that have value in the therapeutic alliance, but one for the generative model of the practitioner might be like to reduce a number on a pain survey that would be useful and then there might be multiple policies and maybe adequacy is good enough.
5487178	5508372	A	0.525870680809021	And if the pathways are to some balance or shifting balance of informative and useful, either reducing pain or helping understand how to reduce pain, then navigating and shifting policies is something that can be done adaptively.
5508436	5519630	A	0.8265649080276489	And then in contrast, the policies that might want to be disfavored would be like the ones that are adding confusion, reducing clarity of sense making or increasing pain.
5520560	5542784	A	0.6308201551437378	And that's not to say that there's not moments where transiently surprise does increase or pain does increase, but that is part of a policy like, I'm going to touch this place, that might transiently increase pain, but that might be an informative action that in an extended timeline is part of a free energy minimizing trajectory.
5542912	5546244	A	0.811129093170166	And so what is the horizon and so on.
5546362	5548390	A	0.83341383934021	George and then anyone else?
5552140	5556260	C	0.7458311915397644	That thing sort of modifying pain, modifying symptoms.
5556420	5563980	C	0.8038426637649536	It's quite an interesting thing because for example, at least in my profession, there's this idea that we don't treat the symptoms, we treat the cause of the problem.
5564050	5568110	C	0.47900649905204773	Okay, so pain is just the symptoms, nothing to worry about.
5570080	5578032	C	0.7984718680381775	But from this perspective, actually changing symptoms, reducing symptoms is actually an important thing, quite an important thing.
5578086	5581324	C	0.685236394405365	Particularly if you're thinking about chronic conditions.
5581372	5590070	C	0.6219162344932556	If you start making the person start feeling a little bit better, then you probably start changing the whole process.
5590680	5596132	C	0.5075557827949524	If you don't change anything, how is the person going to engage in that?
5596186	5606696	C	0.7697347402572632	If actually you can continue saying you're moving much better, your function is so much better, but actually the person says, you know what, but pine hasn't reduced at all.
5606718	5607880	C	0.8354834318161011	I'm still in agony.
5608460	5617150	C	0.6592596173286438	I think going a little bit with small things at that level are quite important in the greater scheme of things in terms of changing the generative model.
5618400	5625036	C	0.7839043140411377	So it is clearly a fundamental bit of the jigsaw.
5625148	5636432	C	0.6305181384086609	And it's the same as you said, informing, for example, this might be uncomfortable, but in fact is important in kind of achieving something.
5636566	5642740	C	0.5248908400535583	So the same way some patients tell you it is painful, but it's a good pain.
5642890	5650890	C	0.5670786499977112	So again, what's the value of the good pain is, the reward is a sort of anticipation that this will lead to a positive change.
5652220	5652840	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
5652910	5653720	A	0.7534393072128296	Zoe?
5657260	5663032	E	0.870051383972168	Yeah, I think George just kind of touched upon what I was going to know.
5663086	5668872	E	0.8141148686408997	Sometimes patients I know, I have patients that come to a session and they expect it to be painful.
5669016	5682736	E	0.5881243944168091	I mean, a lot of people expect that at some point they might get that sort of, quote, good pain where they almost want to feel like something's happening.
5682838	5689328	E	0.6503289937973022	And whether that feedback is kind of pain or something, that's kind of reassuring.
5689424	5700468	E	0.6981530785560608	I know patients, especially with sort of osteopathic, manipulative sort of treatment, they want the click.
5700634	5705688	E	0.591437816619873	If someone manipulates them, they come in and go, oh, I just want you to click me.
5705854	5713870	E	0.8293089270591736	And, you know, the research shows that not necessarily you need that sound, but that feedback that they sort of want.
5714320	5730210	E	0.5810181498527527	They kind of want some people, they expect if you do a hard, sort of a more firm massage, they feel like they're, I don't know, getting their money's worth or they're getting more sort of treatment than if they want.
5730980	5737044	E	0.6075059175491333	They kind of want that feedback to say, yeah, you're in the right place, and I get that a lot.
5737082	5739876	E	0.7048625946044922	So I think pain is an interesting one.
5739898	5756824	E	0.8696882724761963	I think the biosynchrony that we get and we go upon, whether it is the patient's heart rate, their breathing changes, you see their facial expression changes or the muscle tightens up nearby, you kind of go on that.
5757022	5760852	E	0.545621395111084	And I think it's what they expect to get from treatment.
5760916	5765500	E	0.6081259846687317	Not every patient is going to come in and go, yeah, I want to be in less pain.
5765570	5768056	E	0.5212439894676208	That might not be their ultimate goal.
5768088	5781584	E	0.7173655033111572	Obviously they're not going to say no to it, but they might really just want to be able to pick their kid up or go to sleep with just being able to go to sleep, not being in pain or not waking up or something like that.
5781622	5790032	E	0.7647705078125	So I think it's not yes, we can clinically, it's not so simple as something that we can measure imperatively.
5790096	5806024	E	0.6606820225715637	It might be something that a goal to that patient is more important than if their pain is less or if they're moving better or oh, well, yeah, if we had the technology to say, look.
5806062	5806824	E	0.6038892269134521	Oh, look, your heart.
5806862	5807640	E	0.7903999090194702	Rate is lower.
5807710	5809796	E	0.5546956062316895	Or this means that you're more efficient.
5809908	5814428	E	0.534313976764679	You're saving free energy because you're not expending on your pain.
5814514	5818956	E	0.6043492555618286	Or you're more efficient, so you'll have more energy to do this.
5818978	5821900	E	0.4888875186443329	Now that you're doing this better, they may not care.
5822050	5826608	E	0.5254518985748291	They may just want to be able to pick their kid up and not be in pain.
5826774	5839176	E	0.5437564253807068	So I think what we're measuring, I think, will be very individual to the patient and it might not be something that is necessarily useful in terms of research that we can quantify.
5839308	5843940	E	0.5956212878227234	It just might be that goal that's not always sort of empirical.
5845560	5846768	A	0.9192813634872437	Thank you, Zoe.
5846944	5847780	E	0.6129614114761353	Ian.
5851980	5852824	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
5853022	5853832	B	0.8129556179046631	Thanks, all.
5853886	5862412	B	0.7369911670684814	And, yeah, just as you were saying that, Zoe, you said at the beginning, I think the intention behind it all is to help them.
5862546	5871116	B	0.6956291794776917	And I'm just thinking of a scenario or some scenarios of when agreeing on the goals is so important.
5871218	5874044	B	0.8460965156555176	So I'm thinking short term goals and long term goals here.
5874082	5891268	B	0.6873897910118103	So clients who are maybe endurance runners, and they want to do six ultramarathons a year and they come to you because their calves are hurting, so your immediate goal is to reduce the pain in their calves so they can make the ultramarathon at the end of the month.
5891434	5913780	B	0.6316708326339722	But then if I'm aware as a therapist that there's a link between endurance running and developing arrhythmias, heart arrhythmias, for example, and I see this person is very anxious about their goals to the point where it's almost like they need it rather than it's a pleasure.
5913940	5920844	B	0.6406359076499939	As such, then if I disagree with their goal, are we am I true?
5920882	5925392	B	0.8126950263977051	You know, and saying, actually, maybe four ultramarathons a year would be enough for you.
5925526	5932720	B	0.7262163758277893	Am I just enabling this drive by relieving your calf pain in the short term?
5933060	5949380	B	0.7320802211761475	So I think agreeing on those more broader life goals or referring to someone else if I don't agree with that, that's more of an ethical issue.
5949530	5951850	B	0.8132488131523132	But it came to mind as we were talking there.
5952460	5974610	A	0.9189872741699219	Yeah, that reminds me of the kind of performances that we might see in the Olympics or the medical care that might happen on the sideline of a game where somebody has been injured, but they're going to continue doing it almost in a way that is rapidly degrading potentially the future weeks of their health.
5974980	5979484	A	0.7678757309913635	And then that's the ethical challenge or the decision making challenge.
5979532	5986496	A	0.6484771966934204	Like is it worth them to hobble across the finish line with an injury?
5986528	5999432	A	0.4919404089450836	That every step is just deteriorating the injury, but then being consistent with a belief that one is a finisher or even a signal to those who are watching.
5999486	6003290	A	0.7734339237213135	There's so many complex phenomena at that level.
6004460	6008090	A	0.8486996293067932	Those are very interesting questions.
6009660	6010264	A	0.7093686461448669	Wow.
6010382	6019640	A	0.7841475605964661	So we're towards the end here, I guess for the authors and for anyone else, we can give some of our last thoughts.
6019720	6026930	A	0.8910861015319824	What are some of your next directions for this line of research and application?
6031380	6045072	C	0.9652470946311951	Okay, well, first of all, as last time was a fascinating discussion, think kind of learning a lot from this kind of interaction.
6045216	6046070	C	0.5574129819869995	For sure.
6048200	6057848	C	0.8150361776351929	Within this we sort of got some stuff done published in the musculoskeletal side of things.
6057934	6066200	C	0.812272310256958	We have another paper to be submitted very soon, the next week or so, the same topic, but in pediatrics.
6066280	6068910	C	0.7877625226974487	And there's the bulk of the other stuff building up.
6069440	6096100	C	0.8417593240737915	I think what we want to achieve now is to start testing some of these ideas kind of empirically using different methods from qualitative kind of phenomenological type of approaches, trying to understand really what's going on to more sort of NeuroBio stuff.
6096250	6114940	C	0.9220705628395081	Kind of along the lines of looking at for example, some markers of bio behavioral synchrony like for example, physiological changes in both the practitioner and the patient.
6115280	6117470	C	0.7634152770042419	Bearing in mind some of this stuff.
6119120	6132320	C	0.5332527756690979	It is a bit more challenging to achieve because whereas for example, in the field of psychotherapy, the person practitioner is typically sitting down, the guy doing manual therapy is moving around.
6132390	6147156	C	0.8236792087554932	So therefore the heart rate is not going to be exactly the same but looking at what can be done and creating some models as well.
6147178	6156280	C	0.5954699516296387	So the idea around computational stuff also makes sense to test some of the ideas.
6157100	6158984	C	0.749006986618042	This is work that is building up.
6159022	6172110	C	0.9248977303504944	So we very much look forward to kind of people getting in touch, bouncing off ideas from each other, kind of looking at how we can move forward with this.
6173040	6177344	C	0.7808672189712524	It's not osteopathic specific is more than that.
6177382	6187280	C	0.6866464018821716	I think at least it can be manual therapy more broadening along those lines.
6188020	6200824	C	0.6852529048919678	You can look at sort of the role of some of this stuff in chronic conditions, not just pain, but other persistent physical symptoms and so on.
6200862	6202376	C	0.7351981401443481	So that's where we are.
6202478	6209560	C	0.540980875492096	It's time now to start kind of testing some of this stuff for sure and stop writing theoretical papers.
6212160	6212910	C	0.84200119972229	Cool.
6214000	6214940	A	0.7534393072128296	Zoe?
6218480	6222110	E	0.7583547830581665	Yeah, sort of what George said.
6226180	6235344	E	0.8949765563011169	We've had one paper accepted for MSK, so hopefully that will come out for everyone to read soon.
6235542	6236572	A	0.6109760403633118	What is MSK.
6236636	6263820	E	0.8433930277824402	We've got one waiting, so for more orthopedic general musculoskeletal muscle muscle and bones kind of patients and then the pediatrics one is almost ready to submit.
6264800	6279312	E	0.8884814381599426	And then, yeah, I guess we'll be looking towards seeing where it goes and what we can sort of empirically prove from all the theories that are kind of circulating and going from there.
6279366	6285744	E	0.7888785004615784	But hopefully discussions like what everyone said now will give everyone more ideas to.
6285782	6286610	D	0.6431205868721008	Sort of.
6288440	6299030	E	0.847465455532074	Where we're going or where we could go, and different ways to apply the principles and the frameworks that we've suggested so far.
6300300	6301000	A	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
6301150	6301960	A	0.6384354829788208	George?
6302540	6302952	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
6303006	6314700	C	0.8390421271324158	Just on the pediatrics, we actually have one of the first lines to start exploring is synchrony between mother, baby and practitioner.
6315680	6327756	C	0.806130588054657	Starting with not sure if you're going to we've been doing a bit of work around the effect of touch on premature babies.
6327948	6333744	C	0.6383469700813293	So we have those collaborations with hospitals in Italy would enable us to do some of that stuff.
6333862	6365804	C	0.9129154086112976	But we sort of start looking also looking at this whole concept of synchrony on a triadic kind of thing so the baby, the practitioner and the mother and see if actually if we find that the synchrony actually between mother and baby is a marker of for example, the baby would be some markers of autonomic change, changes in autonomic arousal, for example.
6365922	6373230	C	0.8655102252960205	Like we observed, for example, the effect of effective touch, gentle touch on the baby sat and so on.
6373840	6375260	A	0.8833861947059631	Thank you, Ian.
6378980	6399460	B	0.5683048963546753	George, just as you were saying about the challenge of a practitioner being moving whilst during a manual therapy session and I'm sort of aware of how that does lead to some difficulties, especially with the PPG sort of measurement of heart rate variability.
6400300	6413080	B	0.7025843262672424	I heard just an idea I heard about, I don't know if you've come across it a wearable ECG that it's aimed at increasing respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
6413840	6424590	B	0.5867822170257568	It vibrates and it stimulates the person, catches them at the top of their outbreath and it's designed to actually be used whilst you're walking around in everyday life.
6425940	6439044	B	0.7905440926551819	So I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity there because it's designed to A, increase RSA and B to be used whilst moving.
6439162	6443030	B	0.9093648791313171	That might be an interesting piece of kit to use.
6444840	6446390	C	0.5014309287071228	Yeah, absolutely.
6447720	6448470	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
6448840	6452440	A	0.8837546706199646	Blue or would anyone else like any comments?
6453980	6456410	F	0.8175237774848938	I just want to give a final thought.
6456780	6472110	F	0.8527172803878784	So something that I'm going to be thinking about for, I don't know, whoever knows how long is this idea of the emotional and physical body in terms of reference point.
6472640	6495028	F	0.7167346477508545	Right, so we studied in, I think, Live Stream 40, the FEP for Generic Quantum Systems, and it talked about how the FEP drives entanglement and in this way, when there's perfect learning, there's this overlapping of the reference point.
6495194	6507672	F	0.594016432762146	So I just wonder, how can an emotional body and a physical body be driven toward a more overlapping reference frame when those things are so fundamentally different?
6507806	6509610	F	0.8587468266487122	So I'm going to be thinking about that.
6511340	6512090	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
6512560	6513630	A	0.9677404165267944	Very cool.
