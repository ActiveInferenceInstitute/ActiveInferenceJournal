47924	53490	6	A	0.99986	This is a recorded and an archived Livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work.
53860	60160	7	A	0.99998	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams.
60820	68740	8	A	0.98874	If you want to learn more about the live streams or any other projects at Active Inferencelab, check out activeinference.org.
69800	85384	9	A	0.99376	Okay, today in 44.2, we are in our third discussion around the paper, therapeutic alliance as Active Inference the Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony from 2022 by the authors listed here.
85502	92968	10	A	1	And Ian and I had a dot zero where we contextualized and went over some of the outline of the paper.
93134	102620	11	A	0.99996	Then we had a great discussion last week with several of the authors in the dot one, and today we're here with some of the authors, and we'll see who else joins.
103120	107120	12	A	1	And we'll be continuing that discussion around the paper.
107270	112592	13	A	0.99994	We left a few threads, but also we can just take it wherever people would like to go.
112726	115668	14	A	1	And we'll begin just by saying hello.
115754	118756	15	A	0.99986	People can say anything they want.
118858	122580	16	A	0.95	And how is this week different than last week?
122730	125392	17	A	0.99977	How are we approaching this paper differently?
125456	136136	18	A	0.99893	Or what would we like to resolve or address in this two that was stimulated by the dot one or that we didn't get to in the one?
136238	138488	19	A	0.99992	Feel free to add anything in that area.
138654	140480	20	A	0.98034	So, I'm Daniel.
140580	160112	21	A	0.96104	I'm a researcher in California, and one piece in the two that I'd like to explore would be what are the entities that we're discussing here at what scales, and how to think about that in terms of their generative model and so on.
160246	162160	22	A	0.99	And I'll pass to Ian.
167780	168530	23	B	0.97	Hello.
169460	170508	24	B	0.99995	Thank you, Daniel.
170604	184052	25	B	0.94	And yes, I would like to maybe pick up on if we've got time on the topic of synchrony this week and what types of synchrony might we be talking about?
184186	199560	26	B	1	What things might be oscillating that come into sort of phase lock between two agents that have the potential to synchronize and then where do they head towards with their synchrony?
200380	216060	27	B	1	And then if we've got time, thinking about tying this all back to some of the core ideas about minimizing free energy and what does that mean in a therapeutic setting?
218900	219360	28	B	1	Yes.
219430	220272	29	B	0.99944	That's it, I think.
220326	221170	30	B	0.99973	Thank you.
222100	222896	31	A	0.99977	Awesome.
223078	226050	32	A	0.54074	All right, any of the authors, feel free to go for it.
229620	231670	33	C	0.93071	Zoe, play this first.
238600	240736	34	C	0.75094	Okay, so I'm George.
240848	242952	35	C	0.71762	I'm one of the authors on this paper.
243086	245940	36	C	0.64486	I'm an osteopath and researcher.
246020	250712	37	C	0.89	And where do I see this going forward?
250846	262520	38	C	0.99	I pretty much enjoyed the interaction we had last week and very happy to kind of be left by you guys, Ian and Daniel, and anybody else that want to join.
262600	278284	39	C	0.95	I think we can definitely explore those ideas about the synchronization to agents, and arguably more than two agents when we operate in a kind of not in a diadic setting, but actually in a triadic setting.
278332	288372	40	C	1	For example, pediatric care, kind of elderly care and so on, actually, there's an additional agent in the whole thing.
288426	291588	41	C	0.99979	So what do I look forward to?
291594	302650	42	C	0.99	The discussion kind of stimulate some ideas about ways in which we can move forward with this to the more empirical state of the research.
305590	306062	43	B	0.98361	Great.
306136	306950	44	A	0.95782	Zoe.
308810	310322	45	D	0.98177	Hi, I'm Zoe.
310466	316600	46	D	0.51026	I'm an Osteopath as well, based in Singapore, and I'm the primary author for this paper.
317210	323686	47	D	0.96	Yeah, happy to be led by anyone that wants to where we want to go, but definitely happy to talk about synchrony.
323798	334686	48	D	1	I think, as George said, it would be important to talk about not just diadic, but triadic or otherwise, because I think that adds a lot of depth to it.
334708	342560	49	D	1	But also it's easier to sort of discuss the effects of synchrony and also the fact that you can be.
346450	348880	50	A	0.58374	Okay, lost Zoe for a second.
351570	353966	51	D	0.99989	Anyone that wants to ask questions.
354148	354542	52	A	0.59034	Okay.
354596	360130	53	A	0.99941	Also, Zoe, is there, like, any other microphone to use, or could you speak closer to the microphone?
363750	367006	54	D	0.99977	I'm just using my laptop, so there isn't really a microphone.
367118	372114	55	D	1	I can take my headphones off if that makes a difference.
372312	372914	56	A	0.99991	It's fine.
372952	374900	57	A	0.99681	It's just a little quiet, but it's fine.
376470	377038	58	D	0.59379	Okay.
377144	377750	59	D	0.84081	Sorry.
377900	379414	60	A	0.99	Oh, no, it's totally all good.
379452	380438	61	A	0.99964	Just want us to check.
380524	381254	62	A	0.99616	Okay.
381452	382054	63	A	0.53735	All right.
382092	387100	64	A	0.99997	Let us pick up with the synchrony then.
387550	404080	65	A	0.99961	So I guess just to kind of recall, how was this question of synchrony approached in the active inference literature and maybe even outside of the active inference literature, and then how was synchrony approached in this paper?
404850	411860	66	A	0.82917	Why was that such a core topic in this approach that the authors took?
415830	429366	67	D	1	I think we started with synchrony as the main part, mainly because when we were talking about the therapeutic alliance, synchrony and getting on with the other person is kind of key.
429468	438886	68	D	1	And the way that we approached this paper, primarily in terms of a lot of the aspects of how we achieved that good therapeutic alliance was through synchrony.
438998	444886	69	D	0.99901	So that's kind of where that's one of the reasons through active inference.
445078	468418	70	D	1	It was also about I started the research when I was looking at it right from sort of the start and looking at how communication worked and why people would want to sort of synchronize together and why people to implement active inference into sort of the structure that we had.
468584	497600	71	D	1	It was important to kind of see why that would be beneficial because we wanted to use or we like to say that the synchrony enables us to work together to then therefore save free energy, be more efficient, and then that's how we very much used it to apply this active inference sort of framework around it.
498210	504030	72	D	1	And so I felt that it was very key without the synchrony element.
505170	514370	73	D	0.97	It was kind of the backbone into which a lot of the aspects of active inference in the way that we achieve therapeutic alliance seemed to sort of center around.
514440	530498	74	D	0.99974	Without that connection between the different people, we wouldn't be able to save energy to work together, to have a better relationship with our practitioners, with the patients and practitioner.
530514	535930	75	D	0.59323	We wouldn't be able to get the clinical applications and benefits from it.
536080	545574	76	D	0.98413	So I saw synchrony as sort of the key medal to sort of get to where the sort of paper was.
545632	553360	77	D	0.93001	So it was sort of a key concept to use in order to implement it all together.
555010	555870	78	D	0.99704	George.
557730	579910	79	C	0.84	Yeah, let's say when we started the project actually kind of putting some ideas along the lines of how could we apply predictive processing and the free energy active inference within osteopathy and within the osteopathic setting.
580970	606170	80	C	0.44206	Synchrony came along actually after the initial discussion with Karl Frieston that kind of suggested know look into this stuff because actually could be quite a robust way of understanding what goes on in the clinic room when two people are working together with a specific kind of aim.
607070	630680	81	C	0.99772	There is a little bit of literature in psychotherapy kind of demonstrating that actually the therapeutic alliance becomes much more robust when two people synchronize and both at the kind of behavioral but also biological level.
631770	652954	82	C	0.85	And it was nothing about sort of okay, this is about pure verbal communication, nonverbal but primarily by kind of copying body movements and so on to think, okay, how can this be applied in the context of actually an approach that is largely hands on based as a manual therapy?
653082	655582	83	C	0.99035	So that's where it kind of started from.
655716	669406	84	C	1	It was one way of trying, like Zoe said, kind of looking at therapeutic alliance when people interact to try and understand what goes on in the diadic setting.
669598	683240	85	C	0.92365	Kind of two people but also a little bit beyond of what happens when there's actually more people involved in that therapeutic relationship that need to be consulted, need to be involved in the process and so on.
685870	688170	86	C	0.98449	That was the kind of early stage.
690430	709650	87	C	0.81	And then we thought that actually this is a good way of understanding a little bit more about how we can create the conditions of developing a strong kind of ecological niche that is based on that synchrony of that sort of understanding of that give and take.
709720	714046	88	C	0.6	Like a little bit like we talked about last week, the kind of the Bird song.
714238	721598	89	C	1	People taking turns, kind of understanding, listening, okay, acting kind of taking on, go back and so on.
721624	728002	90	C	1	And that's sort of, in a sense, like kind of a nice wave that goes back and forth.
728066	732610	91	C	0.59	But it is a kind of very nice and tranquil kind of wave.
732770	747626	92	C	0.99997	Not a one that just crashes and destroys everything, but actually one where once that kind of goes on a little bit like the pendulum kind of analogy once you introduce that nice pendulum kind of things happen.
747808	755360	93	C	0.99998	That's where we sort of thought it could be one way of exploring the whole process of care.
757650	759310	94	A	0.99843	Thank you, Ian.
762210	763200	95	B	0.99747	Thank you.
765430	780262	96	B	0.99459	I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony and the little bits I've read in the literature about how measurable things that might be able to synchronize between one or two or more people.
780396	783978	97	B	0.94817	So, Daniel, I think we discussed this in the zero.
784064	794970	98	B	0.99922	So choirs singing together, they have been shown their heart rates kind of synchronize with their breathing.
796350	804350	99	B	1	And I think in the paper there was some references cited for similar sort of stuff in drumming circles, for example.
804500	823570	100	B	0.9957	So that really interests me and I can kind of begin to see how in a therapeutic setting, that kind of synchrony could lead someone who's maybe stressed and anxious into a kind of more healthy increased parasympathetic activity and that is conducive to healing.
825350	843670	101	B	0.64	But I've also got these other sort of nagging things about synchrony as well that maybe I touched on the dot zero, which is what are we synchronizing towards and is it always beneficial?
843750	850990	102	B	0.89887	So the less kind of lockstep synchrony that you talked about, Daniel.
851650	859710	103	B	0.99834	So maybe it's just, let's say a child saying, mummy, mummy, mummy, waving their arms around and then the mum synchronize, they synchronize their attention together.
859860	863134	104	B	0.99908	So you get mother and child and then you've got a choice.
863182	865410	105	B	0.99555	So there's some aspect that's synchronized.
865910	875138	106	B	1	I think in the paper it talked about the arms and the limbs and the voice kind of synchronizing and the facial expressions.
875234	884486	107	B	1	But a caregiver might then lead the child to a soothing kind of parasympathetic way soothe it.
884508	893782	108	B	0.99999	Or it might say, give it a clip behind the ear and say, children us to be seen and not heard and try and stop the attention.
893926	901690	109	B	1	The attention is synchronized, but the action may not be therapeutic.
903790	923694	110	B	0.92	Yeah, I'm just sort of thinking about where you know, where just because something's synchronized, does it mean it's always minimizing free energy or just because things in the therapeutic world go in and out of fashion?
923742	927106	111	B	0.99969	So frontal lobotomy is okay, we don't do that anymore.
927138	933370	112	B	1	But for a while there was some kind of synchronized thinking in the therapeutic world that that's a good idea for people.
933440	957440	113	B	1	And there are ideas that I hear in the wider kind of therapy world that are fashionable and they're being applied, but in 50 years time we may look that they may have been leading people away from minimizing free energy or improving health.
961410	962430	114	B	0.82983	My thoughts.
962850	963262	115	C	0.86656	Okay.
963316	963582	116	A	0.99984	Awesome.
963636	964450	117	A	0.68	Yeah, a lot there.
964520	965250	118	A	0.99619	George.
967190	973240	119	C	1	I think the interesting thing, there are nagging questions there for sure.
974330	986810	120	C	1	The first one, do we always synchronize and when if you don't synchronize what we're going to do, because clearly there are cases where we know the therapeutic relationship is going nowhere.
987310	995718	121	C	0.90065	We can say whatever we can, try our best, but actually, there is resistance to change from the patients.
995814	999054	122	C	0.99974	We end up not understanding each other.
999252	1004042	123	C	1	And arguably, that's a relationship that will not evolve.
1004186	1007070	124	C	0.99	And, well, you might even get to a point at the end.
1007140	1009902	125	C	0.99926	Maybe it'd be a good idea to go and see a colleague of mine kind of thing.
1009956	1013298	126	C	0.60221	Okay, so do we synchronize with everybody?
1013384	1014740	127	C	0.83175	No, clearly not.
1016310	1038442	128	C	1	Is there any value understanding this stuff by sometimes understanding that some kind of gestures and sort of body language and so on, voice, sound, sort of communication style, we're probably giving us cues maybe to adapt a little bit to try and synchronize a little bit better.
1038496	1039814	129	C	1	I think that's useful.
1039862	1043798	130	C	1	I think important in order to be a good communicator.
1043894	1054878	131	C	1	I think first and foremost, sometimes people worry too much about the technical skills and the ability of doing X and Y and doing some miracles and so on.
1054964	1062002	132	C	0.84094	Arguably the first thing that people need to be in a clinical setting is good communicator and a pretty good, nice person.
1062056	1062274	133	C	0.98601	Okay?
1062312	1077798	134	C	1	And I think if that's there, I think we create the conditions in good communicators likely to have potentially better outcomes that guys that basically don't care and sort of they're the experts and so on.
1077964	1081638	135	C	1	The other question is, is it always about minimizing free energy?
1081724	1089274	136	C	0.99997	Because there are situations where probably you want to short circuit the whole thing, isn't it?
1089392	1093354	137	C	1	You want to sort of flatten a little bit of that sort of sensory state.
1093472	1113060	138	C	1	You want to create a condition where the only way you can sort of change the generative model is actually by creating a massive surprise, a massive prediction error that arguably surprises the system in a way like, wow, what just happened?
1113590	1127880	139	C	0.99	And actually, oh, okay, I don't think it's always about minimizing free energy, but sometimes I think you want to shock the whole thing because the system on the other side wants to minimize free energy for sure.
1129210	1142266	140	C	1	If I'm a kind of chronic pain patient and I'm scared of moving and you tell me to move and so on, the reaction is I anticipate the likelihood of movement leading to pain.
1142368	1148254	141	C	0.59	I anticipate the consequences of actions in the future, the typical active inference model.
1148372	1150558	142	C	1	And I lock, I don't move.
1150644	1164370	143	C	0.99993	So I probably want to short circuit the whole thing to create a condition where it's actually okay to move because it's not going to cause any harm, is it, through synchrony?
1165830	1166878	144	C	1	Maybe it isn't.
1166974	1174614	145	C	0.99771	Okay, so I think that's not, I think, a kind of one size fits all kind of thing.
1174812	1200240	146	C	1	And I don't think it's just about sort of always that minimizing free energy because I think creating change that is meaningful change probably needs a little bit more of it needs to destroy that sort of strong prior kind of thing so I can implant another chip kind of thing in a metaphorical way.
1201490	1213326	147	C	0.75	And that's why we know in some mental health conditions why some types of drugs like catamine and so on, create that condition that sort of zeros.
1213358	1215986	148	C	0.99	The whole thing is a bit like you reset the button, isn't it?
1216008	1217166	149	C	1	The computer is stuck.
1217278	1219442	150	C	1	What you do, you've tried everything.
1219496	1222034	151	C	1	You unplug the computer and then you try again.
1222072	1223602	152	C	1	The whole thing reboots, isn't it?
1223656	1231890	153	C	0.69357	So I think sometimes that's the analogy of maybe what we want to achieve in the setting is it through synchrony?
1232230	1235900	154	C	0.93	I personally, I don't know, and I'm not entirely sure.
1237390	1244138	155	C	0.92	Of course, if the people started understanding each other, then that creates the conditions for this thing probably to happen.
1244224	1252814	156	C	0.99977	Because if you don't understand me as a practitioner, I don't understand you as a patient, it's pretty hard that actually I create the condition for change.
1252852	1258000	157	C	0.73717	So maybe it's through synchrony, but again, as a sort of big question marks, really.
1261170	1261920	158	A	0.84804	Thanks.
1262710	1263122	159	A	0.57	Yes.
1263176	1264180	160	A	0.60445	Zoe, please.
1266230	1273650	161	D	0.99	Yeah, so I think going off what I mean, overall, the goal would be to minimize free energy.
1273720	1279798	162	D	1	But to be able to do that, you have to sort of at some point challenge it, right?
1279884	1284198	163	D	0.98653	You're not going to have the same belief that you think is the most efficient.
1284374	1294746	164	D	0.99984	When you're born to when you die, the way that you become reduced energy is going to change over time.
1294848	1297366	165	D	0.91452	You'll see that especially in sort of pediatrics.
1297398	1298810	166	D	1	You see it in sport.
1299230	1308494	167	D	0.78578	There's a lot of studies with running, for example, that show that the more you run, often the more mileage that people do when they run, the more efficient they get.
1308612	1316130	168	D	0.99991	So I think free energy is, yes, we all want to reduce it, but at some point we've got to update it and challenge it, right?
1316200	1322098	169	D	0.99987	So it won't be sort of just this linear thing where you're constantly just changing it.
1322104	1324066	170	D	0.93092	You've got to update it and challenge it at some point.
1324088	1336220	171	D	0.76026	So it will sort of be a little bit of a roller coaster and have a few dips where you got to take that risk to see if there's another way that is more efficient, that will save it more.
1337150	1342378	172	D	0.99947	Whether synchrony is always necessary, I'm not sure.
1342544	1363362	173	D	0.82	I definitely think that when you're unsure whether or if your prior is not so precise and you're not 100% sure that that is the best way to do whatever you're doing, or you're not 100% certain that your belief explains what's going on, then I think you're more likely to synchronize with others.
1363416	1373874	174	D	0.53	I think once you're quite certain on what you think and what you're going to do, then it's a lot harder to synchronize.
1374002	1383334	175	D	1	Like with the cognitive sort of immunity when you've got chronic pain, it's a lot harder to change that because you're convinced that you're right.
1383372	1387722	176	D	0.9996	You've had this pain for years, maybe, and you know what it's like.
1387776	1389990	177	D	0.99992	If you bend forward, it's going to hurt.
1390070	1392940	178	D	0.99999	So why would you bother to challenge that?
1395970	1407230	179	D	1	I think there's a lot of studies that show that, especially with sort of babies, that they synchronize with their when they're younger the synchrony is very consistent.
1408210	1416414	180	D	1	Obviously they need to work with their caregiver to get their alleystatic needs and everything that they need to keep surviving.
1416462	1426482	181	D	1	But it shows that they do still think when they're adults but the time when they're older or in adulthood that they do think is when they're unsure.
1426626	1435830	182	D	0.98679	When something happens and you are near that caregiver and you don't know, you still sort of rely on them.
1435900	1441402	183	D	0.99993	Say I don't know, you get into a car accident or something and there's a big shock and you're not sure.
1441536	1450714	184	D	0.99998	Often the child will still, no matter how old they are, will look to the parent, obviously unless the parent is very elderly.
1450762	1455760	185	D	1	But generally speaking in times of uncertainty you will look towards someone else.
1456450	1459930	186	D	0.99964	So I think is synchrony always necessary?
1460010	1476840	187	D	0.9786	No but I think if you're not 100% certain with your priors and you are questioning it or there is a doubt of that questioning it, then I think synchrony will play more of a role in it and I'll pass it back to you.
1477690	1478966	188	A	0.99995	Awesome, thanks.
1479068	1484242	189	A	1	Yeah, just thinking about beliefs in the way that we might talk about them.
1484396	1485094	190	A	0.99982	Hey, blue.
1485142	1485690	191	A	0.99999	Welcome.
1485840	1488886	192	A	0.99998	Just the way that we might conversationally talk about beliefs.
1488998	1496182	193	A	0.99993	If somebody is unsure about something that's when they look to be synchronized by some other informational resource.
1496246	1505338	194	A	0.99934	I'm not sure what time this thing opens so I'm going to look it up in this way or I'm going to ask this person or I'm not sure where to go so I'm going to follow the crowd.
1505434	1512286	195	A	0.99999	We see that kind of in the ant pheromone trail, we see that in the social media, all these different areas.
1512318	1555518	196	A	1	And then conversely when somebody does have a more confident, more built up prior then that's more like going their own way and potentially being more resistant to external contrasting information and then translating from that one conversational meaning of belief like I believe that is going to open at this time into a broader Bayesian perspective on Bayesian brain and body and thinking about pain and perception as also parameters that can be seen as beliefs in this Bayesian sense.
1555604	1571586	197	A	0.62265	So not always like a psychological experienced belief but in some statistical way it's like they're held stances that are updated in some way or partially or completely by certain kinds of incoming information.
1571768	1582534	198	A	0.95979	So Ian and then also this is going to be I think very interesting to return to the free energy minimization and unpack what we mean by free energy there.
1582572	1583154	199	A	0.99166	So Ian.
1583202	1583960	200	A	0.99997	Go for.
1586410	1586966	201	B	0.89108	Thanks.
1587068	1596506	202	B	0.7704	So, yeah, I'm just sort of wanting to check that some of the language used in other realms of therapy.
1596538	1620738	203	B	0.99985	So this idea of self regulation and co regulation, are we saying here that this synchrony in the therapeutic reliance is a form of co regulation that we hear a lot about in people with disorder problems of their autonomic nervous system?
1620824	1626838	204	B	1	And then we say, you go to a therapist to help co regulate your autonomic nervous system.
1626924	1641210	205	B	1	Is that what we're saying as synchrony is the kind of mechanism for co regulation which I believe fits with what you're saying, zoe that children need that more and as adults we might do that occasionally.
1642110	1648214	206	B	0.93	And then I'm just thinking also other forms of therapeutic synchrony and co regulation.
1648262	1674214	207	B	0.94569	So meeting friends for a you know, I might be having a bit of a stressful week or a wobble in some way, and then I meet some friends and we kind of seek counsel in each other, have a synchronize our movement of our hands to our mouth with a coffee cup or listen to some music together, tap our feet together.
1674332	1677874	208	B	1	And that's a kind of therapeutic.
1677922	1682680	209	B	0.99513	So are we all kind of doing this on and off all the time?
1684590	1686780	210	B	0.58786	They're my thoughts or questions.
1689310	1689674	211	B	0.88	Yes.
1689712	1691946	212	A	0.95962	George zoe, then?
1691968	1692570	213	A	0.89556	George.
1695390	1695802	214	E	0.99	Yeah.
1695856	1697210	215	D	0.99675	No, I just wanted to say yes.
1697280	1699242	216	D	0.99986	With the co regulation.
1699306	1720500	217	D	0.99	I think that we kind of not always but I think we do add an element to try and suggest that we'd like to say that we in part help co regulation and as a practitioner to achieve sort of recovery and reduce pain and help.
1721190	1742298	218	D	1	I think we all want to say that we help in that process and that we help regulate their sort of disruptive pattern, whether that's inflammation, whether that's pain, whatever sort of metric that you want to rate your treatment by or whatever your treatment goals are that you're sort of working towards.
1742384	1756480	219	D	1	I think we all want to say that we sort of help regulate which ways we regulate in terms of whether we actually change their heart rate or things like that.
1758130	1763074	220	D	0.88782	We're not always so specific about we don't have the research to kind of show that.
1763112	1780278	221	D	1	But I think certainly there is elements of sympathetic and parasympathetic things that we do, as well as sort of the intent to co regulate even if we don't sort of empirically do it or achieve it.
1780364	1799920	222	D	0.99995	Whether just that reassurance that we're attempting to help regulate their pain, I think is sort of the intention that I hope that as a practitioner I am giving off to my patients and I'll let George speak.
1804610	1832370	223	C	0.96	I think if you come from a manual therapy background, a touch based, hands on approach, one could argue, or old school kind of beliefs in the profession, christian Osteopathy would argue that actually how you achieve that core regulation, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic parasympathetic is primarily through the use of techniques.
1832450	1852960	224	C	0.81	You use a technique in a particular part of the body and this affects the parasympathetic part and so on the vagus nerve and all that stuff that sort of implies there is a tool by which you can apply that stuff, treat that particular bit and by miracle modulate everything.
1853650	1867310	225	C	0.99	I used to be there, no longer there because the evidence isn't strong enough to actually support those clients on the other hand, if we add another element, which is the element the synchrony.
1867470	1884306	226	C	1	And the synchrony here goes beyond just that sort of passive practitioner led type of intervention into something that implies communication, implies alignment attuning to the environment.
1884418	1887434	227	C	1	And the environment there is the practitioner as well.
1887552	1892074	228	C	0.82527	So the other person in the room, the guy that is facilitating the process.
1892192	1900174	229	C	0.58286	So it sort of takes us, I think, away from this idea that everything is about touches, everything is about the manual stuff and so on.
1900292	1908446	230	C	1	But it becomes a kind of a multipronged approach where touch matters, that communication matters as much as touch.
1908628	1916722	231	C	1	And it's not a technique X, Y or NZ, but it's actually the whole package of care that's likely to enable us to get there.
1916856	1923926	232	C	0.56392	So is it similar I like your analogy to sort of tough day and so on.
1923948	1939740	233	C	0.61	You go out, you need to see your friends, you need to synchronize in a different environment because ultimately people will talk to each other and correlate regulate each other even in terms of reducing allostatic load of a tough week and so on.
1940510	1945446	234	C	0.99979	There are kind of things that are similar to what happens in the clinical setting.
1945558	1949360	235	C	1	One of them, we're probably thinking about reward systems as well.
1949890	1957950	236	C	0.99975	There's a sort of a participation in something that is likely to, even if uncomfortable, is let is going to lead to some improvement.
1959810	1975080	237	C	0.6216	Maybe there's some dopamine stuff, maybe there is a reward pathways that are kind of involved in the whole thing, like having a drink in the same having a therapeutic intervention that ultimately is going to get me to a better state.
1975530	1998720	238	C	0.69	I think it's very analogous to moving away from the free energy principle and to an area that kind of works alongside that inactivism, the concept of sense making, what inactivists would argue participatory sense making.
1999170	2005578	239	C	0.99978	So synchrony could be kind of also looked from that lens, from that perspective.
2005754	2024070	240	C	0.66035	Whereas two people or more than two people either in a group having a drink and all kind of helping each other because I listen, or in a therapeutic setting that sort of participatory things, making minimizing free energy or autopoeasies for the kind of the inactivists.
2025050	2034730	241	C	0.99769	Actually, I think we sort of looking at the same phenomena, maybe with different language, but arguably the same kind of phenomena.
2035710	2044650	242	C	1	I think it's that package that probably helps core regulation rather than just one intervention.
2045810	2048830	243	A	0.99367	Thank you, Blue.
2049170	2049920	244	A	0.99995	Welcome.
2050530	2054000	245	A	0.95118	Do you want to add anything or ask anything?
2056370	2059854	246	F	0.99935	Not right off the bat, just hi, it's nice to be here with you guys.
2059892	2064130	247	F	0.99982	I'm sorry I missed last week and I've really enjoyed the discussions of the paper so far.
2064200	2066754	248	F	1	And I'll jump in, in a little bit.
2066792	2070370	249	F	1	I think you guys were engrossed in a good conversation.
2072090	2073046	250	A	0.99824	Okay, awesome.
2073148	2078278	251	A	0.99959	So the Dopamine angle and a few other things we'll return to.
2078364	2099182	252	A	1	But we were talking about minimizing free energy and I wanted to show a few images from the textbook because even those who have seen free energy come up in a lot of different settings, sometimes returning to the basics is a generator that helps us take it in many other ways.
2099316	2112462	253	A	1	And for those who are maybe focused more on the clinical setting or have more of that background, this can provide a little other tissues around the connective tissue.
2112526	2115762	254	A	1	Free energy is being used like a connective tissue here.
2115816	2117678	255	A	0.71393	It's bridging a lot of different ideas.
2117774	2122226	256	A	0.78602	It's helping us connect different sensory modalities and therapeutic modalities.
2122418	2127058	257	A	0.9997	So just a few cool images from the active inference textbook.
2127234	2151306	258	A	0.55914	So here is Figure 2.3 and it's the action perception loop and the two ways that discrepancies related to predictions or expectations, the two ways that discrepancies about observations can be reduced just qualitatively is through changing belief and changing action.
2151498	2158454	259	A	1	And it's some blend of those two that individual entities are engaged in in this action perception loop.
2158602	2188300	260	A	1	And then when we're specifically talking about free energy, there's some type of equation, this is like a simple form of it that is going to make that discrepancy minimization tractable and possible to calculate for at least us doing statistics from outside the system, if not for the system itself to do.
2188910	2194902	261	A	1	And what is the real sort of hidden goal?
2194966	2197898	262	A	1	Is this minimization of true surprise.
2198074	2203850	263	A	0.93	But the minimization of true surprise is intractable or it's inaccessible.
2204010	2208054	264	A	1	And so free energy serves as like this upper bound.
2208202	2219726	265	A	0.99939	Whereas if we can reduce this upper bound, we're getting implicitly closer to this asymptotic reduction of surprise.
2219918	2231750	266	A	0.99875	So who is doing this reduction of surprise that relates to the entity question what is the entity that's actually doing free energy minimization?
2232330	2237260	267	A	1	And so what are the entities that we're talking about here?
2238430	2242060	268	A	0.99989	What does it mean to minimize free energy?
2244910	2254106	269	A	1	I liked how earlier it was brought up when sometimes where that free energy minimization was going with the flow and then sometimes when there was a flow disrupt.
2254218	2259858	270	A	0.99287	So what is free energy minimization and what are the entities and how are we modeling that?
2259944	2261860	271	A	0.91954	Ian and then anyone else?
2265670	2266420	272	B	0.99977	Thanks.
2266790	2275842	273	B	1	Yeah, that question of what are the entities and linking it back to George's point about sense making and inactivism.
2275906	2294858	274	B	0.94698	So in the paper there was some really interesting stuff on realizing that we're all alike in the therapeutic alliance and relating that back to sense making.
2295024	2309762	275	B	0.89366	I'm thinking that therapeutically or in a manual therapy or meeting friends, the outcome might be I'm not a weirdo, I haven't done anything wrong, everything's okay.
2309816	2314574	276	B	0.9999	Again, I'm relaxed and that's therapeutic.
2314702	2318898	277	B	0.99997	So I'm amongst people who are very much alike me.
2319064	2320370	278	B	1	And that's the sense making.
2320440	2322146	279	B	0.99994	There's the pattern recognition.
2322338	2326600	280	B	0.76177	I'm a valuable member of my tribe, however you want to describe it.
2331210	2334470	281	B	1	But we're never completely identical.
2335850	2336710	282	B	0.99996	Or are we?
2336780	2337720	283	B	1	I don't know.
2340830	2344694	284	B	1	The proposal in the paper is that that's the ultimate realization that we're all alike.
2344742	2345774	285	B	1	And I can kind of see.
2345812	2348910	286	B	0.99987	That that's a kind of relieving thing to realize.
2350050	2352080	287	B	1	But we're similar.
2354130	2367380	288	B	0.94392	I'm similar to my pet dog in that I've got eyes and I breathe and my heart beats and I can synchronize in some ways with that, and it feels nice, but my dog can't help me do my accounts, for example.
2368630	2372670	289	B	0.97949	So, yes, this alikeness.
2372750	2376420	290	B	1	And how does that fit into sense making?
2378550	2379970	291	A	0.99966	Thanks, Blue.
2380870	2385850	292	F	0.99923	So, as I've been reading the textbook, I've been thinking a lot about the hidden states.
2385920	2393740	293	F	1	And it's interesting to think about that in terms of using touch to kind of resolve uncertainty about the hidden states.
2394110	2409620	294	F	0.99999	Because while a state might be hidden to the patient, when you present with some, like, I've got a pain in my shoulder or something like that, it might be easy for the therapist to say, oh, that's this, this, and I push here and tweak this, and then it's better.
2410950	2422142	295	F	0.99775	So it might be hidden to the patient but not hidden to the doctor, or hidden to the doctor and the patient, or hidden to the patient but not the doctor, or the doctor but not the patient.
2422206	2424054	296	F	0.99993	So it might be like all of these things.
2424092	2429334	297	F	1	And so it's like working together, this kind of synchrony to resolve uncertainty about a hidden state.
2429372	2438218	298	F	1	And I've thought a lot about who's making the observation and who's doing the state observing and who is the state hidden to.
2438304	2450126	299	F	0.99	And it brings back the paper that you guys mentioned in the zero the communication as active inference because it really is like a bi directional, harmonious kind of thing happening.
2450228	2450880	300	C	0.9391	Right.
2451490	2452334	301	A	0.99991	Awesome.
2452532	2453278	302	A	0.9985	Thanks.
2453444	2454160	303	A	1	Yes.
2454610	2455550	304	A	0.50741	George.
2461110	2461860	305	D	0.95	Yeah.
2463110	2469502	306	C	0.96899	So actually, starting with the hidden states, who's observing, who's been observed?
2469646	2484714	307	C	1	I think the free energy model or picture the typical representation with the two agents and or one agent in the world and internal states, external states and so on.
2484832	2494694	308	C	0.99991	If you have the two agents, there's something in the middle that clearly is the ground where we kind of try to achieve some form of alignment.
2494742	2508638	309	C	1	And then that sort of implies the reading of someone else's internal state, I think, who makes the observation, who's been observed and so on.
2508724	2533074	310	C	0.87	I think, again, is the birdsong is a give and take because there are clearly situations where you may be telling your patient that actually is nothing to worry about, for example, where you're not particularly sure about what's going on and the patient can clearly read in your body language that, no, it's hiding something from me.
2533132	2533740	311	C	0.96882	Right.
2534350	2537180	312	C	0.99917	It's something there that doesn't feel right.
2538110	2538860	313	C	0.55223	Actually.
2540430	2559550	314	C	0.88992	There's an interesting phenomena, for example, in chronic conditions, which is the concept of cognitive immunization, where it's very common these days for patient goes and sees a practitioner, has read, has consulted with Dr.
2559620	2560750	315	C	0.99954	Google to start.
2560900	2561310	316	C	0.94567	Dr.
2561380	2566254	317	C	0.99652	Google said it could be x, Y, and Z, typically the worst case scenario.
2566382	2569922	318	C	0.99738	Goes and sees doctor number one.
2569976	2572674	319	C	0.99	Doctor number one says, yeah, you know what?
2572792	2574022	320	C	0.99879	Nothing to worry about.
2574156	2575654	321	C	0.99291	There's nothing wrong with you.
2575772	2582934	322	C	0.98949	Patient has got pain, kind of saying, all right, I don't trust you kind of thing, then goes and sees practitioner number two.
2582972	2607070	323	C	0.99994	That comes with a different story and yeah, okay, maybe you forget about if forgotten about something goes to practitioner number three and so on and gets through a process where authors argue that the system becomes cognitively immune to any new explanations because the expectation is surely there's something wrong with me.
2607140	2625574	324	C	0.99997	So clearly in those conditions, if we take from this lens, one could argue, yeah, as a patient, I'm observing you, I'm kind of reading your internal states, which is I don't trust you kind of thing because you're telling me something, but actually something that potentially you don't believe either, okay.
2625692	2640506	325	C	0.99987	Or this thing about, let's do cognitive reassurance because most nonspecific back pain or neck pain, one cannot say that's clearly a particular tissue responsible for the pain, the symptoms and so on.
2640528	2644970	326	C	0.99888	So you say, okay, there's nothing serious with you, so what's wrong with me?
2645120	2652846	327	C	0.73	You clearly can't tell the patient you've got nonspecific back pain because for the patient that means you haven't got a clue about what's wrong with me.
2652948	2656526	328	C	0.99994	Or you're implying that something upstairs in my head, I'm making it up.
2656628	2666382	329	C	0.77512	So patients observe us for sure, and they know when we kind of are confident and so on, and when we're not so confident.
2666446	2669986	330	C	0.95	And maybe we're not entirely sure if actually the whole thing is going to happen.
2670088	2680662	331	C	0.99999	In the same way we observe patients, we start observing them when they come through the door, when you first greet them and so on, hi, how are you doing?
2680716	2696060	332	C	0.98697	Before COVID times, shaking hands and so on were a pretty good first kind of getting into someone else's internal state because just the handshake, the quality of the amount of pressure, the confidence and so on.
2696530	2701870	333	C	0.99984	There were cases say this person is anxious, this person is down, is depressed, and so on.
2701940	2712580	334	C	1	And you could get that down to when you do clinical examination, you touch, you observe, you feel, you palpate and so on.
2714630	2718130	335	C	0.5484	That implies that there is a lot of unconscious stuff.
2718200	2730902	336	C	0.5923	That process comes through, arrives through our sensory, our sensorian and we make something out of it.
2730956	2746640	337	C	0.98947	So I think that's what we kind of one of the things we try to explore through this stuff about try to understand someone else's internal state, predicting a little bit of their mental state.
2748210	2759380	338	C	0.97	And that's where synchrony and that's where alignment kind of plays that important role because if there's no alignment, I can't clearly guess what's wrong going on.
2760230	2768002	339	C	0.99	The stuff about Ian, what you mentioned about sense making and so on, sense making is quite an interesting thing.
2768056	2775890	340	C	0.94	You said, okay, we're not like a patient is a patient and the practitioner is a practitioner.
2776050	2779830	341	C	0.9931	There is that power differential as well.
2779980	2781910	342	C	0.91083	There's the doctor, there's the patient.
2782650	2796174	343	C	0.99999	When one is an expert and when the other is an expert and things alternate the whole thing about sense making and actually minimization of free energy and so on.
2796292	2815300	344	C	0.99945	Sense making is quite an interesting thing too when we look at some clinical conditions and there's some beautiful stuff written about, for example, mental health and inactive approaches and looking at, for example depression as a disorder of sense making, for example.
2816310	2828354	345	C	1	And you see that sometimes with patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems that also have a comorbidity they have depression.
2828482	2829814	346	C	0.99921	What came first?
2830012	2832840	347	C	0.88	The depression of the back or the back pain?
2833370	2849520	348	C	1	One could argue that if I suffer from chronic back pain and I can't get out of the house I can't see my friends, I can't walk my dog, I can't play with my children and so on the world stops kind of making sense, right?
2850130	2857566	349	C	1	I don't go out because outside is a cruel world and it's kind of full of dangers and so on.
2857588	2871800	350	C	0.99994	So I stay in a safe environment which is my home watching telly, kind of complaining about myself to myself and I become depressed because I'm stuck there.
2872250	2905950	351	C	0.9792	So the therapeutic encounter that sort of nice ecological niche in a sense creates opportunity for sense making to understand where there's patterns for example, rigid behavior, rigid thinking that actually by understanding, by interacting can potentially start sort of taking the patient in a particular direction which is this kind of road to recovery.
2906930	2923160	352	C	1	And one could argue that if someone starts feeling kind of better in themselves symptoms reduce a little bit, can start doing a little bit more, can start again engaging with the world.
2923850	2928838	353	C	0.99999	Maybe the other stuff about feeling miserable would get better as well.
2928924	2933010	354	C	0.99	And I think that's sometimes what we see in musculoskeletal care is this stuff.
2933180	2943100	355	C	0.99971	We don't treat mental health conditions and I don't think we should make those claims because they're clearly boundaries and competences and so on.
2944030	2963540	356	C	0.94	But the patient that has got, for example, a chronic musculoskeletal problem and gets better and gets an impact that impact changes their quality of life changes their ability to become an agent again because pain they lost their agency because of pain.
2964150	2982454	357	C	1	I think that's where the beauty of this understanding this stuff kind of comes is you can impact on different levels of the person of the self that is clearly not just that embodied self, that body but it's beyond that embodied self.
2982572	2988860	358	C	0.99	Is this multidimensional kind of what is to be a person kind of thing, right?
2990830	3004062	359	C	0.99	I think at times it's about kind of reading the other understanding the other guy's internal state is about sort of doing the right thing at the right time.
3004116	3015202	360	C	0.99956	Because I know there's a cue that tells me maybe if I do this stuff this could be really one way of getting surprising the system in a very positive way.
3015336	3018210	361	C	0.64229	Okay, so I've just been pontificating.
3019030	3023154	362	C	0.68887	Zoe yes.
3023352	3023774	363	E	0.64	Yeah.
3023832	3025858	364	E	0.72	I think oh, gosh.
3025954	3027750	365	D	0.7681	Let me take my hand down.
3027820	3028294	366	D	0.69334	Okay.
3028412	3028742	367	E	1	Yeah.
3028796	3033986	368	E	1	I think similar to what George said on sort of it's a bird song.
3034018	3037202	369	E	0.73	I think there's different aspects know?
3037356	3037818	370	D	1	Yes.
3037904	3046038	371	E	0.99845	Generally on the technical, the physiology or the anatomy side, then the practitioner is always obviously more the expert.
3046134	3057758	372	E	1	But I think there's certain things where maybe you're looking at a patient or you're still trying to examine them and the patient is still going to be the expert in their pain.
3057844	3071954	373	E	1	And so you might be tossing and turning between a few diagnosis, say, and then the patient suddenly comes up with like, oh yeah, by the way, and then what you were thinking completely goes out.
3071992	3073960	374	E	0.99997	So I think you completely read them.
3074330	3087334	375	E	0.99998	There's always going to be sort of hidden states that you don't know about and then you're always on the lookout in case the situation is changing or maybe they don't want to tell you exactly what it is and you think something's missing.
3087382	3095846	376	E	0.99999	That intuition that maybe there's an element of this that you're not getting, or suddenly they got worse and you're wondering, well, what happened?
3095968	3097150	377	E	0.99991	What changed?
3097970	3098926	378	E	0.99995	What goes on?
3098948	3100960	379	E	0.99	And then you find out that.
3103330	3103694	380	D	0.99984	Their.
3103732	3114020	381	E	0.78286	Child'S been really sick or something, or their work has been really stressful or something else has happened, excluding that they haven't said that you kind of pick up on.
3115110	3121430	382	E	0.99986	So I think there's that where you're inferring what that other person means.
3121500	3135190	383	E	1	And there's definitely you're watching them, they're watching you, and you're kind of still deciding what's going to happen based on what you think is going on throughout treatment.
3135850	3157726	384	E	0.64665	There's no set treatment for certain things as well, whether it's exercises or touch, you have to adapt based on what you're feeling and similarly to what you ian that brought it up before, the sort of synchrony and whether it's exact or not.
3157828	3160366	385	E	0.98705	Well, it sort of also depends on the stimulus.
3160398	3183240	386	E	0.9968	There's a lot of research that there was one paper that was about a film and they got two separate people to watch the same film by themselves at separate times, but in certain parts of the film, their heart rate was exactly the same.
3184250	3190442	387	E	0.9999	Their heart rate went up when the fight scene happened and then their heart rate went down the same.
3190496	3199486	388	E	1	And actually, you know, the difference was they were in sync even though they were nowhere near each other, couldn't see each other, didn't know what that person was doing.
3199508	3204190	389	E	0.97872	They're probably doing completely different things, but the stimulus dictated the synchrony.
3204930	3219010	390	E	0.99169	So I think that's an interesting thing to consider as well, that the synchrony might be from the stimulus that's happening during the treatment, whether it's touch, whether it's something else, but we focused on touch.
3219080	3230070	391	E	0.59	But yeah, whether you synchronize just based on what you're in that moment, but actually it's completely different otherwise.
3232010	3234140	392	E	0.83	Yeah, just wanted to point that out.
3234990	3235740	393	A	0.99984	Thanks.
3236190	3248462	394	A	0.99999	That reminds me a lot of this direct interfacing mechanism of synchrony, which might be via, like auditory communication, touch and so on.
3248516	3261186	395	A	1	And then there's this more stigma, g based niche modification construction of a niche, like a corn maze where everybody walking through it is having a shared experience.
3261288	3264046	396	A	1	Or like you said, with two people watching the same film.
3264158	3268062	397	A	0.98671	It's like there's some similarity in their niche.
3268206	3280786	398	A	1	And so there's a resulting synchronization without direct interfacing because they're interacting in a shared there's something shared about their niche.
3280818	3295210	399	A	0.84002	Either two people going through the same niche at different moments, patients coming through a space, or there's people that are in separate physical spaces, but the niche has some similarity.
3296110	3299120	400	A	0.99	And I'm sure there's a lot of other examples like that.
3299810	3300506	401	A	0.98979	Ian.
3300618	3305040	402	A	1	And then I have that image up if you want to describe what you wanted to share there.
3305890	3306810	403	B	0.99919	Thanks, Daniel.
3306890	3308594	404	B	0.99	Yeah, I will describe that in a moment.
3308632	3318974	405	B	0.98	But as conversation about films, I'm just thinking that Hollywood and filmmakers are actually masters of inducing synchrony.
3319022	3319474	406	B	0.72966	Really.
3319592	3324870	407	B	0.99831	They've got the birdsong, so they've got the beautiful music or the dramatic music or whatever.
3325020	3333710	408	B	0.99965	Got the imagery, the words, the composition of the images to hopefully not obviously not everyone will have the same experience of a film.
3333730	3343386	409	B	0.54	But they hope that their sad film will induce some synchrony amongst the viewers in terms of the response in their body.
3343488	3355054	410	B	0.99834	Or a happy film will induce some kind of rhythmic and I'm thinking about some work I've heard.
3355092	3378710	411	B	1	Of recently of John Viveki looking at emotional goosebumps and how this links to he thinks the process of temperature regulation is being exacted up into some kind of relevant or bringing things salient to us through goosebumps.
3380170	3388890	412	B	1	And there's an opportunity there to kind of open up cognitively and explore some other ideas that maybe the person wasn't able to before.
3388960	3396894	413	B	1	And you can think, okay, that music gave me goosebumps, and I had all these so, yeah, there's just a few things as we were talking there that I was thinking about.
3396932	3408250	414	B	1	But this diagram was, George, as you were talking about, the kind of how the complex things that might be at play within a patient.
3408330	3412194	415	B	1	This was done by MIT, only found out about it a few days ago.
3412232	3413666	416	B	0.83	It was 2015.
3413848	3421074	417	B	0.64	But all of these different factors that might lead someone into a kind of vicious cycle of depression.
3421122	3430966	418	B	0.81	And we've got things like cortisol or unbridled inflammation at the top there.
3430988	3443158	419	B	1	But then you've also got, as you said, George, the physical inactivity and how this you've got all these different looping perception action cycles here that are creating this sort of downward spiral.
3443254	3449658	420	B	0.67	And therapeutically, I guess what we're trying to do is create an upward opening, trying to get an access point.
3449744	3454666	421	B	0.87	And Zoe, you said you might have to try lots of looking, trying one of these loops.
3454698	3467090	422	B	1	And if that doesn't work, okay, try a different loop to open up this sort of thing that's tightening and maybe open it up either physically or perceptually.
3468630	3469234	423	A	1	Yeah.
3469352	3470162	424	A	0.99999	Thank you.
3470296	3473910	425	A	0.99998	This is like very much showing that complex causation.
3474250	3488950	426	A	1	And so sometimes a disciplinary approach might be like well, hippocampal volume is associated with this change and that could absolutely be empirically true or cytokine signaling or early adverse experiences.
3489110	3495370	427	A	1	And so part of the challenge is reassembling this complex causal network.
3495810	3511070	428	A	1	And then even if there were some sort of causal network that could be reassembled, then how might the failure mode be similar or different from the recovery mode?
3511150	3525522	429	A	0.88	Like there are certain things that cannot be changed, like in the past and there's other things kind of like the concept of hysteresis where we can't just reversibly modify something.
3525656	3530210	430	A	0.99	And so where are the leverage points in this diagram?
3530630	3534220	431	A	0.94	And it's yeah, George, it.
3537160	3543204	432	C	0.51	Yeah, it's pretty complex, but yeah, very good diagram for sure.
3543242	3558970	433	C	1	And I think there's a lot of stuff that we are talking about that's clearly there I think clearly we have modifiable and non modifiable things.
3560400	3567916	434	C	0.52851	There's stuff we can't change someone else's genetics, we can't change what happened in the past, okay?
3568098	3597220	435	C	1	But they are modifiable things that at least in the context of musculoskeletal care are present that can include beliefs, their priors about their ideas about pain, what's wrong with them and so on down to things that could be lifestyle and lifestyle could be more movement, kind of changing the diet or whatever.
3597370	3605960	436	C	0.99994	Stop smoking, kind of engaging in something that starts getting them kind of start getting their sense making back.
3606030	3606650	437	C	0.99765	Okay.
3608700	3610776	438	C	0.98598	Through the sense, the ideas.
3610808	3618300	439	C	0.47	And actually the other interesting thing about this stuff where are the opportunities?
3620800	3624610	440	C	0.99995	How can we start that process of change?
3625300	3638180	441	C	0.8	A very nice model, typically aligned more with an activist approach now sort of finding ways into pain and so on, are the ecological psychology ideas about affordances.
3639960	3642580	442	C	0.99998	What is out there in the environment?
3643080	3648776	443	C	0.99995	Already linked some authors to kind of the active inference, predictive processing and so on.
3648878	3676704	444	C	1	But clearly one can think about the world provides us with a landscape of affordances stuff that kind of are opportunities for action, which is basically what the description of an affordance is and one that lives in a very nice environment, for example, with a beautiful park and can walk along the coastline and stress free environment and so on.
3676742	3683728	445	C	0.99995	Clearly that world, it's a world for the sort of beautiful kind of lifestyle and so on, right?
3683814	3693696	446	C	0.99919	Whereas if one lives in an urban jungle and everybody's super stressed outside and so on, arguably that landscape kind of is much smaller.
3693728	3702264	447	C	1	And when we say, yeah, would be good for you to start walking, for example, that would be a good way of start managing your back pain.
3702382	3706324	448	C	0.77	The patient can say, yeah, but when I get out of the house, I'm struggling.
3706372	3710188	449	C	1	I might just get run over by a car straight away.
3710354	3712648	450	C	1	The environment outside is awful.
3712744	3714296	451	C	0.98065	There's pollution everywhere.
3714488	3716030	452	C	0.99992	What do you want me to do?
3718400	3719948	453	C	0.99963	I'm scared of going outside.
3720034	3721804	454	C	0.99981	So, no, thank you very much.
3721922	3733520	455	C	0.65	But of course, if you are on the other side of the spectrum, you can invite the person and use what's out there and start playing a little bit with those opportunities for action.
3734900	3747268	456	C	1	I think those are tools that if we think sometimes we can start thinking very hard about what sort of exercises should the patient do, should the person get engaged and so on.
3747434	3765388	457	C	1	And if we think much in much simpler terms and think about what's outside, what's out there, what kind of things are already in the environment that can be used to actually promote change, we would be surprised that actually just a flight of stairs would be good enough.
3765474	3766440	458	C	0.99989	Don't take the lift.
3766520	3774320	459	C	0.6082	Take the stairs and start sort of walking a little bit back and forth from home to work and so on.
3774390	3779664	460	C	0.78333	Those minimal things, if the person feels like, yeah, okay, I'll have a go, and I'll try that.
3779862	3790244	461	C	0.7972	Clearly we are in that process of kind of changing a little bit of their sort of internal state.
3790442	3796672	462	C	0.97766	Maybe that prior about, yeah, I can't move, I can't lift, because it will damage my back.
3796746	3802410	463	C	0.50367	In fact, when they start trusting their bodies, they can do a little bit more.
3804780	3807992	464	C	0.62417	It's always hard to think about, okay, how can I change this?
3808046	3811020	465	C	0.99997	How can I change the generative model?
3811090	3819384	466	C	1	And we almost think everything needs to be conscious, cognitive and so on, when in fact, a lot of stuff happens unconsciously.
3819432	3820030	467	C	0.73539	Right?
3822080	3829756	468	C	1	If it was always about, I'm going to think about changing and I'm going to do this, then the world would be much simpler.
3829788	3829984	469	C	0.99991	Right.
3830022	3836470	470	C	1	But a lot of stuff is hidden anyway, and even the person is not aware of that stuff.
3838760	3848804	471	C	0.98491	So the change, the process, the tools and so on, that goes back to that very good diagram with all these factors.
3848852	3851416	472	C	1	And I think as a practitioner, yes, okay.
3851518	3868572	473	C	1	I can focus entirely on the brain and the neuroscience of it and become like a brain centric approach, or I can start thinking about actually the brain is it's the hardware kind of stuff, but there's much more in it and much more in it.
3868706	3872784	474	C	0.99867	Takes the person, takes the environment, takes the kind of opportunities and so on.
3872822	3875010	475	C	0.99	The stuff out there can be used.
3876100	3877100	476	A	0.99939	Thank you, George.
3877180	3878000	477	A	0.98136	Zoe?
3880580	3880992	478	D	1	Yeah.
3881046	3897552	479	E	0.99991	Just going off of what George said in terms of the environment around it, like when you're sort of maybe if you're surrounded by nature or things like that, then you might be sort of more willing or more able to change your priors.
3897616	3903412	480	E	0.96	I think it's also important to realize, especially through touch, that it's one modality.
3903476	3903704	481	D	0.99992	Right.
3903742	3920716	482	E	0.99987	It's one way in which we're starting to kind of try to understand and try to manipulate the process of sort of changing those memories, whether it's the way it's processed or just having initially or just trying to adapt it.
3920738	3923760	483	E	1	And that's that touch is one way.
3923830	3938400	484	E	1	But I think also it's interesting that it's probably more likely that we may not be able to completely change that sort of prior, but we might in that context.
3938560	3953444	485	E	0.536	So we might not change the fact that it's painful to bend down, but we might be able to, through touch and through sort of treatment, get the patient to realize, okay, well, yes, maybe bending forwards is dangerous.
3953492	3955160	486	E	0.7	It is a bad thing.
3955310	3962028	487	E	1	But if you do it in a certain way and you look at it in this way, then actually it's not so bad.
3962194	3968156	488	E	0.82113	So I think it's important to take the context into it.
3968178	3984432	489	E	0.95	I think with this, I think we might be able to maybe not completely change the maladaptive belief, but with touch we can try to change it so that it's more context specific rather than a general belief that isn't able to change.
3984486	3985636	490	E	0.99998	We might be able to change it.
3985658	3997830	491	E	0.99947	So in certain circumstances, whether it's the way we do things or just the way that we approach things, we might be able to update it or modify it for that specific thing.
3999400	4004068	492	E	0.89	I know that papers were talking about it in terms of like being scared of spiders.
4004244	4017116	493	E	0.97	You might still be scared of spiders, but if you know that you're scared of spiders and they've got food nearby and the spider is happy, then maybe, yeah, the spider is still scary, but it's not likely to kill you or something like that.
4017138	4023232	494	E	0.99986	In this circumstance, it's not as bad as it could be and you're going to be safe from whatever sort of fear it is.
4023286	4030396	495	E	0.95562	So I think that's an important thing to add on from what George was saying, and I'll pass it back to George.
4030588	4031404	496	A	0.99	Yes, George.
4031452	4032210	497	A	0.51	And then.
4035640	4038550	498	C	0.85168	Know what Zoe just said.
4040760	4042068	499	C	0.95813	It's quite important.
4042154	4049930	500	C	0.82	And through touch we can clearly get in kind of affect, understand and so on.
4050620	4054730	501	C	1	I think that's all the positive stuff about touch.
4055180	4068060	502	C	0.9866	There's another factor, another side of the equation which I think as practitioners we need to be aware of, which is the power of what's the hidden state and that touch can trigger.
4068560	4074188	503	C	1	And particularly in trauma situations, memories are embodied.
4074284	4082608	504	C	1	And when you touch someone in a particular part of the body, that might again bring that unconscious stuff about.
4082694	4099704	505	C	1	For example, someone has been victim of sexual abuse for example and you could touch a person and straight away either there is a sort of a massive response fight or flight what's going on here?
4099902	4112264	506	C	0.99958	Or if it is about this sort of hidden state you might actually find that that touch kind of created a response that is almost like a no go zone.
4112312	4117528	507	C	1	And you kind of need to be aware that sometimes you touch people that don't like being touched.
4117704	4129170	508	C	0.59437	Someone goes to a clinician that in an intervention is primarily touch based, doesn't like being touched, it might go well, it might synchronize extremely well.
4129620	4132496	509	C	0.98562	They understand you, they talk when you start, say, okay, let's have a look.
4132518	4137776	510	C	0.92469	Let's palpate that you can feel like there's a fight or flight kind of mode.
4137808	4139572	511	C	1	The person goes in straight away.
4139706	4157032	512	C	0.9956	So I think understanding this is also quite important in understanding the limits of competence of someone in Musculoskeletal care, for example, that that's an area that where probably the person needs to be referred to someone else, an expert in the area.
4157166	4162444	513	C	0.89541	Maybe by getting a sense of there's a response here.
4162482	4168828	514	C	0.99829	That's not the one I would expect to perhaps not then to open the Pandora box.
4168994	4182112	515	C	0.59	Oh, tell me a little bit about what's going on here because again, you pressed on a button that keep the lid on kind of thing.
4182166	4183650	516	C	0.98193	Don't open it, please.
4185080	4187940	517	C	0.99998	This is important, I think, both ways.
4188090	4200936	518	C	0.74719	It's kind of the power as a therapeutic tool, but also the power of triggering responses that actually are quite important to take into account.
4201038	4222324	519	C	1	And in fact, the paper we got accepted yesterday, which is the continuation of this in musculoskeletal care, one of the reviewers actually wanted us to say there are psychologists, psychotherapy treat people, that memories are embodied and you need to be aware of avoiding overlaps.
4222392	4222960	520	C	0.99476	Okay?
4223110	4237888	521	C	0.99998	So that means don't jump into an area that you don't know about, but be aware that sometimes you're getting that response pretty much you're getting into someone hidden state stuff that is there in the background.
4238064	4239812	522	C	0.54145	Just leave it alone, please.
4239946	4253290	523	C	0.50002	That's the way at least I see the world around me is like don't sort of start the process that you don't want to or if you don't, if you do, then go and see someone.
4256940	4257924	524	A	0.49671	Or sorry, Ian.
4257972	4258920	525	A	1	And then blue.
4263180	4263896	526	B	0.99	Oh, it's okay.
4263918	4264904	527	B	1	I didn't have my hand up.
4264942	4266052	528	B	0.99659	So over to blue.
4266196	4267790	529	A	0.45904	OK, blue, go for it.
4268800	4282608	530	F	0.99909	So it's interesting, and I don't know if in your work as an osteopath, but there's many layers I found through working emotionally, physically on myself through my life.
4282694	4284368	531	F	0.99997	It's like peeling an onion, right?
4284454	4294404	532	F	1	And so as you go through, it's interesting that all this stuff resurfaces and even physical trauma remains there.
4294442	4295776	533	F	1	Like you stub your pinky toe.
4295808	4300548	534	F	1	You stub your pinky toe 25 times, 35 times, 255 times, who knows how many times, right?
4300554	4302072	535	F	0.78	It depends on how clumsy you are.
4302206	4304840	536	F	1	But your pinky toe remembers being stubbed.
4305180	4313390	537	F	1	It has maybe like a hyper response because it's been stubbed so many times, because it's whatever that's its little job in life is to be stubbed, I think.
4314320	4322716	538	F	0.8	But it's interesting that you kind of have to open it up to do the work.
4322818	4326688	539	F	1	And I wonder what kind of synchronous work there is.
4326854	4339232	540	F	1	I know that there are some people that deal with physical and emotional trauma and I know physical trauma can be a manifestation of emotional trauma and you can have emotional trauma based on your physical trauma.
4339296	4355412	541	F	0.99999	So again, it's like this bi directional circular loop and I wonder what the training is in osteopathy to deal with emotional trauma that may come up or what kind of are there people that do integrative practices?
4355476	4361320	542	F	0.94	Like you have to be an osteopath and then maybe you do your residency as a psychiatrist?
4363360	4369820	543	F	0.99969	Can you get it all out if you have some kind of linked problem that's both physical and emotional?
4371520	4373192	544	A	0.99455	Thank you, George.
4373256	4374220	545	A	0.87772	Then Ian.
4375380	4406008	546	C	0.99654	Okay, so the model in terms of therapeutic alliance and synchrony and using touch if we use to the whole world of healthcare practice could argue that in a world of psychotherapy for example mind body kind of stuff the person would be sort of equipped with the tools to explore, to enable them to open up, to start the process.
4406174	4417672	547	C	1	And being able to deal with that the paper as a kind of a generic kind of model that could apply as an umbrella to a number of areas of practice.
4417816	4420172	548	C	1	For sure, we can do that and no problem.
4420306	4431676	549	C	0.99999	If we think specifically about manual therapy and specifically about osteopathy, then you've got two worlds, the American world of osteopathic medicine, where osteopathic medicine is medicine.
4431788	4440036	550	C	0.85	And there are osteopaths in the US who are psychiatrists as well.
4440138	4463368	551	C	0.99	And in that case, yes, that person would be ideally suited to be able to explore that, to do that, to kind of start that process of care, actually using both their competences as a psychiatrist and their competences as also manual therapist as a hands on kind of a practitioner.
4463544	4474544	552	C	0.99999	In other countries, osteopaths are primarily kind of manual therapists, if you want to call it that way.
4474582	4483612	553	C	0.99628	Although osteopaths don't like being called manual therapists, but primarily use manual therapy primarily in musculoskeletal care, but other areas of practice.
4483756	4495104	554	C	1	And we start seeing a number of practitioners going down the route of like physiotherapists using what is called a psychologically informed type of practice.
4495232	4505252	555	C	1	And that typically involves some additional training in counseling or some additional training in some CBT like kind of approaches.
4505316	4511916	556	C	1	Like, for example, something like acceptance and commitment therapy, for example.
4512018	4523636	557	C	0.55798	So stuff that actually combined with hands on potentiates the effect of the treatment that the hands on alone would not achieve.
4523688	4535520	558	C	1	But when you come from the two kind of two different angles meeting in the middle and providing a more robust package of care you can get better results.
4535960	4559412	559	C	0.99965	Because the training as a preregistration level is very basic to enable you to recognize that there are things that need a referral to another practitioner even those that practice a psychologically informed type of practice.
4559476	4571884	560	C	1	Like several physiotherapists have developed a kind of a traffic light system where clearly there are stuff on the yellow that anxiety is associated with pain and so on.
4571922	4574044	561	C	0.99998	That's okay, you can deal with that.
4574162	4580444	562	C	0.56576	There's some stuff kind of in the orange that you have to be a little bit careful.
4580492	4589308	563	C	1	And there are clearly stuff PTSDs and so on, where it's a no go zone because you can dive in.
4589334	4592868	564	C	1	And then you don't know if you're going to come back okay kind of thing.
4593034	4596288	565	C	0.99996	So that is typically a referral to another practitioner.
4596384	4610520	566	C	1	Having said that, I think there are opportunities for collaborative work where the two together can actually provide a much better service to a person that's simply relying on one practitioner that can do everything.
4610590	4628640	567	C	0.74	I think that sometimes exploring stuff through the physical body, the embodied self opens the doors for stuff to be explored at other elements of the self when the body is a little bit more prepared to deal with stuff and people maybe are prepared to talk.
4628790	4634210	568	C	0.99999	Sometimes you see that in cases of childhood abuse and so on.
4634900	4645136	569	C	0.99997	Kind of had some stuff that felt good, some hands on work, even the massage and the person felt a bit more confident in themselves and they were prepared then let's have a chat.
4645248	4654072	570	C	0.77	And they were not prepared to sort of go to talking therapy straight away because there was too much going on in there.
4654126	4655610	571	C	0.99283	Kind of invited itself.
4657340	4660730	572	A	1	The sirens go off when certain things happen.
4661520	4662270	573	C	0.94797	Exactly.
4662720	4663580	574	A	0.62161	Ian.
4666320	4666732	575	B	0.71	Yes.
4666786	4701016	576	B	0.97745	So just sort of picking up on the points from George and the question from yeah really totally agree that it's not the job of an untrained manual therapist to kind of aim to open a can of worms of something that especially if it's not five minutes before the end of a session, and then you kind of say, okay, I want to see you later, see you next week, and got another client now, and that's definitely not a good idea.
4701198	4708330	577	B	0.99992	However, as you said, George, sometimes people will come and they'll want to offer things and they'll want to talk about stuff.
4710380	4716520	578	B	0.99	And what I was thinking about Blue as you were asking about sort of the different combinations of approaches.
4716600	4726380	579	B	1	I don't know if George and Zoe or any of you are familiar with David Bocelli's work on tre trauma release or tension release.
4729360	4731776	580	B	0.89	You know, he doesn't really go into the story.
4731878	4737492	581	B	0.99992	So it's not kind of psychoanalytical or unraveling the stories of people's past.
4737546	4745936	582	B	1	But he has methods for inducing kind of what I think is myofascial and what it looks like myofascial unwinding.
4745968	4777810	583	B	0.99908	So sometimes it's tremoring and so it's sort of I don't think he necessarily uses touch in the beginning, but I guess what I'm thinking is that there are ways that if the ways of offering clients opportunities to unravel the bodily trapped or the stuff that's held in the body where they don't have to verbalize it if they don't want to.
4778180	4788656	584	B	1	But the inroad is to induce some kind of letting go, which maybe is what all manual therapy is about, to a greater or lesser degree.
4788688	4791296	585	B	1	But his examples are quite dramatic.
4791408	4798564	586	B	0.99999	People will be making big movements that seemingly are uncontrolled but if you ask them to stop at any time, they can stop.
4798682	4800260	587	B	0.99995	They can bring it into voluntary.
4800340	4805770	588	B	1	But there seems to be a really big updating of some generative model through this process.
4809020	4811240	589	B	1	Yeah, they're my thoughts.
4812560	4813550	590	A	0.99998	Thank you.
4814640	4819240	591	A	0.97646	I'm going to return to our previous complex causation network.
4819320	4834844	592	A	0.99964	Now, it's smaller because we're abstracting away from the details and think about, like, what are some active inference questions that come to mind and how could we look at this differently than, for example, just a structural equation model that's fit from many empirical studies?
4834972	4838592	593	A	1	And so here's Figure 4.3 from the textbook.
4838736	4842996	594	A	1	And this is a partially observable Markov decision process.
4843178	4848432	595	A	1	And it's come up in other papers and live streams, so we won't go into too much details.
4848576	4857416	596	A	1	But the kinds of things that we might want to ask are, like, what variables are latent states or observable in general?
4857518	4867064	597	A	1	And then in the specific case, for example, maybe there's a total, absolutely perfect association between hippocampus volume and some other clinical outcome.
4867192	4870792	598	A	1	And so hippocampus volume conceptually is observable.
4870856	4872168	599	A	1	It could be observed.
4872264	4878050	600	A	0.55	But in that exact patient's case, it may not be an observable in that relationship.
4878580	4884396	601	A	0.99932	So variables can be observable in one context and latent in another context.
4884508	4895444	602	A	0.99996	So that might speak to evidence based grounding where like, okay, we don't know what somebody's blood level of this is, what's the most informative thing to do?
4895562	4897348	603	A	0.99999	Maybe we can measure it.
4897434	4901716	604	A	1	And then that ties their measurements into other observables.
4901748	4902760	605	A	0.99974	So that's one question.
4902830	4905880	606	A	1	What are observables and what are latent variables?
4906460	4909624	607	A	0.99999	What variables do we have causal influence on?
4909742	4916828	608	A	0.99998	What affordances exist that might have intervening influence on some unobserved state?
4916914	4923470	609	A	0.66114	So here's, like, pi the policy selection and then the way that the hidden state is changing through time.
4924240	4926480	610	A	0.99997	That's what the affordances are about.
4926550	4930048	611	A	0.79181	Influencing the hidden state is the true temperature of the room.
4930134	4932528	612	A	1	The thermometer is the observed value.
4932694	4942884	613	A	1	And then taking an action like turning on the air conditioning is about intervening in the hidden state such that other observables are seen.
4943082	4949384	614	A	1	And then we talked also about like, in what ways can we change the generative model?
4949502	4953400	615	A	0.99978	So here's the policy selection of the practitioner.
4953980	4961080	616	A	1	And then in the interface, it's like, it's meeting with the observations of the patient.
4961660	4967160	617	A	1	The actions of the practitioner, what they say and what they do are received as observations.
4967240	4970732	618	A	1	And that's kind of this dyad active that we've seen.
4970786	4990884	619	A	0.99995	So rather than the one entity navigating and sense making in the world, the joint sense making features, this interface where the policy selections on one and their thinking through other minds, their inference on the generative model of the other is what is being intervened in.
4991082	4994784	620	A	0.99999	How can we change the generative model, the cognitive models?
4994912	4996950	621	A	0.70639	How can we change the generative process?
4997320	5011480	622	A	0.99999	Could there be something welcoming on the door of the room that is a modification of the niche or some other design choice that helps scaffold this therapeutic niche?
5012080	5026370	623	A	1	And yeah, what policies can be taken from the toolkit that is afforded in that moment based upon the training and the equipment available and so on, that influence what to result in what.
5027460	5031730	624	A	1	And that kind of comes back to this synchrony for what question?
5032420	5054948	625	A	0.99999	Just achieving synchrony is like a sort of undirected hypnosis or undirected sort of I don't know, it's just sort of like this vegetative propagation of coordination that would only coincidentally be functional.
5055124	5063196	626	A	0.93369	So having a functional outcome in mind, then there can be a working backwards, like well, what observations are we looking for?
5063378	5066472	627	A	1	And then what hidden states give rise to those observations?
5066616	5076620	628	A	0.65	And what policies exist that intervene in those hidden states and in the dynamics of how they change, recognizing their complexity?
5076780	5087060	629	A	0.9999	So those would just be a few active inference variables and approaches that are being invoked here conversationally.
5088040	5096950	630	A	0.9999	However, the kinds of models and the empirical data to take it further are being sketched out.
5100060	5105140	631	A	0.99828	Well, it's going very fast and we're in kind of the home stretch.
5105220	5110170	632	A	0.99995	So what would anyone like to look at or turn to?
5110700	5119710	633	A	0.63301	We have a few other questions that previously had been raised that we didn't perhaps get to.
5120080	5126764	634	A	0.99999	Some of them are written here, so anything that people see here that they're interested in or any other topic.
5126892	5131244	635	A	1	And then also just how are we coming out of this dot?
5131292	5139712	636	A	0.49	Two what will be different in our action as we are engaged in this area, of course, from many different perspectives.
5139776	5140580	637	A	0.99943	George.
5143800	5150888	638	C	1	I loved your kind of proposal, your summary of all those active inference questions.
5150974	5154330	639	C	0.88568	In fact, there's a structure for paper in it, right?
5157260	5161870	640	C	1	It can take us down the road, even just sort of looking at some computational stuff.
5162560	5166060	641	C	0.99015	So creating some kind of a framework.
5167200	5170430	642	C	0.77	Yeah, so I very much like it.
5171520	5181056	643	C	1	I think there is a sort of challenge and what are the latents and observables and so on to define those kind of things?
5181078	5182770	644	C	0.50735	That needs a little bit of thinking.
5185460	5194550	645	C	1	The other stuff, I think, as you said, probably working backwards would sort of becomes easier, isn't it?
5195560	5201156	646	C	0.88	It is about hands on with reassurance and so on.
5201258	5210884	647	C	0.99997	If that's sort of what the policy and so on and what we observed back at the beginning, I think it would be fascinating.
5210932	5225090	648	C	1	I think in terms of the bio behavioral kind of element of synchrony, there's clearly changes in breathing, changes in probably heart rate variability and so on.
5226900	5230256	649	C	0.99999	That would be interesting to understand.
5230438	5237650	650	C	1	Is that a sign that the system is sort of starting, changing the process?
5238660	5243670	651	C	0.29	It talked about the thing, maybe something in the door of the room.
5245080	5256472	652	C	0.92	A couple of years ago when I was practicing in another country for quite a few months, I used to use a lot of classical music and opera and so on.
5256606	5267340	653	C	1	And that was actually a tremendously effective way of creating an environment where the person sort of actually a form of inducing that synchrony.
5269280	5271324	654	C	0.96204	I'm treating I'm kind of doing this stuff.
5271362	5272572	655	C	1	I don't need to talk that much.
5272626	5276544	656	C	0.82839	I'm kind of just go with the sensations, go with the music.
5276662	5282850	657	C	0.84	And I felt that actually that was a very good way as a process of start changing the generative model.
5284820	5294580	658	C	0.99366	So there is the stuff, as we kind of proposed on one of the recent papers, the stuff that you can implement.
5295160	5309144	659	C	0.99997	So if you doing the Tactile, the touch based intervention and use forms of language sometimes to get the person to visualize what you're doing, for example, I'm doing this and I'm trying to achieve that.
5309182	5323244	660	C	1	And you know that the person is even, like, interceptively robust enough to let you explore the inner sensations to situations as you're probably doing some work.
5323282	5337552	661	C	1	And you realize by sort of predicting their internal states that they're just focusing too much and giving too much attention to stuff which is actually not useful, where you can just say, oh, you know what?
5337686	5341060	662	C	0.59	Like we said in the paper, I have a new dog.
5341210	5343844	663	C	0.95	And where does the dog come from?
5343962	5361332	664	C	0.77	But a dog in that sense is a way of sort of breaking down that attention to what you're doing to sort of say oh, okay, so you're continuing, there's still the sensory stimulation, there is still that sensory evidence arriving to the system.
5361406	5376752	665	C	1	But actually you start changing a little bit, you're flattening a little bit of the sensory state by sort of zeroing things and then maybe those sensations that come in potentially kind of change some stuff.
5376806	5382976	666	C	0.61313	So yeah, I think at this level that's for sure some stuff to do.
5383078	5408564	667	C	1	I think it's an interesting thing that actually started being explored now with Ted Kapchuk lab in Harvard around Acupuncture, which know looking at synchrony as well with hyperscanning techniques and kind of finding that actually successful in terms of the intervention is associated again, what synchrony.
5408692	5415870	668	C	0.99684	So kind of a body of evidence sort of building up, I think quite nice.
5419200	5430636	669	A	1	One thought on the free energy minimizing and ML Don and several others were discussing in the chat about our biological systems truly finding global minima.
5430668	5453992	670	A	0.53	And so it's a big question, but just to give one thought on it is the free energy is calculated for a given policy sequence of actions in terms of how informative that sequence of actions is expected to be and how useful that sequence of action is supposed to be expected to be.
5454126	5464604	671	A	0.97	And so different action pathways are evaluated based upon their ability to reduce uncertainty or provide direct value.
5464802	5486996	672	A	0.99	And so if we can just maybe there's multiple things that have value in the therapeutic alliance, but one for the generative model of the practitioner might be like to reduce a number on a pain survey that would be useful and then there might be multiple policies and maybe adequacy is good enough.
5487178	5508372	673	A	1	And if the pathways are to some balance or shifting balance of informative and useful, either reducing pain or helping understand how to reduce pain, then navigating and shifting policies is something that can be done adaptively.
5508436	5519630	674	A	1	And then in contrast, the policies that might want to be disfavored would be like the ones that are adding confusion, reducing clarity of sense making or increasing pain.
5520560	5542784	675	A	1	And that's not to say that there's not moments where transiently surprise does increase or pain does increase, but that is part of a policy like, I'm going to touch this place, that might transiently increase pain, but that might be an informative action that in an extended timeline is part of a free energy minimizing trajectory.
5542912	5546244	676	A	0.99	And so what is the horizon and so on.
5546362	5548390	677	A	0.71164	George and then anyone else?
5552140	5556260	678	C	0.93477	That thing sort of modifying pain, modifying symptoms.
5556420	5563980	679	C	0.99955	It's quite an interesting thing because for example, at least in my profession, there's this idea that we don't treat the symptoms, we treat the cause of the problem.
5564050	5568110	680	C	0.98208	Okay, so pain is just the symptoms, nothing to worry about.
5570080	5578032	681	C	1	But from this perspective, actually changing symptoms, reducing symptoms is actually an important thing, quite an important thing.
5578086	5581324	682	C	0.99823	Particularly if you're thinking about chronic conditions.
5581372	5590070	683	C	0.99999	If you start making the person start feeling a little bit better, then you probably start changing the whole process.
5590680	5596132	684	C	0.99997	If you don't change anything, how is the person going to engage in that?
5596186	5606696	685	C	0.99528	If actually you can continue saying you're moving much better, your function is so much better, but actually the person says, you know what, but pine hasn't reduced at all.
5606718	5607880	686	C	0.99996	I'm still in agony.
5608460	5617150	687	C	0.99	I think going a little bit with small things at that level are quite important in the greater scheme of things in terms of changing the generative model.
5618400	5625036	688	C	0.99987	So it is clearly a fundamental bit of the jigsaw.
5625148	5636432	689	C	1	And it's the same as you said, informing, for example, this might be uncomfortable, but in fact is important in kind of achieving something.
5636566	5642740	690	C	0.99978	So the same way some patients tell you it is painful, but it's a good pain.
5642890	5650890	691	C	0.97727	So again, what's the value of the good pain is, the reward is a sort of anticipation that this will lead to a positive change.
5652220	5652840	692	A	0.99987	Thank you.
5652910	5653720	693	A	0.93945	Zoe?
5657260	5663032	694	E	1	Yeah, I think George just kind of touched upon what I was going to know.
5663086	5668872	695	E	0.99862	Sometimes patients I know, I have patients that come to a session and they expect it to be painful.
5669016	5682736	696	E	0.99	I mean, a lot of people expect that at some point they might get that sort of, quote, good pain where they almost want to feel like something's happening.
5682838	5689328	697	E	1	And whether that feedback is kind of pain or something, that's kind of reassuring.
5689424	5700468	698	E	1	I know patients, especially with sort of osteopathic, manipulative sort of treatment, they want the click.
5700634	5705688	699	E	1	If someone manipulates them, they come in and go, oh, I just want you to click me.
5705854	5713870	700	E	0.64	And, you know, the research shows that not necessarily you need that sound, but that feedback that they sort of want.
5714320	5730210	701	E	0.98812	They kind of want some people, they expect if you do a hard, sort of a more firm massage, they feel like they're, I don't know, getting their money's worth or they're getting more sort of treatment than if they want.
5730980	5737044	702	E	0.99995	They kind of want that feedback to say, yeah, you're in the right place, and I get that a lot.
5737082	5739876	703	E	0.99306	So I think pain is an interesting one.
5739898	5756824	704	E	0.76	I think the biosynchrony that we get and we go upon, whether it is the patient's heart rate, their breathing changes, you see their facial expression changes or the muscle tightens up nearby, you kind of go on that.
5757022	5760852	705	E	0.72	And I think it's what they expect to get from treatment.
5760916	5765500	706	E	0.99997	Not every patient is going to come in and go, yeah, I want to be in less pain.
5765570	5768056	707	E	0.99997	That might not be their ultimate goal.
5768088	5781584	708	E	0.99992	Obviously they're not going to say no to it, but they might really just want to be able to pick their kid up or go to sleep with just being able to go to sleep, not being in pain or not waking up or something like that.
5781622	5790032	709	E	0.99968	So I think it's not yes, we can clinically, it's not so simple as something that we can measure imperatively.
5790096	5806024	710	E	1	It might be something that a goal to that patient is more important than if their pain is less or if they're moving better or oh, well, yeah, if we had the technology to say, look.
5806062	5806824	711	E	1	Oh, look, your heart.
5806862	5807640	712	E	0.99998	Rate is lower.
5807710	5809796	713	E	0.99997	Or this means that you're more efficient.
5809908	5814428	714	E	0.98268	You're saving free energy because you're not expending on your pain.
5814514	5818956	715	E	0.99987	Or you're more efficient, so you'll have more energy to do this.
5818978	5821900	716	E	0.99998	Now that you're doing this better, they may not care.
5822050	5826608	717	E	0.99999	They may just want to be able to pick their kid up and not be in pain.
5826774	5839176	718	E	0.98744	So I think what we're measuring, I think, will be very individual to the patient and it might not be something that is necessarily useful in terms of research that we can quantify.
5839308	5843940	719	E	0.58	It just might be that goal that's not always sort of empirical.
5845560	5846768	720	A	0.99364	Thank you, Zoe.
5846944	5847780	721	E	0.6764	Ian.
5851980	5852824	722	B	0.80129	Thanks.
5853022	5853832	723	B	0.61915	Thanks, all.
5853886	5862412	724	B	0.96	And, yeah, just as you were saying that, Zoe, you said at the beginning, I think the intention behind it all is to help them.
5862546	5871116	725	B	1	And I'm just thinking of a scenario or some scenarios of when agreeing on the goals is so important.
5871218	5874044	726	B	0.99994	So I'm thinking short term goals and long term goals here.
5874082	5891268	727	B	0.99977	So clients who are maybe endurance runners, and they want to do six ultramarathons a year and they come to you because their calves are hurting, so your immediate goal is to reduce the pain in their calves so they can make the ultramarathon at the end of the month.
5891434	5913780	728	B	1	But then if I'm aware as a therapist that there's a link between endurance running and developing arrhythmias, heart arrhythmias, for example, and I see this person is very anxious about their goals to the point where it's almost like they need it rather than it's a pleasure.
5913940	5920844	729	B	0.55977	As such, then if I disagree with their goal, are we am I true?
5920882	5925392	730	B	0.81	You know, and saying, actually, maybe four ultramarathons a year would be enough for you.
5925526	5932720	731	B	1	Am I just enabling this drive by relieving your calf pain in the short term?
5933060	5949380	732	B	0.99753	So I think agreeing on those more broader life goals or referring to someone else if I don't agree with that, that's more of an ethical issue.
5949530	5951850	733	B	1	But it came to mind as we were talking there.
5952460	5974610	734	A	1	Yeah, that reminds me of the kind of performances that we might see in the Olympics or the medical care that might happen on the sideline of a game where somebody has been injured, but they're going to continue doing it almost in a way that is rapidly degrading potentially the future weeks of their health.
5974980	5979484	735	A	1	And then that's the ethical challenge or the decision making challenge.
5979532	5986496	736	A	0.98	Like is it worth them to hobble across the finish line with an injury?
5986528	5999432	737	A	0.99971	That every step is just deteriorating the injury, but then being consistent with a belief that one is a finisher or even a signal to those who are watching.
5999486	6003290	738	A	0.97786	There's so many complex phenomena at that level.
6004460	6008090	739	A	0.99999	Those are very interesting questions.
6009660	6010264	740	A	0.99947	Wow.
6010382	6019640	741	A	0.99364	So we're towards the end here, I guess for the authors and for anyone else, we can give some of our last thoughts.
6019720	6026930	742	A	0.99977	What are some of your next directions for this line of research and application?
6031380	6045072	743	C	0.99859	Okay, well, first of all, as last time was a fascinating discussion, think kind of learning a lot from this kind of interaction.
6045216	6046070	744	C	0.99888	For sure.
6048200	6057848	745	C	0.99977	Within this we sort of got some stuff done published in the musculoskeletal side of things.
6057934	6066200	746	C	0.99957	We have another paper to be submitted very soon, the next week or so, the same topic, but in pediatrics.
6066280	6068910	747	C	1	And there's the bulk of the other stuff building up.
6069440	6096100	748	C	1	I think what we want to achieve now is to start testing some of these ideas kind of empirically using different methods from qualitative kind of phenomenological type of approaches, trying to understand really what's going on to more sort of NeuroBio stuff.
6096250	6114940	749	C	0.99997	Kind of along the lines of looking at for example, some markers of bio behavioral synchrony like for example, physiological changes in both the practitioner and the patient.
6115280	6117470	750	C	0.99808	Bearing in mind some of this stuff.
6119120	6132320	751	C	1	It is a bit more challenging to achieve because whereas for example, in the field of psychotherapy, the person practitioner is typically sitting down, the guy doing manual therapy is moving around.
6132390	6147156	752	C	0.99999	So therefore the heart rate is not going to be exactly the same but looking at what can be done and creating some models as well.
6147178	6156280	753	C	0.99917	So the idea around computational stuff also makes sense to test some of the ideas.
6157100	6158984	754	C	0.99999	This is work that is building up.
6159022	6172110	755	C	0.99968	So we very much look forward to kind of people getting in touch, bouncing off ideas from each other, kind of looking at how we can move forward with this.
6173040	6177344	756	C	0.99867	It's not osteopathic specific is more than that.
6177382	6187280	757	C	0.96	I think at least it can be manual therapy more broadening along those lines.
6188020	6200824	758	C	0.7	You can look at sort of the role of some of this stuff in chronic conditions, not just pain, but other persistent physical symptoms and so on.
6200862	6202376	759	C	0.98836	So that's where we are.
6202478	6209560	760	C	0.93336	It's time now to start kind of testing some of this stuff for sure and stop writing theoretical papers.
6212160	6212910	761	C	0.74711	Cool.
6214000	6214940	762	A	0.91195	Zoe?
6218480	6222110	763	E	1	Yeah, sort of what George said.
6226180	6235344	764	E	0.99236	We've had one paper accepted for MSK, so hopefully that will come out for everyone to read soon.
6235542	6236572	765	A	0.90467	What is MSK.
6236636	6263820	766	E	0.90567	We've got one waiting, so for more orthopedic general musculoskeletal muscle muscle and bones kind of patients and then the pediatrics one is almost ready to submit.
6264800	6279312	767	E	1	And then, yeah, I guess we'll be looking towards seeing where it goes and what we can sort of empirically prove from all the theories that are kind of circulating and going from there.
6279366	6285744	768	E	1	But hopefully discussions like what everyone said now will give everyone more ideas to.
6285782	6286610	769	D	0.9985	Sort of.
6288440	6299030	770	E	0.69505	Where we're going or where we could go, and different ways to apply the principles and the frameworks that we've suggested so far.
6300300	6301000	771	A	0.84804	Awesome.
6301150	6301960	772	A	0.89771	George?
6302540	6302952	773	C	0.97	Yeah.
6303006	6314700	774	C	0.8342	Just on the pediatrics, we actually have one of the first lines to start exploring is synchrony between mother, baby and practitioner.
6315680	6327756	775	C	0.9957	Starting with not sure if you're going to we've been doing a bit of work around the effect of touch on premature babies.
6327948	6333744	776	C	0.90036	So we have those collaborations with hospitals in Italy would enable us to do some of that stuff.
6333862	6365804	777	C	0.46	But we sort of start looking also looking at this whole concept of synchrony on a triadic kind of thing so the baby, the practitioner and the mother and see if actually if we find that the synchrony actually between mother and baby is a marker of for example, the baby would be some markers of autonomic change, changes in autonomic arousal, for example.
6365922	6373230	778	C	1	Like we observed, for example, the effect of effective touch, gentle touch on the baby sat and so on.
6373840	6375260	779	A	0.99919	Thank you, Ian.
6378980	6399460	780	B	0.99887	George, just as you were saying about the challenge of a practitioner being moving whilst during a manual therapy session and I'm sort of aware of how that does lead to some difficulties, especially with the PPG sort of measurement of heart rate variability.
6400300	6413080	781	B	0.93	I heard just an idea I heard about, I don't know if you've come across it a wearable ECG that it's aimed at increasing respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
6413840	6424590	782	B	1	It vibrates and it stimulates the person, catches them at the top of their outbreath and it's designed to actually be used whilst you're walking around in everyday life.
6425940	6439044	783	B	0.99904	So I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity there because it's designed to A, increase RSA and B to be used whilst moving.
6439162	6443030	784	B	0.99992	That might be an interesting piece of kit to use.
6444840	6446390	785	C	0.89	Yeah, absolutely.
6447720	6448470	786	A	0.99981	Cool.
6448840	6452440	787	A	0.74215	Blue or would anyone else like any comments?
6453980	6456410	788	F	1	I just want to give a final thought.
6456780	6472110	789	F	0.84217	So something that I'm going to be thinking about for, I don't know, whoever knows how long is this idea of the emotional and physical body in terms of reference point.
6472640	6495028	790	F	0.99588	Right, so we studied in, I think, Live Stream 40, the FEP for Generic Quantum Systems, and it talked about how the FEP drives entanglement and in this way, when there's perfect learning, there's this overlapping of the reference point.
6495194	6507672	791	F	0.99992	So I just wonder, how can an emotional body and a physical body be driven toward a more overlapping reference frame when those things are so fundamentally different?
6507806	6509610	792	F	0.9999	So I'm going to be thinking about that.
6511340	6512090	793	A	0.99882	Cool.
6512560	6513630	794	A	0.99312	Very cool.
6515600	6520524	795	A	0.99852	All right, well, thank you for this excellent two.
6520642	6527560	796	A	0.99995	That concludes 44 and really appreciated the authors joining.
6527640	6533276	797	A	1	And Blue, thank you for joining Ian, also for contributing so much with the dot zero.
6533458	6541476	798	A	1	And everyone is welcome back to give us updates on their learning and application on this very important area.
6541578	6543236	799	A	0.99757	So thanks again, everybody.
6543338	6544230	800	A	0.99997	See you later.
6545080	6545780	801	C	0.99977	Thank you.
6545850	6546612	802	B	0.99928	Thank you.
6546746	6547776	803	B	0.65692	Goodbye.
6547968	6548288	804	C	0.97002	Bye.
