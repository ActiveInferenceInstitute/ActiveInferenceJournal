28100	47748	1	A	1.0	00:28	44	Hello and welcome, everyone. It's ActInf Lab Livestream number 44.2, and it's May 25, 2022. Welcome to the ActInf lab. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this slide.
47924	92968	2	A	0.99986	00:47	106	This is a recorded and an archived Livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams. If you want to learn more about the live streams or any other projects at Active Inferencelab, check out activeinference.org. Okay, today in 44.2, we are in our third discussion around the paper, therapeutic alliance as Active Inference the Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony from 2022 by the authors listed here. And Ian and I had a dot zero where we contextualized and went over some of the outline of the paper.
93134	118756	3	A	0.99996	01:33	72	Then we had a great discussion last week with several of the authors in the dot one, and today we're here with some of the authors, and we'll see who else joins. And we'll be continuing that discussion around the paper. We left a few threads, but also we can just take it wherever people would like to go. And we'll begin just by saying hello. People can say anything they want.
118858	140480	4	A	0.95	01:58	55	And how is this week different than last week? How are we approaching this paper differently? Or what would we like to resolve or address in this two that was stimulated by the dot one or that we didn't get to in the one? Feel free to add anything in that area. So, I'm Daniel.
140580	162160	5	A	0.96104	02:20	49	I'm a researcher in California, and one piece in the two that I'd like to explore would be what are the entities that we're discussing here at what scales, and how to think about that in terms of their generative model and so on. And I'll pass to Ian.
167780	216060	6	B	0.97	02:47	97	Hello. Thank you, Daniel. And yes, I would like to maybe pick up on if we've got time on the topic of synchrony this week and what types of synchrony might we be talking about? What things might be oscillating that come into sort of phase lock between two agents that have the potential to synchronize and then where do they head towards with their synchrony? And then if we've got time, thinking about tying this all back to some of the core ideas about minimizing free energy and what does that mean in a therapeutic setting?
218900	226050	7	B	1.0	03:38	20	Yes. That's it, I think. Thank you. Awesome. All right, any of the authors, feel free to go for it.
229620	231670	8	C	0.93071	03:49	4	Zoe, play this first.
238600	262520	9	C	0.75094	03:58	56	Okay, so I'm George. I'm one of the authors on this paper. I'm an osteopath and researcher. And where do I see this going forward? I pretty much enjoyed the interaction we had last week and very happy to kind of be left by you guys, Ian and Daniel, and anybody else that want to join.
262600	302650	10	C	0.95	04:22	89	I think we can definitely explore those ideas about the synchronization to agents, and arguably more than two agents when we operate in a kind of not in a diadic setting, but actually in a triadic setting. For example, pediatric care, kind of elderly care and so on, actually, there's an additional agent in the whole thing. So what do I look forward to? The discussion kind of stimulate some ideas about ways in which we can move forward with this to the more empirical state of the research.
305590	323686	11	B	0.98361	05:05	43	Great. Zoe. Hi, I'm Zoe. I'm an Osteopath as well, based in Singapore, and I'm the primary author for this paper. Yeah, happy to be led by anyone that wants to where we want to go, but definitely happy to talk about synchrony.
323798	342560	12	D	1.0	05:23	50	I think, as George said, it would be important to talk about not just diadic, but triadic or otherwise, because I think that adds a lot of depth to it. But also it's easier to sort of discuss the effects of synchrony and also the fact that you can be.
346450	348880	13	A	0.58374	05:46	6	Okay, lost Zoe for a second.
351570	360130	14	D	0.99989	05:51	25	Anyone that wants to ask questions. Okay. Also, Zoe, is there, like, any other microphone to use, or could you speak closer to the microphone?
363750	377038	15	D	0.99977	06:03	33	I'm just using my laptop, so there isn't really a microphone. I can take my headphones off if that makes a difference. It's fine. It's just a little quiet, but it's fine. Okay.
377144	382054	16	D	0.84081	06:17	15	Sorry. Oh, no, it's totally all good. Just want us to check. Okay. All right.
382092	411860	17	A	0.99997	06:22	60	Let us pick up with the synchrony then. So I guess just to kind of recall, how was this question of synchrony approached in the active inference literature and maybe even outside of the active inference literature, and then how was synchrony approached in this paper? Why was that such a core topic in this approach that the authors took?
415830	497600	18	D	1.0	06:55	182	I think we started with synchrony as the main part, mainly because when we were talking about the therapeutic alliance, synchrony and getting on with the other person is kind of key. And the way that we approached this paper, primarily in terms of a lot of the aspects of how we achieved that good therapeutic alliance was through synchrony. So that's kind of where that's one of the reasons through active inference. It was also about I started the research when I was looking at it right from sort of the start and looking at how communication worked and why people would want to sort of synchronize together and why people to implement active inference into sort of the structure that we had. It was important to kind of see why that would be beneficial because we wanted to use or we like to say that the synchrony enables us to work together to then therefore save free energy, be more efficient, and then that's how we very much used it to apply this active inference sort of framework around it.
498210	545574	19	D	1.0	08:18	107	And so I felt that it was very key without the synchrony element. It was kind of the backbone into which a lot of the aspects of active inference in the way that we achieve therapeutic alliance seemed to sort of center around. Without that connection between the different people, we wouldn't be able to save energy to work together, to have a better relationship with our practitioners, with the patients and practitioner. We wouldn't be able to get the clinical applications and benefits from it. So I saw synchrony as sort of the key medal to sort of get to where the sort of paper was.
545632	630680	20	D	0.93001	09:05	140	So it was sort of a key concept to use in order to implement it all together. George. Yeah, let's say when we started the project actually kind of putting some ideas along the lines of how could we apply predictive processing and the free energy active inference within osteopathy and within the osteopathic setting. Synchrony came along actually after the initial discussion with Karl Frieston that kind of suggested know look into this stuff because actually could be quite a robust way of understanding what goes on in the clinic room when two people are working together with a specific kind of aim. There is a little bit of literature in psychotherapy kind of demonstrating that actually the therapeutic alliance becomes much more robust when two people synchronize and both at the kind of behavioral but also biological level.
631770	683240	21	C	0.85	10:31	126	And it was nothing about sort of okay, this is about pure verbal communication, nonverbal but primarily by kind of copying body movements and so on to think, okay, how can this be applied in the context of actually an approach that is largely hands on based as a manual therapy? So that's where it kind of started from. It was one way of trying, like Zoe said, kind of looking at therapeutic alliance when people interact to try and understand what goes on in the diadic setting. Kind of two people but also a little bit beyond of what happens when there's actually more people involved in that therapeutic relationship that need to be consulted, need to be involved in the process and so on.
685870	688170	22	C	0.98449	11:25	7	That was the kind of early stage.
690430	732610	23	C	0.81	11:30	113	And then we thought that actually this is a good way of understanding a little bit more about how we can create the conditions of developing a strong kind of ecological niche that is based on that synchrony of that sort of understanding of that give and take. Like a little bit like we talked about last week, the kind of the Bird song. People taking turns, kind of understanding, listening, okay, acting kind of taking on, go back and so on. And that's sort of, in a sense, like kind of a nice wave that goes back and forth. But it is a kind of very nice and tranquil kind of wave.
732770	755360	24	C	0.99997	12:12	56	Not a one that just crashes and destroys everything, but actually one where once that kind of goes on a little bit like the pendulum kind of analogy once you introduce that nice pendulum kind of things happen. That's where we sort of thought it could be one way of exploring the whole process of care.
757650	759310	25	A	0.99843	12:37	3	Thank you, Ian.
762210	763200	26	B	0.99747	12:42	2	Thank you.
765430	823570	27	B	0.99459	12:45	126	I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony and the little bits I've read in the literature about how measurable things that might be able to synchronize between one or two or more people. So, Daniel, I think we discussed this in the zero. So choirs singing together, they have been shown their heart rates kind of synchronize with their breathing. And I think in the paper there was some references cited for similar sort of stuff in drumming circles, for example. So that really interests me and I can kind of begin to see how in a therapeutic setting, that kind of synchrony could lead someone who's maybe stressed and anxious into a kind of more healthy increased parasympathetic activity and that is conducive to healing.
825350	865410	28	B	0.64	13:45	90	But I've also got these other sort of nagging things about synchrony as well that maybe I touched on the dot zero, which is what are we synchronizing towards and is it always beneficial? So the less kind of lockstep synchrony that you talked about, Daniel. So maybe it's just, let's say a child saying, mummy, mummy, mummy, waving their arms around and then the mum synchronize, they synchronize their attention together. So you get mother and child and then you've got a choice. So there's some aspect that's synchronized.
865910	901690	29	B	1.0	14:25	78	I think in the paper it talked about the arms and the limbs and the voice kind of synchronizing and the facial expressions. But a caregiver might then lead the child to a soothing kind of parasympathetic way soothe it. Or it might say, give it a clip behind the ear and say, children us to be seen and not heard and try and stop the attention. The attention is synchronized, but the action may not be therapeutic.
903790	957440	30	B	0.92	15:03	113	Yeah, I'm just sort of thinking about where you know, where just because something's synchronized, does it mean it's always minimizing free energy or just because things in the therapeutic world go in and out of fashion? So frontal lobotomy is okay, we don't do that anymore. But for a while there was some kind of synchronized thinking in the therapeutic world that that's a good idea for people. And there are ideas that I hear in the wider kind of therapy world that are fashionable and they're being applied, but in 50 years time we may look that they may have been leading people away from minimizing free energy or improving health.
961410	965250	31	B	0.82983	16:01	9	My thoughts. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, a lot there. George.
967190	1004042	32	C	1.0	16:07	79	I think the interesting thing, there are nagging questions there for sure. The first one, do we always synchronize and when if you don't synchronize what we're going to do, because clearly there are cases where we know the therapeutic relationship is going nowhere. We can say whatever we can, try our best, but actually, there is resistance to change from the patients. We end up not understanding each other. And arguably, that's a relationship that will not evolve.
1004186	1038442	33	C	0.99	16:44	87	And, well, you might even get to a point at the end. Maybe it'd be a good idea to go and see a colleague of mine kind of thing. Okay, so do we synchronize with everybody? No, clearly not. Is there any value understanding this stuff by sometimes understanding that some kind of gestures and sort of body language and so on, voice, sound, sort of communication style, we're probably giving us cues maybe to adapt a little bit to try and synchronize a little bit better.
1038496	1062274	34	C	1.0	17:18	66	I think that's useful. I think important in order to be a good communicator. I think first and foremost, sometimes people worry too much about the technical skills and the ability of doing X and Y and doing some miracles and so on. Arguably the first thing that people need to be in a clinical setting is good communicator and a pretty good, nice person. Okay?
1062312	1113060	35	C	1.0	17:42	120	And I think if that's there, I think we create the conditions in good communicators likely to have potentially better outcomes that guys that basically don't care and sort of they're the experts and so on. The other question is, is it always about minimizing free energy? Because there are situations where probably you want to short circuit the whole thing, isn't it? You want to sort of flatten a little bit of that sort of sensory state. You want to create a condition where the only way you can sort of change the generative model is actually by creating a massive surprise, a massive prediction error that arguably surprises the system in a way like, wow, what just happened?
1113590	1164370	36	C	0.99	18:33	124	And actually, oh, okay, I don't think it's always about minimizing free energy, but sometimes I think you want to shock the whole thing because the system on the other side wants to minimize free energy for sure. If I'm a kind of chronic pain patient and I'm scared of moving and you tell me to move and so on, the reaction is I anticipate the likelihood of movement leading to pain. I anticipate the consequences of actions in the future, the typical active inference model. And I lock, I don't move. So I probably want to short circuit the whole thing to create a condition where it's actually okay to move because it's not going to cause any harm, is it, through synchrony?
1165830	1215986	37	C	1.0	19:25	116	Maybe it isn't. Okay, so I think that's not, I think, a kind of one size fits all kind of thing. And I don't think it's just about sort of always that minimizing free energy because I think creating change that is meaningful change probably needs a little bit more of it needs to destroy that sort of strong prior kind of thing so I can implant another chip kind of thing in a metaphorical way. And that's why we know in some mental health conditions why some types of drugs like catamine and so on, create that condition that sort of zeros. The whole thing is a bit like you reset the button, isn't it?
1216008	1231890	38	C	1.0	20:16	46	The computer is stuck. What you do, you've tried everything. You unplug the computer and then you try again. The whole thing reboots, isn't it? So I think sometimes that's the analogy of maybe what we want to achieve in the setting is it through synchrony?
1232230	1258000	39	C	0.93	20:32	72	I personally, I don't know, and I'm not entirely sure. Of course, if the people started understanding each other, then that creates the conditions for this thing probably to happen. Because if you don't understand me as a practitioner, I don't understand you as a patient, it's pretty hard that actually I create the condition for change. So maybe it's through synchrony, but again, as a sort of big question marks, really.
1261170	1264180	40	A	0.84804	21:01	4	Thanks. Yes. Zoe, please.
1266230	1297366	41	D	0.99	21:06	79	Yeah, so I think going off what I mean, overall, the goal would be to minimize free energy. But to be able to do that, you have to sort of at some point challenge it, right? You're not going to have the same belief that you think is the most efficient. When you're born to when you die, the way that you become reduced energy is going to change over time. You'll see that especially in sort of pediatrics.
1297398	1324066	42	D	1.0	21:37	89	You see it in sport. There's a lot of studies with running, for example, that show that the more you run, often the more mileage that people do when they run, the more efficient they get. So I think free energy is, yes, we all want to reduce it, but at some point we've got to update it and challenge it, right? So it won't be sort of just this linear thing where you're constantly just changing it. You've got to update it and challenge it at some point.
1324088	1383334	43	D	0.76026	22:04	150	So it will sort of be a little bit of a roller coaster and have a few dips where you got to take that risk to see if there's another way that is more efficient, that will save it more. Whether synchrony is always necessary, I'm not sure. I definitely think that when you're unsure whether or if your prior is not so precise and you're not 100% sure that that is the best way to do whatever you're doing, or you're not 100% certain that your belief explains what's going on, then I think you're more likely to synchronize with others. I think once you're quite certain on what you think and what you're going to do, then it's a lot harder to synchronize. Like with the cognitive sort of immunity when you've got chronic pain, it's a lot harder to change that because you're convinced that you're right.
1383372	1392940	44	D	0.9996	23:03	29	You've had this pain for years, maybe, and you know what it's like. If you bend forward, it's going to hurt. So why would you bother to challenge that?
1395970	1441402	45	D	1.0	23:15	118	I think there's a lot of studies that show that, especially with sort of babies, that they synchronize with their when they're younger the synchrony is very consistent. Obviously they need to work with their caregiver to get their alleystatic needs and everything that they need to keep surviving. But it shows that they do still think when they're adults but the time when they're older or in adulthood that they do think is when they're unsure. When something happens and you are near that caregiver and you don't know, you still sort of rely on them. Say I don't know, you get into a car accident or something and there's a big shock and you're not sure.
1441536	1478966	46	D	0.99998	24:01	90	Often the child will still, no matter how old they are, will look to the parent, obviously unless the parent is very elderly. But generally speaking in times of uncertainty you will look towards someone else. So I think is synchrony always necessary? No but I think if you're not 100% certain with your priors and you are questioning it or there is a doubt of that questioning it, then I think synchrony will play more of a role in it and I'll pass it back to you. Awesome, thanks.
1479068	1496182	47	A	1.0	24:39	45	Yeah, just thinking about beliefs in the way that we might talk about them. Hey, blue. Welcome. Just the way that we might conversationally talk about beliefs. If somebody is unsure about something that's when they look to be synchronized by some other informational resource.
1496246	1582534	48	A	0.99934	24:56	205	I'm not sure what time this thing opens so I'm going to look it up in this way or I'm going to ask this person or I'm not sure where to go so I'm going to follow the crowd. We see that kind of in the ant pheromone trail, we see that in the social media, all these different areas. And then conversely when somebody does have a more confident, more built up prior then that's more like going their own way and potentially being more resistant to external contrasting information and then translating from that one conversational meaning of belief like I believe that is going to open at this time into a broader Bayesian perspective on Bayesian brain and body and thinking about pain and perception as also parameters that can be seen as beliefs in this Bayesian sense. So not always like a psychological experienced belief but in some statistical way it's like they're held stances that are updated in some way or partially or completely by certain kinds of incoming information. So Ian and then also this is going to be I think very interesting to return to the free energy minimization and unpack what we mean by free energy there.
1582572	1583960	49	A	0.99166	26:22	4	So Ian. Go for.
1586410	1641210	50	B	0.89108	26:26	117	Thanks. So, yeah, I'm just sort of wanting to check that some of the language used in other realms of therapy. So this idea of self regulation and co regulation, are we saying here that this synchrony in the therapeutic reliance is a form of co regulation that we hear a lot about in people with disorder problems of their autonomic nervous system? And then we say, you go to a therapist to help co regulate your autonomic nervous system. Is that what we're saying as synchrony is the kind of mechanism for co regulation which I believe fits with what you're saying, zoe that children need that more and as adults we might do that occasionally.
1642110	1686780	51	B	0.93	27:22	102	And then I'm just thinking also other forms of therapeutic synchrony and co regulation. So meeting friends for a you know, I might be having a bit of a stressful week or a wobble in some way, and then I meet some friends and we kind of seek counsel in each other, have a synchronize our movement of our hands to our mouth with a coffee cup or listen to some music together, tap our feet together. And that's a kind of therapeutic. So are we all kind of doing this on and off all the time? They're my thoughts or questions.
1689310	1692570	52	B	0.88	28:09	5	Yes. George zoe, then? George.
1695390	1742298	53	E	0.99	28:15	111	Yeah. No, I just wanted to say yes. With the co regulation. I think that we kind of not always but I think we do add an element to try and suggest that we'd like to say that we in part help co regulation and as a practitioner to achieve sort of recovery and reduce pain and help. I think we all want to say that we help in that process and that we help regulate their sort of disruptive pattern, whether that's inflammation, whether that's pain, whatever sort of metric that you want to rate your treatment by or whatever your treatment goals are that you're sort of working towards.
1742384	1799920	54	D	1.0	29:02	122	I think we all want to say that we sort of help regulate which ways we regulate in terms of whether we actually change their heart rate or things like that. We're not always so specific about we don't have the research to kind of show that. But I think certainly there is elements of sympathetic and parasympathetic things that we do, as well as sort of the intent to co regulate even if we don't sort of empirically do it or achieve it. Whether just that reassurance that we're attempting to help regulate their pain, I think is sort of the intention that I hope that as a practitioner I am giving off to my patients and I'll let George speak.
1804610	1887434	55	C	0.96	30:04	173	I think if you come from a manual therapy background, a touch based, hands on approach, one could argue, or old school kind of beliefs in the profession, christian Osteopathy would argue that actually how you achieve that core regulation, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic parasympathetic is primarily through the use of techniques. You use a technique in a particular part of the body and this affects the parasympathetic part and so on the vagus nerve and all that stuff that sort of implies there is a tool by which you can apply that stuff, treat that particular bit and by miracle modulate everything. I used to be there, no longer there because the evidence isn't strong enough to actually support those clients on the other hand, if we add another element, which is the element the synchrony. And the synchrony here goes beyond just that sort of passive practitioner led type of intervention into something that implies communication, implies alignment attuning to the environment. And the environment there is the practitioner as well.
1887552	1923926	56	C	0.82527	31:27	100	So the other person in the room, the guy that is facilitating the process. So it sort of takes us, I think, away from this idea that everything is about touches, everything is about the manual stuff and so on. But it becomes a kind of a multipronged approach where touch matters, that communication matters as much as touch. And it's not a technique X, Y or NZ, but it's actually the whole package of care that's likely to enable us to get there. So is it similar I like your analogy to sort of tough day and so on.
1923948	1975080	57	C	0.61	32:03	136	You go out, you need to see your friends, you need to synchronize in a different environment because ultimately people will talk to each other and correlate regulate each other even in terms of reducing allostatic load of a tough week and so on. There are kind of things that are similar to what happens in the clinical setting. One of them, we're probably thinking about reward systems as well. There's a sort of a participation in something that is likely to, even if uncomfortable, is let is going to lead to some improvement. Maybe there's some dopamine stuff, maybe there is a reward pathways that are kind of involved in the whole thing, like having a drink in the same having a therapeutic intervention that ultimately is going to get me to a better state.
1975530	2044650	58	C	0.69	32:55	134	I think it's very analogous to moving away from the free energy principle and to an area that kind of works alongside that inactivism, the concept of sense making, what inactivists would argue participatory sense making. So synchrony could be kind of also looked from that lens, from that perspective. Whereas two people or more than two people either in a group having a drink and all kind of helping each other because I listen, or in a therapeutic setting that sort of participatory things, making minimizing free energy or autopoeasies for the kind of the inactivists. Actually, I think we sort of looking at the same phenomena, maybe with different language, but arguably the same kind of phenomena. I think it's that package that probably helps core regulation rather than just one intervention.
2045810	2054000	59	A	0.99367	34:05	13	Thank you, Blue. Welcome. Do you want to add anything or ask anything?
2056370	2073046	60	F	0.99935	34:16	52	Not right off the bat, just hi, it's nice to be here with you guys. I'm sorry I missed last week and I've really enjoyed the discussions of the paper so far. And I'll jump in, in a little bit. I think you guys were engrossed in a good conversation. Okay, awesome.
2073148	2117678	61	A	0.99959	34:33	110	So the Dopamine angle and a few other things we'll return to. But we were talking about minimizing free energy and I wanted to show a few images from the textbook because even those who have seen free energy come up in a lot of different settings, sometimes returning to the basics is a generator that helps us take it in many other ways. And for those who are maybe focused more on the clinical setting or have more of that background, this can provide a little other tissues around the connective tissue. Free energy is being used like a connective tissue here. It's bridging a lot of different ideas.
2117774	2188300	62	A	0.78602	35:17	133	It's helping us connect different sensory modalities and therapeutic modalities. So just a few cool images from the active inference textbook. So here is Figure 2.3 and it's the action perception loop and the two ways that discrepancies related to predictions or expectations, the two ways that discrepancies about observations can be reduced just qualitatively is through changing belief and changing action. And it's some blend of those two that individual entities are engaged in in this action perception loop. And then when we're specifically talking about free energy, there's some type of equation, this is like a simple form of it that is going to make that discrepancy minimization tractable and possible to calculate for at least us doing statistics from outside the system, if not for the system itself to do.
2188910	2219726	63	A	1.0	36:28	54	And what is the real sort of hidden goal? Is this minimization of true surprise. But the minimization of true surprise is intractable or it's inaccessible. And so free energy serves as like this upper bound. Whereas if we can reduce this upper bound, we're getting implicitly closer to this asymptotic reduction of surprise.
2219918	2242060	64	A	0.99875	36:59	43	So who is doing this reduction of surprise that relates to the entity question what is the entity that's actually doing free energy minimization? And so what are the entities that we're talking about here? What does it mean to minimize free energy?
2244910	2261860	65	A	1.0	37:24	51	I liked how earlier it was brought up when sometimes where that free energy minimization was going with the flow and then sometimes when there was a flow disrupt. So what is free energy minimization and what are the entities and how are we modeling that? Ian and then anyone else?
2265670	2314574	66	B	0.99977	37:45	81	Thanks. Yeah, that question of what are the entities and linking it back to George's point about sense making and inactivism. So in the paper there was some really interesting stuff on realizing that we're all alike in the therapeutic alliance and relating that back to sense making. I'm thinking that therapeutically or in a manual therapy or meeting friends, the outcome might be I'm not a weirdo, I haven't done anything wrong, everything's okay. Again, I'm relaxed and that's therapeutic.
2314702	2326600	67	B	0.99997	38:34	32	So I'm amongst people who are very much alike me. And that's the sense making. There's the pattern recognition. I'm a valuable member of my tribe, however you want to describe it.
2331210	2337720	68	B	1.0	38:51	11	But we're never completely identical. Or are we? I don't know.
2340830	2352080	69	B	1.0	39:00	33	The proposal in the paper is that that's the ultimate realization that we're all alike. And I can kind of see. That that's a kind of relieving thing to realize. But we're similar.
2354130	2376420	70	B	0.94392	39:14	54	I'm similar to my pet dog in that I've got eyes and I breathe and my heart beats and I can synchronize in some ways with that, and it feels nice, but my dog can't help me do my accounts, for example. So, yes, this alikeness. And how does that fit into sense making?
2378550	2422142	71	A	0.99966	39:38	128	Thanks, Blue. So, as I've been reading the textbook, I've been thinking a lot about the hidden states. And it's interesting to think about that in terms of using touch to kind of resolve uncertainty about the hidden states. Because while a state might be hidden to the patient, when you present with some, like, I've got a pain in my shoulder or something like that, it might be easy for the therapist to say, oh, that's this, this, and I push here and tweak this, and then it's better. So it might be hidden to the patient but not hidden to the doctor, or hidden to the doctor and the patient, or hidden to the patient but not the doctor, or the doctor but not the patient.
2422206	2450880	72	F	0.99993	40:22	81	So it might be like all of these things. And so it's like working together, this kind of synchrony to resolve uncertainty about a hidden state. And I've thought a lot about who's making the observation and who's doing the state observing and who is the state hidden to. And it brings back the paper that you guys mentioned in the zero the communication as active inference because it really is like a bi directional, harmonious kind of thing happening. Right.
2451490	2455550	73	A	0.99991	40:51	4	Awesome. Thanks. Yes. George.
2461110	2508638	74	D	0.95	41:01	95	Yeah. So actually, starting with the hidden states, who's observing, who's been observed? I think the free energy model or picture the typical representation with the two agents and or one agent in the world and internal states, external states and so on. If you have the two agents, there's something in the middle that clearly is the ground where we kind of try to achieve some form of alignment. And then that sort of implies the reading of someone else's internal state, I think, who makes the observation, who's been observed and so on.
2508724	2559550	75	C	0.87	41:48	102	I think, again, is the birdsong is a give and take because there are clearly situations where you may be telling your patient that actually is nothing to worry about, for example, where you're not particularly sure about what's going on and the patient can clearly read in your body language that, no, it's hiding something from me. Right. It's something there that doesn't feel right. Actually. There's an interesting phenomena, for example, in chronic conditions, which is the concept of cognitive immunization, where it's very common these days for patient goes and sees a practitioner, has read, has consulted with Dr.
2559620	2572674	76	C	0.99954	42:39	32	Google to start. Dr. Google said it could be x, Y, and Z, typically the worst case scenario. Goes and sees doctor number one. Doctor number one says, yeah, you know what?
2572792	2625574	77	C	0.99879	42:52	137	Nothing to worry about. There's nothing wrong with you. Patient has got pain, kind of saying, all right, I don't trust you kind of thing, then goes and sees practitioner number two. That comes with a different story and yeah, okay, maybe you forget about if forgotten about something goes to practitioner number three and so on and gets through a process where authors argue that the system becomes cognitively immune to any new explanations because the expectation is surely there's something wrong with me. So clearly in those conditions, if we take from this lens, one could argue, yeah, as a patient, I'm observing you, I'm kind of reading your internal states, which is I don't trust you kind of thing because you're telling me something, but actually something that potentially you don't believe either, okay.
2625692	2666382	78	C	0.99987	43:45	111	Or this thing about, let's do cognitive reassurance because most nonspecific back pain or neck pain, one cannot say that's clearly a particular tissue responsible for the pain, the symptoms and so on. So you say, okay, there's nothing serious with you, so what's wrong with me? You clearly can't tell the patient you've got nonspecific back pain because for the patient that means you haven't got a clue about what's wrong with me. Or you're implying that something upstairs in my head, I'm making it up. So patients observe us for sure, and they know when we kind of are confident and so on, and when we're not so confident.
2666446	2712580	79	C	0.95	44:26	122	And maybe we're not entirely sure if actually the whole thing is going to happen. In the same way we observe patients, we start observing them when they come through the door, when you first greet them and so on, hi, how are you doing? Before COVID times, shaking hands and so on were a pretty good first kind of getting into someone else's internal state because just the handshake, the quality of the amount of pressure, the confidence and so on. There were cases say this person is anxious, this person is down, is depressed, and so on. And you could get that down to when you do clinical examination, you touch, you observe, you feel, you palpate and so on.
2714630	2768002	80	C	0.5484	45:14	109	That implies that there is a lot of unconscious stuff. That process comes through, arrives through our sensory, our sensorian and we make something out of it. So I think that's what we kind of one of the things we try to explore through this stuff about try to understand someone else's internal state, predicting a little bit of their mental state. And that's where synchrony and that's where alignment kind of plays that important role because if there's no alignment, I can't clearly guess what's wrong going on. The stuff about Ian, what you mentioned about sense making and so on, sense making is quite an interesting thing.
2768056	2815300	81	C	0.94	46:08	103	You said, okay, we're not like a patient is a patient and the practitioner is a practitioner. There is that power differential as well. There's the doctor, there's the patient. When one is an expert and when the other is an expert and things alternate the whole thing about sense making and actually minimization of free energy and so on. Sense making is quite an interesting thing too when we look at some clinical conditions and there's some beautiful stuff written about, for example, mental health and inactive approaches and looking at, for example depression as a disorder of sense making, for example.
2816310	2857566	82	C	1.0	46:56	97	And you see that sometimes with patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems that also have a comorbidity they have depression. What came first? The depression of the back or the back pain? One could argue that if I suffer from chronic back pain and I can't get out of the house I can't see my friends, I can't walk my dog, I can't play with my children and so on the world stops kind of making sense, right? I don't go out because outside is a cruel world and it's kind of full of dangers and so on.
2857588	2933010	83	C	0.99994	47:37	142	So I stay in a safe environment which is my home watching telly, kind of complaining about myself to myself and I become depressed because I'm stuck there. So the therapeutic encounter that sort of nice ecological niche in a sense creates opportunity for sense making to understand where there's patterns for example, rigid behavior, rigid thinking that actually by understanding, by interacting can potentially start sort of taking the patient in a particular direction which is this kind of road to recovery. And one could argue that if someone starts feeling kind of better in themselves symptoms reduce a little bit, can start doing a little bit more, can start again engaging with the world. Maybe the other stuff about feeling miserable would get better as well. And I think that's sometimes what we see in musculoskeletal care is this stuff.
2933180	3004062	84	C	0.99971	48:53	154	We don't treat mental health conditions and I don't think we should make those claims because they're clearly boundaries and competences and so on. But the patient that has got, for example, a chronic musculoskeletal problem and gets better and gets an impact that impact changes their quality of life changes their ability to become an agent again because pain they lost their agency because of pain. I think that's where the beauty of this understanding this stuff kind of comes is you can impact on different levels of the person of the self that is clearly not just that embodied self, that body but it's beyond that embodied self. Is this multidimensional kind of what is to be a person kind of thing, right? I think at times it's about kind of reading the other understanding the other guy's internal state is about sort of doing the right thing at the right time.
3004116	3025858	85	C	0.99956	50:04	44	Because I know there's a cue that tells me maybe if I do this stuff this could be really one way of getting surprising the system in a very positive way. Okay, so I've just been pontificating. Zoe yes. Yeah. I think oh, gosh.
3025954	3037202	86	D	0.7681	50:25	28	Let me take my hand down. Okay. Yeah. I think similar to what George said on sort of it's a bird song. I think there's different aspects know?
3037356	3073960	87	D	1.0	50:37	96	Yes. Generally on the technical, the physiology or the anatomy side, then the practitioner is always obviously more the expert. But I think there's certain things where maybe you're looking at a patient or you're still trying to examine them and the patient is still going to be the expert in their pain. And so you might be tossing and turning between a few diagnosis, say, and then the patient suddenly comes up with like, oh yeah, by the way, and then what you were thinking completely goes out. So I think you completely read them.
3074330	3100960	88	E	0.99998	51:14	79	There's always going to be sort of hidden states that you don't know about and then you're always on the lookout in case the situation is changing or maybe they don't want to tell you exactly what it is and you think something's missing. That intuition that maybe there's an element of this that you're not getting, or suddenly they got worse and you're wondering, well, what happened? What changed? What goes on? And then you find out that.
3103330	3157726	89	D	0.99984	51:43	117	Their. Child'S been really sick or something, or their work has been really stressful or something else has happened, excluding that they haven't said that you kind of pick up on. So I think there's that where you're inferring what that other person means. And there's definitely you're watching them, they're watching you, and you're kind of still deciding what's going to happen based on what you think is going on throughout treatment. There's no set treatment for certain things as well, whether it's exercises or touch, you have to adapt based on what you're feeling and similarly to what you ian that brought it up before, the sort of synchrony and whether it's exact or not.
3157828	3204190	90	E	0.98705	52:37	115	Well, it sort of also depends on the stimulus. There's a lot of research that there was one paper that was about a film and they got two separate people to watch the same film by themselves at separate times, but in certain parts of the film, their heart rate was exactly the same. Their heart rate went up when the fight scene happened and then their heart rate went down the same. And actually, you know, the difference was they were in sync even though they were nowhere near each other, couldn't see each other, didn't know what that person was doing. They're probably doing completely different things, but the stimulus dictated the synchrony.
3204930	3248462	91	E	0.99169	53:24	86	So I think that's an interesting thing to consider as well, that the synchrony might be from the stimulus that's happening during the treatment, whether it's touch, whether it's something else, but we focused on touch. But yeah, whether you synchronize just based on what you're in that moment, but actually it's completely different otherwise. Yeah, just wanted to point that out. Thanks. That reminds me a lot of this direct interfacing mechanism of synchrony, which might be via, like auditory communication, touch and so on.
3248516	3295210	92	A	1.0	54:08	99	And then there's this more stigma, g based niche modification construction of a niche, like a corn maze where everybody walking through it is having a shared experience. Or like you said, with two people watching the same film. It's like there's some similarity in their niche. And so there's a resulting synchronization without direct interfacing because they're interacting in a shared there's something shared about their niche. Either two people going through the same niche at different moments, patients coming through a space, or there's people that are in separate physical spaces, but the niche has some similarity.
3296110	3308594	93	A	0.99	54:56	40	And I'm sure there's a lot of other examples like that. Ian. And then I have that image up if you want to describe what you wanted to share there. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, I will describe that in a moment.
3308632	3343386	94	B	0.98	55:08	81	But as conversation about films, I'm just thinking that Hollywood and filmmakers are actually masters of inducing synchrony. Really. They've got the birdsong, so they've got the beautiful music or the dramatic music or whatever. Got the imagery, the words, the composition of the images to hopefully not obviously not everyone will have the same experience of a film. But they hope that their sad film will induce some synchrony amongst the viewers in terms of the response in their body.
3343488	3408250	95	B	0.99834	55:43	137	Or a happy film will induce some kind of rhythmic and I'm thinking about some work I've heard. Of recently of John Viveki looking at emotional goosebumps and how this links to he thinks the process of temperature regulation is being exacted up into some kind of relevant or bringing things salient to us through goosebumps. And there's an opportunity there to kind of open up cognitively and explore some other ideas that maybe the person wasn't able to before. And you can think, okay, that music gave me goosebumps, and I had all these so, yeah, there's just a few things as we were talking there that I was thinking about. But this diagram was, George, as you were talking about, the kind of how the complex things that might be at play within a patient.
3408330	3443158	96	B	1.0	56:48	81	This was done by MIT, only found out about it a few days ago. It was 2015. But all of these different factors that might lead someone into a kind of vicious cycle of depression. And we've got things like cortisol or unbridled inflammation at the top there. But then you've also got, as you said, George, the physical inactivity and how this you've got all these different looping perception action cycles here that are creating this sort of downward spiral.
3443254	3470162	97	B	0.67	57:23	68	And therapeutically, I guess what we're trying to do is create an upward opening, trying to get an access point. And Zoe, you said you might have to try lots of looking, trying one of these loops. And if that doesn't work, okay, try a different loop to open up this sort of thing that's tightening and maybe open it up either physically or perceptually. Yeah. Thank you.
3470296	3525522	98	A	0.99998	57:50	112	This is like very much showing that complex causation. And so sometimes a disciplinary approach might be like well, hippocampal volume is associated with this change and that could absolutely be empirically true or cytokine signaling or early adverse experiences. And so part of the challenge is reassembling this complex causal network. And then even if there were some sort of causal network that could be reassembled, then how might the failure mode be similar or different from the recovery mode? Like there are certain things that cannot be changed, like in the past and there's other things kind of like the concept of hysteresis where we can't just reversibly modify something.
3525656	3534220	99	A	0.99	58:45	15	And so where are the leverage points in this diagram? And it's yeah, George, it.
3537160	3605960	100	C	0.51	58:57	127	Yeah, it's pretty complex, but yeah, very good diagram for sure. And I think there's a lot of stuff that we are talking about that's clearly there I think clearly we have modifiable and non modifiable things. There's stuff we can't change someone else's genetics, we can't change what happened in the past, okay? But they are modifiable things that at least in the context of musculoskeletal care are present that can include beliefs, their priors about their ideas about pain, what's wrong with them and so on down to things that could be lifestyle and lifestyle could be more movement, kind of changing the diet or whatever. Stop smoking, kind of engaging in something that starts getting them kind of start getting their sense making back.
3606030	3606650	101	C	0.99765	1:00:06	1	Okay.
3608700	3618300	102	C	0.98598	1:00:08	18	Through the sense, the ideas. And actually the other interesting thing about this stuff where are the opportunities?
3620800	3676704	103	C	0.99995	1:00:20	119	How can we start that process of change? A very nice model, typically aligned more with an activist approach now sort of finding ways into pain and so on, are the ecological psychology ideas about affordances. What is out there in the environment? Already linked some authors to kind of the active inference, predictive processing and so on. But clearly one can think about the world provides us with a landscape of affordances stuff that kind of are opportunities for action, which is basically what the description of an affordance is and one that lives in a very nice environment, for example, with a beautiful park and can walk along the coastline and stress free environment and so on.
3676742	3710188	104	C	0.99995	1:01:16	95	Clearly that world, it's a world for the sort of beautiful kind of lifestyle and so on, right? Whereas if one lives in an urban jungle and everybody's super stressed outside and so on, arguably that landscape kind of is much smaller. And when we say, yeah, would be good for you to start walking, for example, that would be a good way of start managing your back pain. The patient can say, yeah, but when I get out of the house, I'm struggling. I might just get run over by a car straight away.
3710354	3716030	105	C	1.0	1:01:50	15	The environment outside is awful. There's pollution everywhere. What do you want me to do?
3718400	3765388	106	C	0.99963	1:01:58	127	I'm scared of going outside. So, no, thank you very much. But of course, if you are on the other side of the spectrum, you can invite the person and use what's out there and start playing a little bit with those opportunities for action. I think those are tools that if we think sometimes we can start thinking very hard about what sort of exercises should the patient do, should the person get engaged and so on. And if we think much in much simpler terms and think about what's outside, what's out there, what kind of things are already in the environment that can be used to actually promote change, we would be surprised that actually just a flight of stairs would be good enough.
3765474	3796672	107	C	0.99989	1:02:45	79	Don't take the lift. Take the stairs and start sort of walking a little bit back and forth from home to work and so on. Those minimal things, if the person feels like, yeah, okay, I'll have a go, and I'll try that. Clearly we are in that process of kind of changing a little bit of their sort of internal state. Maybe that prior about, yeah, I can't move, I can't lift, because it will damage my back.
3796746	3802410	108	C	0.50367	1:03:16	15	In fact, when they start trusting their bodies, they can do a little bit more.
3804780	3820030	109	C	0.62417	1:03:24	42	It's always hard to think about, okay, how can I change this? How can I change the generative model? And we almost think everything needs to be conscious, cognitive and so on, when in fact, a lot of stuff happens unconsciously. Right?
3822080	3836470	110	C	1.0	1:03:42	43	If it was always about, I'm going to think about changing and I'm going to do this, then the world would be much simpler. Right. But a lot of stuff is hidden anyway, and even the person is not aware of that stuff.
3838760	3875010	111	C	0.98491	1:03:58	97	So the change, the process, the tools and so on, that goes back to that very good diagram with all these factors. And I think as a practitioner, yes, okay. I can focus entirely on the brain and the neuroscience of it and become like a brain centric approach, or I can start thinking about actually the brain is it's the hardware kind of stuff, but there's much more in it and much more in it. Takes the person, takes the environment, takes the kind of opportunities and so on. The stuff out there can be used.
3876100	3878000	112	A	0.99939	1:04:36	4	Thank you, George. Zoe?
3880580	3920716	113	D	1.0	1:04:40	101	Yeah. Just going off of what George said in terms of the environment around it, like when you're sort of maybe if you're surrounded by nature or things like that, then you might be sort of more willing or more able to change your priors. I think it's also important to realize, especially through touch, that it's one modality. Right. It's one way in which we're starting to kind of try to understand and try to manipulate the process of sort of changing those memories, whether it's the way it's processed or just having initially or just trying to adapt it.
3920738	3962028	114	E	1.0	1:05:20	104	And that's that touch is one way. But I think also it's interesting that it's probably more likely that we may not be able to completely change that sort of prior, but we might in that context. So we might not change the fact that it's painful to bend down, but we might be able to, through touch and through sort of treatment, get the patient to realize, okay, well, yes, maybe bending forwards is dangerous. It is a bad thing. But if you do it in a certain way and you look at it in this way, then actually it's not so bad.
3962194	4004068	115	E	0.82113	1:06:02	110	So I think it's important to take the context into it. I think with this, I think we might be able to maybe not completely change the maladaptive belief, but with touch we can try to change it so that it's more context specific rather than a general belief that isn't able to change. We might be able to change it. So in certain circumstances, whether it's the way we do things or just the way that we approach things, we might be able to update it or modify it for that specific thing. I know that papers were talking about it in terms of like being scared of spiders.
4004244	4032210	116	E	0.97	1:06:44	95	You might still be scared of spiders, but if you know that you're scared of spiders and they've got food nearby and the spider is happy, then maybe, yeah, the spider is still scary, but it's not likely to kill you or something like that. In this circumstance, it's not as bad as it could be and you're going to be safe from whatever sort of fear it is. So I think that's an important thing to add on from what George was saying, and I'll pass it back to George. Yes, George. And then.
4035640	4038550	117	C	0.85168	1:07:15	5	Know what Zoe just said.
4040760	4074188	118	C	0.95813	1:07:20	68	It's quite important. And through touch we can clearly get in kind of affect, understand and so on. I think that's all the positive stuff about touch. There's another factor, another side of the equation which I think as practitioners we need to be aware of, which is the power of what's the hidden state and that touch can trigger. And particularly in trauma situations, memories are embodied.
4074284	4129170	119	C	1.0	1:07:54	130	And when you touch someone in a particular part of the body, that might again bring that unconscious stuff about. For example, someone has been victim of sexual abuse for example and you could touch a person and straight away either there is a sort of a massive response fight or flight what's going on here? Or if it is about this sort of hidden state you might actually find that that touch kind of created a response that is almost like a no go zone. And you kind of need to be aware that sometimes you touch people that don't like being touched. Someone goes to a clinician that in an intervention is primarily touch based, doesn't like being touched, it might go well, it might synchronize extremely well.
4129620	4162444	120	C	0.98562	1:08:49	88	They understand you, they talk when you start, say, okay, let's have a look. Let's palpate that you can feel like there's a fight or flight kind of mode. The person goes in straight away. So I think understanding this is also quite important in understanding the limits of competence of someone in Musculoskeletal care, for example, that that's an area that where probably the person needs to be referred to someone else, an expert in the area. Maybe by getting a sense of there's a response here.
4162482	4200936	121	C	0.99829	1:09:22	78	That's not the one I would expect to perhaps not then to open the Pandora box. Oh, tell me a little bit about what's going on here because again, you pressed on a button that keep the lid on kind of thing. Don't open it, please. This is important, I think, both ways. It's kind of the power as a therapeutic tool, but also the power of triggering responses that actually are quite important to take into account.
4201038	4253290	122	C	1.0	1:10:01	125	And in fact, the paper we got accepted yesterday, which is the continuation of this in musculoskeletal care, one of the reviewers actually wanted us to say there are psychologists, psychotherapy treat people, that memories are embodied and you need to be aware of avoiding overlaps. Okay? So that means don't jump into an area that you don't know about, but be aware that sometimes you're getting that response pretty much you're getting into someone hidden state stuff that is there in the background. Just leave it alone, please. That's the way at least I see the world around me is like don't sort of start the process that you don't want to or if you don't, if you do, then go and see someone.
4256940	4258920	123	A	0.49671	1:10:56	6	Or sorry, Ian. And then blue.
4263180	4282608	124	B	0.99	1:11:03	47	Oh, it's okay. I didn't have my hand up. So over to blue. OK, blue, go for it. So it's interesting, and I don't know if in your work as an osteopath, but there's many layers I found through working emotionally, physically on myself through my life.
4282694	4302072	125	F	0.99997	1:11:22	55	It's like peeling an onion, right? And so as you go through, it's interesting that all this stuff resurfaces and even physical trauma remains there. Like you stub your pinky toe. You stub your pinky toe 25 times, 35 times, 255 times, who knows how many times, right? It depends on how clumsy you are.
4302206	4339232	126	F	1.0	1:11:42	99	But your pinky toe remembers being stubbed. It has maybe like a hyper response because it's been stubbed so many times, because it's whatever that's its little job in life is to be stubbed, I think. But it's interesting that you kind of have to open it up to do the work. And I wonder what kind of synchronous work there is. I know that there are some people that deal with physical and emotional trauma and I know physical trauma can be a manifestation of emotional trauma and you can have emotional trauma based on your physical trauma.
4339296	4361320	127	F	0.99999	1:12:19	55	So again, it's like this bi directional circular loop and I wonder what the training is in osteopathy to deal with emotional trauma that may come up or what kind of are there people that do integrative practices? Like you have to be an osteopath and then maybe you do your residency as a psychiatrist?
4363360	4417672	128	F	0.99969	1:12:43	116	Can you get it all out if you have some kind of linked problem that's both physical and emotional? Thank you, George. Then Ian. Okay, so the model in terms of therapeutic alliance and synchrony and using touch if we use to the whole world of healthcare practice could argue that in a world of psychotherapy for example mind body kind of stuff the person would be sort of equipped with the tools to explore, to enable them to open up, to start the process. And being able to deal with that the paper as a kind of a generic kind of model that could apply as an umbrella to a number of areas of practice.
4417816	4474544	129	C	1.0	1:13:37	117	For sure, we can do that and no problem. If we think specifically about manual therapy and specifically about osteopathy, then you've got two worlds, the American world of osteopathic medicine, where osteopathic medicine is medicine. And there are osteopaths in the US who are psychiatrists as well. And in that case, yes, that person would be ideally suited to be able to explore that, to do that, to kind of start that process of care, actually using both their competences as a psychiatrist and their competences as also manual therapist as a hands on kind of a practitioner. In other countries, osteopaths are primarily kind of manual therapists, if you want to call it that way.
4474582	4523636	130	C	0.99628	1:14:34	100	Although osteopaths don't like being called manual therapists, but primarily use manual therapy primarily in musculoskeletal care, but other areas of practice. And we start seeing a number of practitioners going down the route of like physiotherapists using what is called a psychologically informed type of practice. And that typically involves some additional training in counseling or some additional training in some CBT like kind of approaches. Like, for example, something like acceptance and commitment therapy, for example. So stuff that actually combined with hands on potentiates the effect of the treatment that the hands on alone would not achieve.
4523688	4580444	131	C	1.0	1:15:23	118	But when you come from the two kind of two different angles meeting in the middle and providing a more robust package of care you can get better results. Because the training as a preregistration level is very basic to enable you to recognize that there are things that need a referral to another practitioner even those that practice a psychologically informed type of practice. Like several physiotherapists have developed a kind of a traffic light system where clearly there are stuff on the yellow that anxiety is associated with pain and so on. That's okay, you can deal with that. There's some stuff kind of in the orange that you have to be a little bit careful.
4580492	4628640	132	C	1.0	1:16:20	126	And there are clearly stuff PTSDs and so on, where it's a no go zone because you can dive in. And then you don't know if you're going to come back okay kind of thing. So that is typically a referral to another practitioner. Having said that, I think there are opportunities for collaborative work where the two together can actually provide a much better service to a person that's simply relying on one practitioner that can do everything. I think that sometimes exploring stuff through the physical body, the embodied self opens the doors for stuff to be explored at other elements of the self when the body is a little bit more prepared to deal with stuff and people maybe are prepared to talk.
4628790	4660730	133	C	0.99999	1:17:08	81	Sometimes you see that in cases of childhood abuse and so on. Kind of had some stuff that felt good, some hands on work, even the massage and the person felt a bit more confident in themselves and they were prepared then let's have a chat. And they were not prepared to sort of go to talking therapy straight away because there was too much going on in there. Kind of invited itself. The sirens go off when certain things happen.
4661520	4663580	134	C	0.94797	1:17:41	2	Exactly. Ian.
4666320	4708330	135	B	0.71	1:17:46	106	Yes. So just sort of picking up on the points from George and the question from yeah really totally agree that it's not the job of an untrained manual therapist to kind of aim to open a can of worms of something that especially if it's not five minutes before the end of a session, and then you kind of say, okay, I want to see you later, see you next week, and got another client now, and that's definitely not a good idea. However, as you said, George, sometimes people will come and they'll want to offer things and they'll want to talk about stuff.
4710380	4726380	136	B	0.99	1:18:30	43	And what I was thinking about Blue as you were asking about sort of the different combinations of approaches. I don't know if George and Zoe or any of you are familiar with David Bocelli's work on tre trauma release or tension release.
4729360	4788656	137	B	0.89	1:18:49	131	You know, he doesn't really go into the story. So it's not kind of psychoanalytical or unraveling the stories of people's past. But he has methods for inducing kind of what I think is myofascial and what it looks like myofascial unwinding. So sometimes it's tremoring and so it's sort of I don't think he necessarily uses touch in the beginning, but I guess what I'm thinking is that there are ways that if the ways of offering clients opportunities to unravel the bodily trapped or the stuff that's held in the body where they don't have to verbalize it if they don't want to. But the inroad is to induce some kind of letting go, which maybe is what all manual therapy is about, to a greater or lesser degree.
4788688	4805770	138	B	1.0	1:19:48	51	But his examples are quite dramatic. People will be making big movements that seemingly are uncontrolled but if you ask them to stop at any time, they can stop. They can bring it into voluntary. But there seems to be a really big updating of some generative model through this process.
4809020	4838592	139	B	1.0	1:20:09	70	Yeah, they're my thoughts. Thank you. I'm going to return to our previous complex causation network. Now, it's smaller because we're abstracting away from the details and think about, like, what are some active inference questions that come to mind and how could we look at this differently than, for example, just a structural equation model that's fit from many empirical studies? And so here's Figure 4.3 from the textbook.
4838736	4870792	140	A	1.0	1:20:38	79	And this is a partially observable Markov decision process. And it's come up in other papers and live streams, so we won't go into too much details. But the kinds of things that we might want to ask are, like, what variables are latent states or observable in general? And then in the specific case, for example, maybe there's a total, absolutely perfect association between hippocampus volume and some other clinical outcome. And so hippocampus volume conceptually is observable.
4870856	4897348	141	A	1.0	1:21:10	65	It could be observed. But in that exact patient's case, it may not be an observable in that relationship. So variables can be observable in one context and latent in another context. So that might speak to evidence based grounding where like, okay, we don't know what somebody's blood level of this is, what's the most informative thing to do? Maybe we can measure it.
4897434	4916828	142	A	1.0	1:21:37	41	And then that ties their measurements into other observables. So that's one question. What are observables and what are latent variables? What variables do we have causal influence on? What affordances exist that might have intervening influence on some unobserved state?
4916914	4942884	143	A	0.66114	1:21:56	66	So here's, like, pi the policy selection and then the way that the hidden state is changing through time. That's what the affordances are about. Influencing the hidden state is the true temperature of the room. The thermometer is the observed value. And then taking an action like turning on the air conditioning is about intervening in the hidden state such that other observables are seen.
4943082	4970732	144	A	1.0	1:22:23	65	And then we talked also about like, in what ways can we change the generative model? So here's the policy selection of the practitioner. And then in the interface, it's like, it's meeting with the observations of the patient. The actions of the practitioner, what they say and what they do are received as observations. And that's kind of this dyad active that we've seen.
4970786	5026370	145	A	0.99995	1:22:50	127	So rather than the one entity navigating and sense making in the world, the joint sense making features, this interface where the policy selections on one and their thinking through other minds, their inference on the generative model of the other is what is being intervened in. How can we change the generative model, the cognitive models? How can we change the generative process? Could there be something welcoming on the door of the room that is a modification of the niche or some other design choice that helps scaffold this therapeutic niche? And yeah, what policies can be taken from the toolkit that is afforded in that moment based upon the training and the equipment available and so on, that influence what to result in what.
5027460	5076620	146	A	1.0	1:23:47	98	And that kind of comes back to this synchrony for what question? Just achieving synchrony is like a sort of undirected hypnosis or undirected sort of I don't know, it's just sort of like this vegetative propagation of coordination that would only coincidentally be functional. So having a functional outcome in mind, then there can be a working backwards, like well, what observations are we looking for? And then what hidden states give rise to those observations? And what policies exist that intervene in those hidden states and in the dynamics of how they change, recognizing their complexity?
5076780	5096950	147	A	0.9999	1:24:36	35	So those would just be a few active inference variables and approaches that are being invoked here conversationally. However, the kinds of models and the empirical data to take it further are being sketched out.
5100060	5131244	148	A	0.99828	1:25:00	73	Well, it's going very fast and we're in kind of the home stretch. So what would anyone like to look at or turn to? We have a few other questions that previously had been raised that we didn't perhaps get to. Some of them are written here, so anything that people see here that they're interested in or any other topic. And then also just how are we coming out of this dot?
5131292	5140580	149	A	0.49	1:25:31	22	Two what will be different in our action as we are engaged in this area, of course, from many different perspectives. George.
5143800	5154330	150	C	1.0	1:25:43	24	I loved your kind of proposal, your summary of all those active inference questions. In fact, there's a structure for paper in it, right?
5157260	5182770	151	C	1.0	1:25:57	61	It can take us down the road, even just sort of looking at some computational stuff. So creating some kind of a framework. Yeah, so I very much like it. I think there is a sort of challenge and what are the latents and observables and so on to define those kind of things? That needs a little bit of thinking.
5185460	5230256	152	C	1.0	1:26:25	85	The other stuff, I think, as you said, probably working backwards would sort of becomes easier, isn't it? It is about hands on with reassurance and so on. If that's sort of what the policy and so on and what we observed back at the beginning, I think it would be fascinating. I think in terms of the bio behavioral kind of element of synchrony, there's clearly changes in breathing, changes in probably heart rate variability and so on. That would be interesting to understand.
5230438	5271324	153	C	1.0	1:27:10	90	Is that a sign that the system is sort of starting, changing the process? It talked about the thing, maybe something in the door of the room. A couple of years ago when I was practicing in another country for quite a few months, I used to use a lot of classical music and opera and so on. And that was actually a tremendously effective way of creating an environment where the person sort of actually a form of inducing that synchrony. I'm treating I'm kind of doing this stuff.
5271362	5309144	154	C	1.0	1:27:51	97	I don't need to talk that much. I'm kind of just go with the sensations, go with the music. And I felt that actually that was a very good way as a process of start changing the generative model. So there is the stuff, as we kind of proposed on one of the recent papers, the stuff that you can implement. So if you doing the Tactile, the touch based intervention and use forms of language sometimes to get the person to visualize what you're doing, for example, I'm doing this and I'm trying to achieve that.
5309182	5361332	155	C	1.0	1:28:29	126	And you know that the person is even, like, interceptively robust enough to let you explore the inner sensations to situations as you're probably doing some work. And you realize by sort of predicting their internal states that they're just focusing too much and giving too much attention to stuff which is actually not useful, where you can just say, oh, you know what? Like we said in the paper, I have a new dog. And where does the dog come from? But a dog in that sense is a way of sort of breaking down that attention to what you're doing to sort of say oh, okay, so you're continuing, there's still the sensory stimulation, there is still that sensory evidence arriving to the system.
5361406	5415870	156	C	1.0	1:29:21	112	But actually you start changing a little bit, you're flattening a little bit of the sensory state by sort of zeroing things and then maybe those sensations that come in potentially kind of change some stuff. So yeah, I think at this level that's for sure some stuff to do. I think it's an interesting thing that actually started being explored now with Ted Kapchuk lab in Harvard around Acupuncture, which know looking at synchrony as well with hyperscanning techniques and kind of finding that actually successful in terms of the intervention is associated again, what synchrony. So kind of a body of evidence sort of building up, I think quite nice.
5419200	5508372	157	A	1.0	1:30:19	189	One thought on the free energy minimizing and ML Don and several others were discussing in the chat about our biological systems truly finding global minima. And so it's a big question, but just to give one thought on it is the free energy is calculated for a given policy sequence of actions in terms of how informative that sequence of actions is expected to be and how useful that sequence of action is supposed to be expected to be. And so different action pathways are evaluated based upon their ability to reduce uncertainty or provide direct value. And so if we can just maybe there's multiple things that have value in the therapeutic alliance, but one for the generative model of the practitioner might be like to reduce a number on a pain survey that would be useful and then there might be multiple policies and maybe adequacy is good enough. And if the pathways are to some balance or shifting balance of informative and useful, either reducing pain or helping understand how to reduce pain, then navigating and shifting policies is something that can be done adaptively.
5508436	5548390	158	A	1.0	1:31:48	100	And then in contrast, the policies that might want to be disfavored would be like the ones that are adding confusion, reducing clarity of sense making or increasing pain. And that's not to say that there's not moments where transiently surprise does increase or pain does increase, but that is part of a policy like, I'm going to touch this place, that might transiently increase pain, but that might be an informative action that in an extended timeline is part of a free energy minimizing trajectory. And so what is the horizon and so on. George and then anyone else?
5552140	5581324	159	C	0.93477	1:32:32	73	That thing sort of modifying pain, modifying symptoms. It's quite an interesting thing because for example, at least in my profession, there's this idea that we don't treat the symptoms, we treat the cause of the problem. Okay, so pain is just the symptoms, nothing to worry about. But from this perspective, actually changing symptoms, reducing symptoms is actually an important thing, quite an important thing. Particularly if you're thinking about chronic conditions.
5581372	5617150	160	C	0.99999	1:33:01	96	If you start making the person start feeling a little bit better, then you probably start changing the whole process. If you don't change anything, how is the person going to engage in that? If actually you can continue saying you're moving much better, your function is so much better, but actually the person says, you know what, but pine hasn't reduced at all. I'm still in agony. I think going a little bit with small things at that level are quite important in the greater scheme of things in terms of changing the generative model.
5618400	5652840	161	C	0.99987	1:33:38	77	So it is clearly a fundamental bit of the jigsaw. And it's the same as you said, informing, for example, this might be uncomfortable, but in fact is important in kind of achieving something. So the same way some patients tell you it is painful, but it's a good pain. So again, what's the value of the good pain is, the reward is a sort of anticipation that this will lead to a positive change. Thank you.
5652910	5653720	162	A	0.93945	1:34:12	1	Zoe?
5657260	5700468	163	E	1.0	1:34:17	93	Yeah, I think George just kind of touched upon what I was going to know. Sometimes patients I know, I have patients that come to a session and they expect it to be painful. I mean, a lot of people expect that at some point they might get that sort of, quote, good pain where they almost want to feel like something's happening. And whether that feedback is kind of pain or something, that's kind of reassuring. I know patients, especially with sort of osteopathic, manipulative sort of treatment, they want the click.
5700634	5739876	164	E	1.0	1:35:00	107	If someone manipulates them, they come in and go, oh, I just want you to click me. And, you know, the research shows that not necessarily you need that sound, but that feedback that they sort of want. They kind of want some people, they expect if you do a hard, sort of a more firm massage, they feel like they're, I don't know, getting their money's worth or they're getting more sort of treatment than if they want. They kind of want that feedback to say, yeah, you're in the right place, and I get that a lot. So I think pain is an interesting one.
5739898	5781584	165	E	0.76	1:35:39	122	I think the biosynchrony that we get and we go upon, whether it is the patient's heart rate, their breathing changes, you see their facial expression changes or the muscle tightens up nearby, you kind of go on that. And I think it's what they expect to get from treatment. Not every patient is going to come in and go, yeah, I want to be in less pain. That might not be their ultimate goal. Obviously they're not going to say no to it, but they might really just want to be able to pick their kid up or go to sleep with just being able to go to sleep, not being in pain or not waking up or something like that.
5781622	5809796	166	E	0.99968	1:36:21	70	So I think it's not yes, we can clinically, it's not so simple as something that we can measure imperatively. It might be something that a goal to that patient is more important than if their pain is less or if they're moving better or oh, well, yeah, if we had the technology to say, look. Oh, look, your heart. Rate is lower. Or this means that you're more efficient.
5809908	5839176	167	E	0.98268	1:36:49	83	You're saving free energy because you're not expending on your pain. Or you're more efficient, so you'll have more energy to do this. Now that you're doing this better, they may not care. They may just want to be able to pick their kid up and not be in pain. So I think what we're measuring, I think, will be very individual to the patient and it might not be something that is necessarily useful in terms of research that we can quantify.
5839308	5847780	168	E	0.58	1:37:19	16	It just might be that goal that's not always sort of empirical. Thank you, Zoe. Ian.
5851980	5874044	169	B	0.80129	1:37:31	58	Thanks. Thanks, all. And, yeah, just as you were saying that, Zoe, you said at the beginning, I think the intention behind it all is to help them. And I'm just thinking of a scenario or some scenarios of when agreeing on the goals is so important. So I'm thinking short term goals and long term goals here.
5874082	5932720	170	B	0.99977	1:37:54	142	So clients who are maybe endurance runners, and they want to do six ultramarathons a year and they come to you because their calves are hurting, so your immediate goal is to reduce the pain in their calves so they can make the ultramarathon at the end of the month. But then if I'm aware as a therapist that there's a link between endurance running and developing arrhythmias, heart arrhythmias, for example, and I see this person is very anxious about their goals to the point where it's almost like they need it rather than it's a pleasure. As such, then if I disagree with their goal, are we am I true? You know, and saying, actually, maybe four ultramarathons a year would be enough for you. Am I just enabling this drive by relieving your calf pain in the short term?
5933060	5986496	171	B	0.99753	1:38:53	118	So I think agreeing on those more broader life goals or referring to someone else if I don't agree with that, that's more of an ethical issue. But it came to mind as we were talking there. Yeah, that reminds me of the kind of performances that we might see in the Olympics or the medical care that might happen on the sideline of a game where somebody has been injured, but they're going to continue doing it almost in a way that is rapidly degrading potentially the future weeks of their health. And then that's the ethical challenge or the decision making challenge. Like is it worth them to hobble across the finish line with an injury?
5986528	6019640	172	A	0.99971	1:39:46	66	That every step is just deteriorating the injury, but then being consistent with a belief that one is a finisher or even a signal to those who are watching. There's so many complex phenomena at that level. Those are very interesting questions. Wow. So we're towards the end here, I guess for the authors and for anyone else, we can give some of our last thoughts.
6019720	6026930	173	A	0.99977	1:40:19	14	What are some of your next directions for this line of research and application?
6031380	6046070	174	C	0.99859	1:40:31	25	Okay, well, first of all, as last time was a fascinating discussion, think kind of learning a lot from this kind of interaction. For sure.
6048200	6114940	175	C	0.99977	1:40:48	117	Within this we sort of got some stuff done published in the musculoskeletal side of things. We have another paper to be submitted very soon, the next week or so, the same topic, but in pediatrics. And there's the bulk of the other stuff building up. I think what we want to achieve now is to start testing some of these ideas kind of empirically using different methods from qualitative kind of phenomenological type of approaches, trying to understand really what's going on to more sort of NeuroBio stuff. Kind of along the lines of looking at for example, some markers of bio behavioral synchrony like for example, physiological changes in both the practitioner and the patient.
6115280	6158984	176	C	0.99808	1:41:55	87	Bearing in mind some of this stuff. It is a bit more challenging to achieve because whereas for example, in the field of psychotherapy, the person practitioner is typically sitting down, the guy doing manual therapy is moving around. So therefore the heart rate is not going to be exactly the same but looking at what can be done and creating some models as well. So the idea around computational stuff also makes sense to test some of the ideas. This is work that is building up.
6159022	6202376	177	C	0.99968	1:42:39	84	So we very much look forward to kind of people getting in touch, bouncing off ideas from each other, kind of looking at how we can move forward with this. It's not osteopathic specific is more than that. I think at least it can be manual therapy more broadening along those lines. You can look at sort of the role of some of this stuff in chronic conditions, not just pain, but other persistent physical symptoms and so on. So that's where we are.
6202478	6209560	178	C	0.93336	1:43:22	19	It's time now to start kind of testing some of this stuff for sure and stop writing theoretical papers.
6212160	6214940	179	C	0.74711	1:43:32	2	Cool. Zoe?
6218480	6222110	180	E	1.0	1:43:38	6	Yeah, sort of what George said.
6226180	6285744	181	E	0.99236	1:43:46	96	We've had one paper accepted for MSK, so hopefully that will come out for everyone to read soon. What is MSK. We've got one waiting, so for more orthopedic general musculoskeletal muscle muscle and bones kind of patients and then the pediatrics one is almost ready to submit. And then, yeah, I guess we'll be looking towards seeing where it goes and what we can sort of empirically prove from all the theories that are kind of circulating and going from there. But hopefully discussions like what everyone said now will give everyone more ideas to.
6285782	6302952	182	D	0.9985	1:44:45	28	Sort of. Where we're going or where we could go, and different ways to apply the principles and the frameworks that we've suggested so far. Awesome. George? Yeah.
6303006	6373230	183	C	0.8342	1:45:03	146	Just on the pediatrics, we actually have one of the first lines to start exploring is synchrony between mother, baby and practitioner. Starting with not sure if you're going to we've been doing a bit of work around the effect of touch on premature babies. So we have those collaborations with hospitals in Italy would enable us to do some of that stuff. But we sort of start looking also looking at this whole concept of synchrony on a triadic kind of thing so the baby, the practitioner and the mother and see if actually if we find that the synchrony actually between mother and baby is a marker of for example, the baby would be some markers of autonomic change, changes in autonomic arousal, for example. Like we observed, for example, the effect of effective touch, gentle touch on the baby sat and so on.
6373840	6375260	184	A	0.99919	1:46:13	3	Thank you, Ian.
6378980	6443030	185	B	0.99887	1:46:18	133	George, just as you were saying about the challenge of a practitioner being moving whilst during a manual therapy session and I'm sort of aware of how that does lead to some difficulties, especially with the PPG sort of measurement of heart rate variability. I heard just an idea I heard about, I don't know if you've come across it a wearable ECG that it's aimed at increasing respiratory sinus arrhythmia. It vibrates and it stimulates the person, catches them at the top of their outbreath and it's designed to actually be used whilst you're walking around in everyday life. So I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity there because it's designed to A, increase RSA and B to be used whilst moving. That might be an interesting piece of kit to use.
6444840	6472110	186	C	0.89	1:47:24	50	Yeah, absolutely. Cool. Blue or would anyone else like any comments? I just want to give a final thought. So something that I'm going to be thinking about for, I don't know, whoever knows how long is this idea of the emotional and physical body in terms of reference point.
6472640	6513630	187	F	0.99588	1:47:52	79	Right, so we studied in, I think, Live Stream 40, the FEP for Generic Quantum Systems, and it talked about how the FEP drives entanglement and in this way, when there's perfect learning, there's this overlapping of the reference point. So I just wonder, how can an emotional body and a physical body be driven toward a more overlapping reference frame when those things are so fundamentally different? So I'm going to be thinking about that. Cool. Very cool.
6515600	6543236	188	A	0.99852	1:48:35	57	All right, well, thank you for this excellent two. That concludes 44 and really appreciated the authors joining. And Blue, thank you for joining Ian, also for contributing so much with the dot zero. And everyone is welcome back to give us updates on their learning and application on this very important area. So thanks again, everybody.
6543338	6548288	189	A	0.99997	1:49:03	9	See you later. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye.
