"Speaker 1","00;00;32;21","00;00;57;14","Hello and welcome everyone. It's May 18th. 20, 22 and we are in active flight live stream number 44.1 on the therapeutic alliance as active inference the role of therapeutic touch in synchrony. Welcome to the Active Lab We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this slide."
"Speaker 1","00;00;58;06","00;01;35;02","This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for livestreams so if you want to learn more about live streams or any of the other projects that are happening in the active lab, head over to Active Inference dot org OK, today we're in Livestream number 44.1, and we are learning and discussing around this paper Therapeutic Alliance as active inference by McPartlin, certainly Kristen and SS."
"Speaker 1","00;01;35;11","00;02;14;03","And we're really honored and appreciative to have a bunch of authors joining us today and also Ian and Ian. I did a zero last week, so for any context one might want to check out the dot zero. Otherwise in the dot one today and in the dot to next week, we're going to open up and develop threads and have the opportunity to address any questions that people are having in the live chat or submitted to us otherwise and just take notes and have spontaneity and see where this goes because it's a really exciting area of research."
"Speaker 1","00;02;14;12","00;02;43;14","So we're just going to start with that all. Say hello and then pass to Ian and then we'll hear from the authors with any context. So I'm a researcher in California and was very interested in this integration of a lot of perspectives from like the ecological and the developmental and kind of bringing it towards practice, which I hope we can continue discussion around."
"Speaker 1","00;02;43;14","00;02;44;25","And I'll pass it to Ian."
"Speaker 2","00;02;49;25","00;03;17;29","Thank you, Daniel. So my name's Ian. I am based in England. I work as a hands on manual therapist. I have a background in clinical and surgical sciences, but also do a little bit of research now around the topic of interception. And this is where the work of these authors caught my attention. The whole series actually on activism and active inference."
"Speaker 2","00;03;17;29","00;03;54;23","It's kind of where I've arrived at in the last year and I'm interested in both how we talk about these ideas to patients. So if in service of helping them update the meaning, they sort of give to the situation therein. And also from a research point of view, you know, some how how we might be able to drive forward some new questions in research around health Thank you."
"Speaker 2","00;03;54;23","00;03;59;09","Over to whoever's next OK."
"Speaker 3","00;04;00;05","00;04;39;23","So I'm sure, yes, there is I'm based between Malta and Italy. I'm an osteopath, so research so my main interests are on the things we're talking about here today. So inactive is active in Friends, the sort of management of of of chronic pain and complexity in clinical practice. A bit of background apart from from osteopathy. My PhD was exploring the role of multi-sensory integration in during our patient in osteopathy you know, several moons ago."
"Speaker 3","00;04;39;23","00;04;59;05","So that's, that was my sort of early dove into this kind of world back in the sort of late 2000 years when people start talking about Bayesian models to explain multi-sensory integration and so on. So is where we're kind of things start from."
"Speaker 4","00;05;03;17","00;06;00;29","Hi, I'm Francesco, Italian, based in Italy, and thanks Dunant and Ian for leading these interesting, open, interesting livestream. I'm an Guinea Nostra about so hands on treatment and also neuroscientist. So my main interest is in exploring effects of man therapies within the the the concept of interception and the autonomic nervous system effects That was my basically my my main stream line in the during my Ph.D. and then we George, we, we explore that the active inference and active is in the last couple of years."
"Speaker 4","00;06;01;11","00;06;36;11","And so and we trying to also apply in the context of therapeutic alliance and different in different age groups. So starting from the neonates pre terms where actually we have also a big choir, quite a strong background and I need to order persistent physical symptoms and also in the other age groups so that as the so I'm just divided into the clinical part, then the and the research activities."
"Speaker 1","00;06;39;06","00;06;40;20","Thank you so."
"Speaker 5","00;06;45;05","00;07;16;12","Hi, I'm Zoe. I'm the primary author on this paper. Again, I am a osteopath and this is my first paper that I've published. I originally started doing a little bit of research on chronic pain on how it affects autonomic. A long time ago, and then about two years ago, I reconnected with George on his act, inference and Interceptors ideas."
"Speaker 5","00;07;17;04","00;07;53;09","And since then, we've kind of gone from that. And this paper was published. We focus as an expert on mainly touch base. And so I wanted to do a paper based on how touch affects things and kind of have a little bit more of the neuroscience behind what we do. So that's an active imprint. Seemed the perfect way to try and justify things that maybe we as or stressful money therapists maybe feel but haven't been able to put down empirically on paper."
"Speaker 5","00;07;53;19","00;07;56;23","So that's how the the paper the kind of started about."
"Speaker 1","00;07;58;19","00;08;29;08","Awesome. So again, anyone in the live chat or anyone here can just raise their hand or ask a question but let's just jump in right there. Like that's really interesting about using active inference for formalizing some of the intuitions and experiences that might be felt during the clinical setting. So what is the clinical setting that you are engaged in or focusing on?"
"Speaker 1","00;08;29;19","00;08;42;22","And then what was that process of recognizing some experience? And then how does active inference fit in with formalizing that Oh."
"Speaker 3","00;08;44;15","00;09;10;09","Sure. So actually, you know, a little bit of what I mentioned before, the sort of early journey started with try to explore actually what we what we do as osteopath. One of the things we do as manual therapists, one of the things we do is we first there's a kind of the big claims about what what we can do and what we can feel."
"Speaker 3","00;09;10;23","00;09;43;26","And almost like having this sort of magical sort of ability to to recognize what's wrong with the patient. And that was always based around this idea that, you know, manual therapists or stupids have superior abilities to feel for things. You know, palpation is really the big thing. And based on on a kind of paradigm that's, you know, a little bit of old school biometrically based, biomechanically based that, you know, dysfunction altered mobility, for example, equals pain equals problem."
"Speaker 3","00;09;43;26","00;10;08;22","And of course, you know, as the knowledge in the field of brain science evolved, we we started realizing that that's not the case, you know, because, you know, what happens with chronic pain these days no longer a tissue dysfunction in lots of cases, but base pain. So clearly it becomes extremely difficult to find things and find things that actually are reliable And that's what the reliability is, is an observation."
"Speaker 3","00;10;08;22","00;10;31;27","And that's been one of the big debates in the medical therapy world, which is we cannot reliably find what we claim we can find. So for typically poor interoperate, the reliability to people cannot agree on things. And including also very poor interest operate the reliability. If I test one thing on the test that I will not find the same thing."
"Speaker 3","00;10;32;11","00;11;03;09","And of course, you know, this is the kind of, you know, some some important things to take into account. If the patient has a real pathology, for example, a real joint restricts restriction of movement, for example, associated with severe arthritis, then, you know, one should find something. You know, it's clearly there is is objective. But what happens in most of the patients is what we claim to find are things that are very qualitative in nature, very subjective."
"Speaker 3","00;11;03;09","00;11;44;00","So so the initial kind of journey was really to try to understand really what's going on and hence the idea of exploring things from a kind of multi-sensory perspective. Clearly what we find or what we rely as in the hands, it's not simply the haptic system of that or you know, somatosensory system is a multi-sensory experience. You know, we see, we observe, we touch, we change, we listen, and that creates straight away an environment where there's so many variables that becomes extremely hard to say yeah, for sure."
"Speaker 3","00;11;44;18","00;12;16;20","This is what I find. So, you know, you, you can have people criticizing for this on the sake of, for the sake of criticizing or saying everything is a kind of it's an illusion to other people claiming no, it's for sure it's true. And I think, you know, we need to understand that actually probably we sitting in between and more than ten years ago now, I remember when I kind of started presenting some of the you know, some of the research findings to that to my profession and implied the idea that actually palpation is a construct of the brain."
"Speaker 3","00;12;16;20","00;12;34;05","People got a little bit of. Yeah, no, no. Can't be really because, you know, how can you say that the hand is such a powerful thing? You know, we we feel things from a philosophical perspective. People would talking about, you know, the hand is an extension of the brain. So, you know, clinical reasoning, it kind of continues through."
"Speaker 3","00;12;34;15","00;12;59;00","You know, we gathering we gather sensory evidence by listening, by observing the patient, by arguably using most of the senses, including smell, because I don't think we taste our patients, but smell for sure. You know, there are cases where a strong smell equals pathology. So we get that information, we are bombarded with that information and we try to make some sense of it."
"Speaker 3","00;12;59;16","00;13;27;15","And, you know, it's down to the clinical reasoning. So I think that fits nicely now with with new ideas of, you know, along the lines of active inference because it's about, you know, active inference claims about how we construct our own sensorium, you know, how we sort of integrate information, change things, proactively interact and so on. Exactly. What we do when we assess a patient, we touch, we feel, we get a reaction from the patient."
"Speaker 3","00;13;27;15","00;13;54;11","Either, you know, that hurts or I don't like being touched or actually feels very nice. So there's a number of things that straight away are going to happen that immediately, one can argue changes the outcome. So it's no longer you know, what I felt. Now the second guy is going to feel exactly the same thing. I don't think that is possible unless, of course, if you've got this, there's a fuzed vertebrae between, let's say C three and C four."
"Speaker 3","00;13;54;25","00;14;30;08","Yes, we should feel the same thing because objectively there is there is a problem there. But otherwise, you know, what we tend to find how we interact that changes the whole kind of environment and that I think, you know, active inference, it's kind of a nice framework to start exploring things. And rather than just being on the on the negative side is actually to try and go a step further and try to understand some of the dilemmas from a different perspective, from a different angle without saying, you know, this justifies now everything we do."
"Speaker 3","00;14;30;19","00;14;39;05","Far from that but actually try to understand some more that some of the difficulty, some of the tension yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;14;40;02","00;15;18;05","May I go on that definitely agree with what George just said. And what I would like to add to the discussion table is that actually we started also from an additional point there was the fact that two additional points. So the first one is that apparently old man was an old man watch therapies as an outcome. So it's got a positive outcomes for the patients so that can be an osteopathic, can be a physiotherapist, it could be chiropractor, it could be any a massage therapist."
"Speaker 4","00;15;18;05","00;15;47;17","So apparently the uniqueness of each kind of man was therapist is a kind of flatten by the the relationship that the man must have is can establish with the patient. So giving therefore the importance of the day type of relationship into with the with the with the patient then might also play a big role in the clinic positive clinical outcome effects."
"Speaker 4","00;15;48;14","00;16;35;25","And the second is also related to the fact that that the based on quantitative quantitative research, the elements that actually pop up is that some in some cases and more than some cases, the the specific application of those two party treatment might also be effective. And with the clinical effectiveness in across different age groups. So from treatments to the elderly to the two ordered sense on that actually opens a very good question in regards to the real effectiveness because actually we know that from science that that that that is not possible that we are going to have always positive effects otherwise we are going into publication bias."
"Speaker 4","00;16;35;25","00;17;32;02","So we are going to publish only the papers that actually are and are positive towards that. They kind of the kind of treatment so far so and indeed in this way that there might be therefore the, the need for a paradigm shift at the worse the has John said and mentioned from the biomechanical way and then modified by the and the beeps so the the psychological met and the bias the bias psychological model into something that actually might really take into account the environment that's in the in the him and these is also important because the evolution of the free energy principle and all the the elements within this content these contents actually take into"
"Speaker 4","00;17;32;02","00;18;04;13","account also elements then might from a computational point of view might take into account the relationship between people for example in Marcus blankets and the all the elements that actually are in contact between the practitioner and any medical practitioner in this case and the patient for for the sake of the the fact that actually we are touching patients and therefore AIDS is super powerful channels that alter with or without words."
"Speaker 4","00;18;04;13","00;18;34;01","My also they collide and drive information towards a specific and now the other elements I would like to introduce is the fact that sometimes happened that we consider the reliability as a integral liability within the man has got to be suspect in some way a big problem. But this problem is actually exactly the same for cardiologists for people in the doing ultrasound."
"Speaker 4","00;18;35;04","00;19;11;07","Why is that? Because actually it's the and was a paper a beautiful paper published in on BMJ probably ten years ago talking about the the kind of statistical measure that actually has been used for reliability studies that are being used. The decay coin saying that is one in intrinsic problem which coins came because actually it doesn't take into account what is the reality of the measurement of the the radiologists or the radiologist are measuring the ultrasound ultrasound specialist manual therapies and so on."
"Speaker 4","00;19;11;17","00;20;05;10","So it's been implied therefore that that time that kind of the reliability it's one of the most important measurement for reproducing and for generalizing the the will actually the treatment is is doing and we these framework actually we are trying to get out from this perspective because within the in the context of a therapeutic alliance and when actually we take into account where we where we look after patients, it's not just the fact that actually we can reproduce the treatment because the treatment is just one element of the plethora of the broad elements of the of the fate of the of the instruments and tools that the within the discussion we are applying."
"Speaker 4","00;20;05;19","00;20;38;19","So it's just a using like a funnel the fact that actually we need to reproduce the exactly that that kind of dysfunction or problems in the column. But the problem in the column might be also affected the way in which we establish a relationship with the patient. So and it goes and back in the days the BMJ paper was just a brilliant way of looking at the one of these main effects from a different perspective."
"Speaker 1","00;20;40;18","00;20;42;04","Thank you. Awesome. So we."
"Speaker 5","00;20;44;10","00;21;20;14","Yeah. So to add on to what George and Francesco said, this paper mainly focuses on more private practice than sort of a hospital setting. Obviously, it can. It's a framework, so it can be applied. But generally we're talking about more dyadic or traumatic relationships within clinic as as the setting. And we've primarily focused on manual therapy, but the theories of active inference and everything can be applied to others like psychotherapy and things like that as well, just to point that out."
"Speaker 5","00;21;20;14","00;21;45;21","But yes, like Francesco and George said, we're mainly using touch as sort of the vehicle, but there's a lot more that's going on sort of with the way that we communicate and the different aspects of like the bio psychosocial model, which now I'm sort of expanding upon. But there's a lot more to it than just the vehicle of touch to make therapeutic alliance."
"Speaker 5","00;21;46;09","00;22;26;09","I think the Therapeutic Alliance is interesting. There's a lot of research that's been done for a very long time on the therapeutic alliance itself, what it is and why it's important, but there's not actually that many theories to and sort of the neuroscience or things like active inference behind why it's important. All the research will tell you that you can get better clinical results and better relationships better trust with the patients, more adherence, lots of different positive effects of the therapeutic alliance, but not always sort of explaining how the Therapeutic Alliance works or how to best achieve it."
"Speaker 5","00;22;26;19","00;22;47;07","That's kind of not always expressed. So this is kind of a way that we've tried to quantify how to effect, to gather all the different parts of the that go on to create the therapeutic points in sort of one framework awesome."
"Speaker 1","00;22;47;11","00;22;54;25","A lot there. Ian, do you have any thing to add or ask the question yes."
"Speaker 2","00;22;54;25","00;23;23;11","Thank you. Well, lots of tantalizing stuff there. And what I really love is the openness of all of this question asking several sort of things from the paper that or topics in the paper I'd like to explore. But one thing that's coming out to me now is this role of the experts and the model of the expert that might be leading where things are synchronizing towards in the therapeutic alliance."
"Speaker 2","00;23;23;23","00;23;55;10","And so what I'm sort of in mind as I was hearing that is sometimes is it the patient that's the expert or allowing the patient to be the expert or taking turns and being the expert. So, you know, it might be the that the therapist says, oh, you know, based on my model, of my, you know, my past experience, my priors, my the palpation that we're doing now makes me think maybe it's the tightness in your tracks that's causing this pain."
"Speaker 2","00;23;55;19","00;24;17;22","But then actually, you know, the patient says, you know, takes on the role of the expert and says, based on my prize, actually, you know, I've often had side drops and it's never been a problem. And I've actually what I'm feeling is maybe nausea in my stomach because of this exam pressure. I've got more stress with my family members."
"Speaker 2","00;24;17;22","00;24;49;00","And then, you know, then there's another cycle of expert swapping over and explorations. So it's more of a exploration. The touch is helping with exploration of the models between the, you know, the co embodiment between the patient and the the practitioner. The other thing, you know, when you're talking about the machines in the hospital or the radiologists or the MRI scanner, I was thinking also about the, you know, the hand."
"Speaker 2","00;24;49;00","00;25;13;21","There's a machine and a blind person builds up that sensitivity to be able to read Braille. So they're palpating a piece of paper with Braille on it. And maybe it says John went to the shops and bought an apple, but the blind person would never, you know, look at that pattern and think that there's a person called John eating an apple inside the paper."
"Speaker 2","00;25;14;26","00;25;35;16","But they, you know, that the symbols that they're being created, that they feel that they'll see an image of an apple and John and maybe bring up feelings and emotions. And I just wonder if sometimes, you know, it's confusing the sensory input with the feelings and how do we overcome the feelings and the emotions and how do we overcome that?"
"Speaker 2","00;25;35;16","00;25;43;15","And, you know, don't confuse the moon with the finger pointing at it. So yeah, lots lots of lots of questions."
"Speaker 3","00;25;46;23","00;26;19;03","Please look OK, it's a very good question. By the way. I I think that the whole issue about taking turns, I think it's it should be the essence of it. One cannot argue that it's always the expert as a practitioner. If we do that, I think we end up in a situation where clinical practice relies on that expert, the top down kind of approach."
"Speaker 3","00;26;19;03","00;26;59;08","I know best because I'm a health care professional health care provider and therefore, you know, I know what's wrong with you. That's that's kind of the that's the way from the a model of person centered care. One expects really that practitioner and patient or as Zoe alluded to, the concept of a triad relationship where, for example, in pediatric care, there's a baby there in the conversation with the mother or the father, or sometimes in geriatric care, there's a conversation with the you know, with the for example, the daughter or the son or the older person and so on."
"Speaker 3","00;26;59;08","00;27;28;18","So that taking interns, I think there are clearly we need to think about the person is expert in their own body. And I personally tend to ask my patients, you know what, in your opinion, what do you think is wrong with you? You know, ultimately you are the expert in your own body. And clearly, if it's something kind of new, you know, the system becomes better detecting something that, you know, what's going on here, kind of, you know, something that requires some attention."
"Speaker 3","00;27;28;18","00;27;48;10","But clearly, when the when in cases, for example, of chronic pain, the system becomes extremely good relying on the that, you know, very strong generative model, too. So we are this is pretty much what always happens when I get stressed. You know, I typically gets, you know, start worrying about I start getting some butterflies in my tummy and so on."
"Speaker 3","00;27;48;10","00;28;06;21","And then from know from is just a cascade of events that ultimately leads to I had the X or my neck pain and so on. So I think, you know, clearly one cannot talk about, you know, the person, the practitioner being the expert. Having said that, there are times where clearly you need to play the role of the expert."
"Speaker 3","00;28;07;02","00;28;29;06","You know, I don't think we need to simply just to rely on the person on the patient because also that's why they consulting us. You know, if they if they also notice there is sometimes a little bit of, you know, uncertainty about what do you think is going on this thing about this beautiful, beautiful thing about clinical practice, about clinical uncertainty."
"Speaker 3","00;28;29;23","00;29;03;12","But humans hate uncertainty anyway. Our brains don't like uncertainty anyway. So will you want to know? Come on, stop. Stop talking about could we X, Y, and Z and just tell me what's going on? Because in the cases of complexity, that's what tends to generate that that sort of vicious circle where the guy goes to doctor Google then goes to the next practitioner and you you end up with a fascinating situation sometimes of patients becomes cognitively immune to any new explanations because hey, guess, you know, guess what?"
"Speaker 3","00;29;03;21","00;29;32;25","I've been talking to a lot of practitioners. Nobody knows what's wrong with me. And, you know, yes, but, you know, you're the expert. So it is a kind of something we need to manage, you know, very well and in a clever way. And I think that comes from creating the environment where listening observing a lot of what's not said but actually observed and things like that."
"Speaker 3","00;29;32;29","00;29;59;07","Body language is critical also to know when to when to chip in and say something, when to sometimes just shut down and let the whole think, let them talk or let them not saying anything and and and three, for example, say that that's part of it regarding the other stuff. And we can carry on with this pressure. The other guys will have fascinating ideas."
"Speaker 3","00;30;00;10","00;30;23;23","I think that the mental images are part of everything, you know you know, you're talking about, you know, the blind person reading Braille and so on, the early studies looking for some form of plasticity and v1 and so on. Even with congenitally blind people, they found that there was an element of self, possibly imagery. There's a road map."
"Speaker 3","00;30;23;23","00;30;45;24","So I don't think you can dissociate yourself from the images you create when you when you're navigating the world, when you're interacting with the world and the very strong kind of prior to what we're going to, you know, put my hand. But then of course that, that, that prior is going to bias the, you know, the incoming signal and it's going to match somehow."
"Speaker 3","00;30;45;25","00;30;50;09","Yes, of course, this is what it is. So images are damaging. We just need to cope with that."
"Speaker 4","00;30;52;07","00;31;22;10","What what that cannot to what just John said is that when observing someone in the I mean, in the clinical practice actually the one element might be to start understanding the generative models so that and understanding the generative model. It means that in addition to what George said, also how, for example, the body reacts to specific within a specific stimuli."
"Speaker 4","00;31;22;22","00;31;50;07","So also testing in the clinical practice, the generative model may also give us the idea on how the body may react from different stimuli to in, in, for example, combining different senses so that there might be so talking how the talking about, for example, the pain might change the general of eating the generative more that's in the body, for example."
"Speaker 4","00;31;50;07","00;32;22;21","So are the some parts getting tighter or more relaxed? What happened or for example, talking about or touching in specific areas how or moving the the body in a specific way, how those generative models might change. So and I think it's important in the in the role play that we that the patient and the practitioner are are are establishing during the therapeutic alliance."
"Speaker 4","00;32;22;21","00;33;00;20","And I think and we discussed that also with George then the right balance between the input giving the these role to the patient and to the practitioners. Also, it's important for establishing a good democratic you alliance. Why is that? Because actually the patient the patient as mentioned by Zoe in a way needs trust and trust may be also more minefield supplied by directionally so in the way that actually the patient coming into our clinical practice actually they are just giving us trust."
"Speaker 4","00;33;00;29","00;33;35;20","So they by by default to saying, OK, I'm coming to you because I trust you and because I think you can ask me so that it's a way of sharing trust. But on the other side, the clinician needs also to trust the patient about what he or she said or what he or she shared. And in these kind of dichotomous role play, I think it's important the the fact that the we need to understand and improve our ability of taking notes."
"Speaker 4","00;33;36;15","00;34;12;08","And from that obviously creating the right now the right environment. On the other on the other question, so the brain. Yes, and mental images are always there, but also mental images are not just visual because actually they can during the the secondary and and third and the I mean the in the evolution of the of the sensations and the feelings actually are not just compartmentalized into 11 image."
"Speaker 4","00;34;12;13","00;35;10;16","So the visual part because actually then are also characterized by other other elements that actually comes from experience but also comes from our expectations. So what we expect about those mental images in a in addition to that, there is a difference between just to just to pick up a very very interesting point raised by and that the one of the last paper from Carvajal Carvalho and Damasio published in 2000 at the end of 2021 actually day where they propose they intercept the nervous system and not just the interception as part of the the the different aspects of the the perception when actually they proposed that they also said that one actually we are going to"
"Speaker 4","00;35;10;16","00;35;39;02","have the exit perceptive map and intercepting mapping within the brain. It actually comes from from the senses from external senses but also from internal senses that in the reception after the process of integrating them into the the brain actually then and driving two things. The first one is feelings and the other the other one is drives. So the drives are the elements that actually are creating the substance is for creating therefore feelings."
"Speaker 4","00;35;39;12","00;36;26;25","So are the main elements that create therefore that they are the consciousness of what we are feeling so far. And and then in addition to that, when actually they are creating those elements that actually go back into an and the very nice special issue on intersection published on new on, on neuroscience. As always, last year where actually these concept, these model of interesting model was then modified into the homeostatic, inter homeostatic model where we get into account the fact that actually we have the interception is creating therefore the object of what we are feeling."
"Speaker 4","00;36;27;02","00;36;52;02","And then there is the subject that is the brain that actually are creating a perspective of what is the interception. And then there is the the, the final part is the mental imaging of our interest intersecting condition and therefore everything or therefore everything so the mental images might be also checked with the real what actually is coming from the tissue."
"Speaker 4","00;36;52;10","00;37;41;13","And this model is called model of forecasting. So creating therefore the elements between these two ideal. So the prior with the like and the likelihood just to talk about something in the from an AFP perspective. So in what creating what what is usually called the deepest theory. So I think that the mental images from one side, from the brain and from the brain side and the brain side are then checked with something that is the perception of the, the blind, the blind man that actually is touching the, the, the bar with the different spots and then they are focusing are the two elements in order to create a mental images that aids a kind of"
"Speaker 4","00;37;41;13","00;37;54;09","a rainbow. So with different colors, with different elements inside in order to understand what is behind that, that the story that he or she is reading."
"Speaker 1","00;37;57;06","00;38;21;01","Awesome again a lot to kind of pick up on. But just the way that the expectations play into what is palpated even just at a primary sensory level like anyone might be able to run their finger and detect a bump but then one level of expertize is that integration of well where should the bumps be or what does this mean in this person's clinical trajectory?"
"Speaker 1","00;38;21;10","00;38;56;15","And so it isn't just the information flowing into the person doing the perceiving, it's this active palpation and the integration of decades of the person's experience in the clinical setting and then the person's experience within that body. And then this externalized knowledge resource that we call like empirical grounding of science and evidence based medicine. And then all of that comes together in the focus of the therapeutic alliance and in the clinical setting."
"Speaker 1","00;38;56;15","00;39;39;01","That's like the runtime where all of these features intersect. And it's just very interesting how we're seeing a lot of these threads, like you use the Bayesian terminology, like the prior expectations, and then there's like the observations and then those are updated to form a posterior connecting that kind of quantitative approach to thinking about perception and cognition and then even action selection with the intermodal, it's like, well, even if only that to combine the past, present and future with multiple sensations and types of sensations and cognitive features like memory and preference, that would be excellent for acting to do."
"Speaker 1","00;39;39;11","00;40;15;06","And so that is really clear how it's presented in the paper and here, like what active inference is doing in this focused setting of that dyadic initially touch grounded relationship. But then, yeah, maybe there's another machine involved. Maybe somebody is using an x ray scanner or they're using a temperature like a thermometer. That just becomes another observation, another mere act of inference or adaptive active inference entity in this multi adic relationship."
"Speaker 1","00;40;15;28","00;40;17;07","So really interesting."
"Speaker 3","00;40;18;00","00;40;45;07","I think, if I can. Yeah, and 111 interesting thing to the debate is in recent times we've been observing quite a lot of the debate around what's, what's the value of palpation. You know, why, why bother? Because, you know, palpation is typically does have that connotation of biomedical kind of approach, you know, looking for something that is this functional, some pathology and so on."
"Speaker 3","00;40;45;07","00;41;17;18","I think one important thing is, you know, from this perspective I think would be important to take into account this patient still matters, even if it's just as a way of communicating, as a way of reassuring, as a way of of actually contributing to to the development of that therapeutic niche. So it's not just it is the sort of palpation not being a one way stream where I kind of look for what's wrong and I know what's wrong, but actually a dialog."
"Speaker 3","00;41;17;23","00;41;48;18","And that dialog can involve, of course, finding, you know, something that is, you know, not not good, you know, potentially even pathological to something that actually, you know, that, that, that exploration actually feels nice and comforts the patient and so on. So it is important to not just sort of be on a on a kind of very fundamentalist approach is either one thing or another, but actually try to kind of, you know, sit in the middle and try to to observe the two sides."
"Speaker 3","00;41;48;18","00;41;59;04","And even the tensions between the two sides, biometrically based or more sort of exploratory, more sort of niche construction, more sort of active influencing in nature."
"Speaker 1","00;42;00;29","00;42;01;11","Thank you."
"Speaker 3","00;42;01;24","00;42;03;00","Oh, sorry. Go ahead."
"Speaker 1","00;42;03;00","00;42;03;07","And."
"Speaker 5","00;42;06;18","00;42;31;17","And yeah, so I think back to the Expertize. I just wanted to add in about we brought up the concept of a birdsong and I think that's kind of how I see it as Expertize. I would never tell a patient personally that they are not the expertize in their pain. I don't know what they're feeling in that prize and different things that are going on to make them that pain."
"Speaker 5","00;42;31;17","00;43;03;16","I would always say that my patient is an expert in what they're feeling in their pain, whatever that may mean to them. I would say that they are the expert in that, but I think it's it's a birdsong, it's a taking here. It's it's, it's your sort of adapting what you think. Yes. Often as a practitioner, you're seen as more of the expert or your precision of maybe the physiological side of the condition is more precise than what your patient is."
"Speaker 5","00;43;03;16","00;43;29;27","They've obviously not 100% certain what's going on, otherwise maybe they wouldn't be coming. But I think it's definitely you adapt what you think based on what your patient is feeling and what they say. If you may think one thing and then they might tell you that actually, you know, they did this at the weekend or they felt this or this happened before and you kind of constantly change and take it."
"Speaker 5","00;43;29;27","00;43;52;26","You adapt your idea a little bit, you adapt their idea a little bit. The whole diagnostic process is generally not cut and dry. I mean, some situations are, but generally speaking, we do not know 100% what is going on in in a clinical space without machines or without sort of more in depth knowledge. We're going based on what we think in our opinion."
"Speaker 5","00;43;53;07","00;44;19;19","So I think it is definitely there's no strict hierarchy in terms of you are just the practitioners, just the expert. Yeah, we may be the expert on one aspect of the condition, but not necessarily the aspect on the whole big picture. Once you take into account all the other things that contribute to that pain, it's not just a physiological response."
"Speaker 5","00;44;20;05","00;44;47;01","Often it is the whole to be in sort of an overload of cases. You've got to have a lot more than just pain. There's a reason why behind it, there's a certain few things that probably have gone on for them to be in that situation. So I think it's, it's too simple to say that, that you're just the expert because you've done a degree and you're meant to know sort of the biomechanics or the physiology behind a certain condition."
"Speaker 5","00;44;47;29","00;45;18;01","As for what everyone was saying after towards the Braille and feeling touch is there's a lot of research to show that touches intercepted and affects the and activates the door, which gives you sort of that connection between what you're feeling your what sensory stimulus you're detecting and the feeling that you contribute to that. So that's why sometimes we have a touch and we feel it's pleasant."
"Speaker 5","00;45;19;02","00;45;54;16","It's that effect of the insula and how it is processed. And I think that's obviously dependent on the individual. Different people will have different things that will make certain things feel more pleasant. Or more painful depending on lots of different aspects. And so I think we touched upon sort of touch as a way of a good way of non nonverbal communication of expressing not just examining the condition, but also showing that you understand through sort of empathy and things like that."
"Speaker 5","00;45;54;16","00;46;21;03","So you you can use touch to show what you're feeling without saying. I think this is something that is very evident with the pandemic. I mean, there's a lot of people that went through a lot of hard times and the one thing they wanted to do, everything was just give the person they loved a hug or you know, they people missed funerals and weddings and lots of different sort of events."
"Speaker 5","00;46;21;09","00;46;40;16","Significant events in other people's lives. And old people wanted to do was just, you know, hug the person if they just lost someone. So I think touch has a way of communicating with people on a different level than not just sort of the purely clinical level."
"Speaker 1","00;46;42;00","00;46;47;14","Of them. Ian And then I'll add something thank you."
"Speaker 2","00;46;47;20","00;47;11;05","And yeah, just followed on from what Zoe said, it reminded me, Daniel, of the example you took from the very beginning of the new and active inference manual of, you know, putting your finger on your thigh and saying, is this rough or smooth and you have to kind of you have to move your hand to tell if it's rough or smooth."
"Speaker 2","00;47;11;05","00;47;42;00","And then I'm thinking about, you know, animals preening themselves so preening each other or grooming each other and proposing here from an evolutionary point of view, we've been able we've found this way of distinguishing between, you know, a nice, smooth, something smooth and soft that's supportive and bonding and pop like animals building a park together versus something that's more like a fight or a clash or conflict."
"Speaker 2","00;47;42;29","00;48;15;12","And, you know, in the paper you talked about, we're coming arriving at this sort of insight that we're all identical. I think it was all very similar. So that brings me back to something like safety and a likeness and not reject the role of touch in feeling part of a pack or a tribe versus being rejected or outcast or forked away."
"Speaker 2","00;48;15;26","00;48;53;29","So, yeah, you know, that role of touch in reassuring that everything's OK. We are similar. I the other thing what Francesco's left, but he talks about understanding the generative model. And as he was talking about that, I was thinking about I don't know if anyone's come across something called Hecame. It's a form of group A can be done group or individual work where bit like somatic experiencing where the participants try and understand in a sort of reflective listening each what's going on inside each other."
"Speaker 2","00;48;54;02","00;49;20;13","So try and explore each other's into receptive world plus also what might be going on in their outside life. And I remember hearing about performing a little experiment. So the person who takes on the role of the expert kind of says, OK, let's do a little experiment here. What happens if you know what happens if you say this or do this or take this action what does that do to your your experience?"
"Speaker 2","00;49;20;25","00;50;05;04","And, you know, I think that's kind of what happens anyway in therapy. You know, physiotherapist will give people a list of exercises and say, you know, do this experiment and hope. I hope that you will get better. But I'm just wondering with this sort of paradigm shift of the physiotherapist just being the expert and prescribing something that's definitely going to work, it's more framed as OK, you know, I'd like to encourage the patient to be more experimental rather than just be prescribed something whilst appreciating what you said you'll get George about, you know, they, they actually come wanting their hope to be guided in a certain way."
"Speaker 2","00;50;05;04","00;50;11;26","So, you know, we we need to have a certain level of confidence in guiding but not necessarily being too prescriptive."
"Speaker 3","00;50;15;20","00;50;42;04","The thing about, you know, the generative model and how we can change things so for example, this is to with two sides of the same equation, I would say. One is when you for example, in a patients with your phobia, a fear of movement, when you ask them, you know, for example, you know, can you perform this kind of action typically for low back pain?"
"Speaker 3","00;50;42;04","00;51;06;27","Most people are scared of bending forward, going to flexion because typically associate that's how my desk is going to fall and that's how I ended up in this situation and so on. So, you know, putting in, you know, perceiving a little bit of that of that generative model which could be one of, you know, moving forward, going into flexion equals pain."
"Speaker 3","00;51;08;02","00;51;41;13","You sometimes just by telling, OK, let's try to do this movement. And before the patient actually starts doing the movement, you find straight away an immediate muscle gardening, you know, is a sort of oh yeah, you know, I can't do that. That's, that's hurting straight away. And and in fact, you find sometimes that muscle gardening. So, you know, with a small patient actually coming to the equation at all rather than being diagnostic you can actually also look at what's going on, you know, sort of try to align our mental states with them and predict what's probably going on going on now from a not doing friends perspective."
"Speaker 3","00;51;41;13","00;52;21;14","You could argue that if they believe the state of the brain is very strong, that flexion equals spine. It's likely that kind of a minimal and minimal sensory input is likely to create that muscle spasm. And therefore, yes, I knew I would do this and I would be in pain. OK, so that's what sometimes we we observe. And actually if you start thinking about some of the some of the clinical signs and symptoms you find with patients with persistent pain, for example, and people, you know, I think investor fixation or, you know, a phobia and actually putting through this perspective, you can argue that, you know, what's probably likely to be very strong is a"
"Speaker 3","00;52;21;14","00;52;51;22","generative model sometimes of movement toward this type of action equals damage. Therefore, I have no pain. How can we short circuit the whole thing? How can we start changing a little bit of that generative model, sort of in a sense creating a prediction area that is so great and actually surprises the system. So, for example, you know, one could use, for example, breathing or focusing on so many receptive sensations and that's that's been used by other practitioners."
"Speaker 3","00;52;51;22","00;53;15;07","For example, in musculoskeletal care, the concept of cognitive functional therapy is based a little bit on that. For example, using breathing, asking the patient a symptom of a little bit of breathing, take a deep breath and relax and they'll try to move the movement again. And you find that sometimes that is an improvement on a few ranges, you know, degrees of range of motion."
"Speaker 3","00;53;15;28","00;53;37;28","But arguably, if you think from this perspective, actually you started changing the model, say, oh, a patient sometimes looks at you. So all that actually feels a little bit easier. How come? What have you done? It didn't do anything. You started sort of you created the surprise the system, OK, and you surprise the system in a very positive way, which is a yeah, you know that that's great."
"Speaker 3","00;53;37;28","00;54;02;05","You know, we explore this on the paper that this should be out very, very soon, which is try to understand actually how can we generate a change generative model with guided touch, for example, creating conditions where one could say, OK, let's focus on you know, let's focus on the sensations let's focus. OK, you know, this feels quite tight that actually what I'm doing here, I'm releasing the fashion."
"Speaker 3","00;54;02;05","00;54;35;20","So OK, so you can use that if you think the patient is actually is a suitable candidate for that, you know, you're not actually implanting another generative model. There's something wrong with the structure, OK, that could help. But for example, if the patient gives too much attention to to that, to those sort of sensations, then, you know, it's probably wrong to get them to focus on those sensations so because actually you just perpetuating a little bit of that, you know, belief that prior that actually OK state yeah I'm worried about this and so on."
"Speaker 3","00;54;35;28","00;55;04;24","So for example, we propose these things coming from kind of a traditional sort of meditation Buddhist practices in in you know, that's for example, you can short circuit the whole thing by for example, start talking about something else which we talked about flattening the sensory states. OK, so imagine that, you know, you palpating, you're doing a technique and so on and suddenly, you know, you feel like the patient is giving too much attention to that."
"Speaker 3","00;55;04;24","00;55;25;14","Actually there's a sort of failure of sensory information if you want to using all the jargon here. But if you if you then standardly talk about, oh yeah, you know what, I've got a new dog I was like, Where does the new dog come from? OK? Or, you know, if you think that, you know, they love football, for example, and their team won last night, and so."
"Speaker 3","00;55;25;23","00;55;50;13","Oh, I watched the match last night. It was great, wasn't it? So that takes the attention away from that and actually kind of, you know, maybe enables you to start changing something that so it's a combination of clearly hands on stuff where you cleverly can introduce the language to start, start surprising the system, start changing a little bit of that generative model."
"Speaker 3","00;55;50;13","00;56;15;29","So I think that's OK. It's, you know, colleagues in the UK have developed this Posture Map approach to osteopathy, mindfulness and based approach. Also based on third wave cognitive behavioral therapy and actually uses the similar thing, which is, you know, you're treating it's sort of talking, you're trying to guide sometimes guide the patient say how does this feel?"
"Speaker 3","00;56;15;29","00;56;40;01","What's, what's going on here? Why are you protecting and so on. So you start exploring this. So that could work really well. Arguably, in a person that introspectively able to explore that if they're not intercepted prepared. So for example, switching you know, giving too much attention to what's going on inside for some people makes them even more anxious."
"Speaker 3","00;56;40;18","00;56;56;03","So there's no point in say yeah let's mental interception because you know that's going to be great for everything. No it's not actually you know I feel like a rumble in my tummy. It could be something going on really isn't it. Oh you know what what about if there's a pathology? I just consulted with Doctor Google. He told me about this stuff."
"Speaker 3","00;56;56;14","00;57;18;28","So for some people, that's clearly a no go zone for other people. Yes. You know, we can explore that again if you think through this lens I think that there's a lot of you know, I think one can argue you can have a lot of fun in clinical practice by exploring things rather than limiting yourself to very rigid sort of box approach."
"Speaker 3","00;57;19;09","00;57;43;05","And sometimes you'll get a patient who's, you know, they get up from bed from from the, you know, from the plane and say, well, actually kills a little bit better, you know, actually. And it's painful, but it's not as painful. So arguably you started changing something already and that's where sometimes. OK, is it is it the sorts of expectations is that a placebo phenomena?"
"Speaker 3","00;57;43;16","00;58;09;22","It is what it is. You know, you created all the conditions, you put everything together. They actually created a package of care that arguably can start changing things. And for me and when a patient says he likes you, feels feels a bit easier, it's kind of OK, that's good stuff. You know, it's not the result of my technique is sort to whatever happened in this setting here, there is this you know, they started the road, you know, their journey, the road to recovery and that's pretty good."
"Speaker 3","00;58;10;10","00;58;33;23","And then you you got you know, if you ask the patient sometimes after a few sessions, how do you feel today? You know, I feel better. I feel much better. How's your pain now on the visual analog scale? To be not different from last time or even this, the first session? They may have started with a six or seven or eight or eight out of ten and at this stage are on a six out of ten, for example."
"Speaker 3","00;58;34;04","00;59;05;29","So clinically, there's not a meaningful change anyway, but they may actually say, I feel much better. What does that mean? You know, feeling much better? These the receptive stuff is about, you know, I, I started kind of taking, you know, I started changing something. So there is, I think, stuff to play with that combined clearly not just hands on, but the whole kind of, you know, creating a a package, a multi-sensory let's say experience as well."
"Speaker 1","00;59;08;01","00;59;09;15","Awesome. I'd love to."
"Speaker 5","00;59;09;15","00;59;09;27","Hear."
"Speaker 1","00;59;10;10","00;59;11;10","So so please."
"Speaker 5","00;59;14;16","01;00;01;13","Just to follow up on what George said just from the the last bit and then I'll track back to another point. But I think it does really matter sort of how you do it, whether you try and shift their attention away from it. By talking about something else, whether you shift away from using breathing or trying to approach the the way in a different way, you're basically trying to shift the attention away from what if they especially if they have chronic pain, is an overly sort of precise maladaptive belief I mean, it's just trying to get them to kind of step back a little bit from the prior that maybe or the feeling that they"
"Speaker 5","01;00;01;16","01;00;11;01","have predicted that they're going to feel. So if they like George said Ben Folds as painful if you get them to step back a little bit from that, whether you do that."
"Speaker 3","01;00;13;05","01;00;14;10","Through."
"Speaker 5","01;00;15;04","01;01;04;07","Talking or sort of focusing on your breath through mindfulness, you want to shift it back to the the current what they're feeling rather than what they think that they're about to feel. So you can do that in many different ways. But yeah, definitely to try and focus away from it, I think it's you either kind of go down that path and shift the attention away to kind of then try to refocus or you kind of use touch as what we've done in the paper to try and develop new associations or to reframe or to overwrite the the prior beliefs that maybe aren't quite working for that situation, to try and hope that by reducing and"
"Speaker 5","01;01;04;07","01;01;33;29","rewriting it, by doing those exercises, maybe to try and get them to do something that they, they said they think if they bend forwards because when they hurt their back that they were bending forwards to pick something up from the floor and that was painful. So now they're absolutely terrified. They say bend forwards, that's going to happen. All that dad sort of blew that disk if they when they were bending forwards to lift something, that sort of prior belief."
"Speaker 5","01;01;34;25","01;01;57;17","We just want to try to make the opportunity often through touch or by doing an exercise and giving that sort of feedback that actually, yeah, you're you're bending forwards, but actually it's not that tight. And to try to inhibit that prior belief that they've they've got about expecting the pain and try to reduce the weighting that they've put on it."
"Speaker 5","01;01;57;17","01;02;36;12","So maybe saying, oh, well and even if you can't change it so that they stop believing that every time they bend forward, it's going to be painful even if you can try and reframe it to context specific points to say like, well, if you bend forwards in this way, then it's OK. You might not change the fact that they still think that bending forwards is risky, that they might not be they might be cognitively immune to to changing that completely but you might be able to through touch and through sort of encouraging them to develop the prior for that context."
"Speaker 5","01;02;36;12","01;03;04;10","So if you bend forwards with this posture or this way or that that you can you can update it and change it. So they think OK, well, maybe actually in that situation, it's OK. This brings us back to they did a study with little kids about with one that was slightly younger, one that was about that was slightly older on balance."
"Speaker 5","01;03;04;20","01;03;36;05","And they gave the younger kids thought that balance was just a sort of gravity. So things balanced because they had gravity walking opponent, whereas the older kids thought that it wasn't that simple and that if the object was weighted more on one side, then obviously even if it was gravity pulling it down the tilt. And so there was two different theories of how balance works and they kind of the the investigators gave the kids the other one."
"Speaker 5","01;03;36;05","01;03;59;25","So all the ones that thought it was just plain gravity were introduced to the concept from the other ones and vice versa. And they explain these concepts and then they showed them the block, which they'd kind of use to say like, look, this is the block, this is how it balances, this is your theory. And then they said, Would you want to play an almost an every single one took the block, try it out."
"Speaker 5","01;03;59;25","01;04;24;10","The other theory of how it balance. And then after sort of 10 minutes of play, they asked them what they thought again. And some of them changed their minds and they used that sort of tactile sort of learning and touch to, to update what they thought about that theory of balance and then to change and adapt slightly of what they saw."
"Speaker 5","01;04;24;18","01;04;43;11","Some didn't change it completely, some did. But they all wanted to touch and explore to give them the opportunity to sort of understand that prior and to build up a new belief of what maybe they thought was going on. So I think we do that a lot in clinic."
"Speaker 1","01;04;44;18","01;04;53;07","It's just lost."
"Speaker 5","01;04;53;07","01;05;19;19","So look, you can move further now or it doesn't feel so Thai or that not that you said you had, doesn't feel as heart, things like that. And back to the comment about how we relied on others, I think it was yes, I'm working together, the hunter gatherer thing, they I think it's important to note that with it we've built to work together."
"Speaker 5","01;05;19;22","01;05;44;23","I mean, we haven't got a choice. We might when we're sort of old enough to go hunting deer and boar and things like that. But when we're first born, we need the touch of our mother or a caregiver of some sort to get to get all ascetic needs. We cannot survive without them. If you leave a baby on its own, then they probably won't survive on their own."
"Speaker 5","01;05;44;23","01;06;26;25","They need the mum or the person to to pick them up, to feed them, to regulate their body temperature to, to do everything. They, they don't have a choice. And even before that neonatal you're constantly as a fetus being bombarded with different information from your mum. And we took a step on this in the the paper you need that they, they constantly know what their mom is feeling and so of course once they're born they still want to coordinate with them because that's what they've been used to for nine months of as they start to develop and start to feel touch in different areas and they start to get nerves, they want to explore and"
"Speaker 5","01;06;26;25","01;06;49;14","see what happens. So yeah, we're inherently need to rely on others at some point and while we get older it's not as continuous and we only rely on others. Maybe when we don't know what to do then, then we will. It's not so like I'm not going to relate to my caregiver now. I know what my heart rate should be."
"Speaker 5","01;06;49;14","01;07;04;01","I know what's normal for me and that's different. But when you're younger, you don't have a choice. So and as you can't speak, touches is the first point of communication. So yeah, I think I touch on most of the points that were mentioned earlier."
"Speaker 1","01;07;05;25","01;07;36;07","Awesome. I wanted to bring a few active inference points in and loop it in and then ask a great question in the chat. So we've been talking a lot about the generative model, and so the generative model is a statistical model that includes all these features we've been describing like perception, cognitive variables and action selection. And also it integrates this Bayesian idea of the prior and the updates and the posterior."
"Speaker 1","01;07;36;23","01;08;03;23","So we talked earlier about how the practitioner is engaging in these informative perturbations and experiments of the patient's generative model. And those perturbations can be seen as actions selection that are informative by the generative model of the practitioner. So in the therapeutic alliance, in the niche of that clinic, there's like multiple generative models that are engaging with each other."
"Speaker 1","01;08;03;29","01;08;30;11","And so that's a setting that active inference has been used to study and to connect that back to the birdsong this is just it's such a fascinating avenue of research that I think it's worth going one level into how the birdsong plays out so we're we talked about the conversation and about how the patient has one type of experience and expertize in their own embodiments."
"Speaker 1","01;08;30;21","01;08;55;17","And then the clinician has another type of expertize in their education and also in their embodiment. And where that comes together is through touch. So in the birdsong example, there's this expected birdsong, we can think of it as like the stereotypical or the archetypal birdsong that the birds are expecting to hear. Like if you're listening to a song that you know, you're expecting it to be playing out a certain way."
"Speaker 1","01;08;56;07","01;09;19;10","Now why doesn't one bird just sing? And then the other one is hearing what it expects to hear. So it never takes a turn. And so in other words, like why the equivalent in the, in the clinical setting would be like the expert clinician could just be speaking from their expertize and just giving a one hour lecture on a condition."
"Speaker 1","01;09;19;25","01;09;43;14","Or you could have a situation with a one hour lecture the other direction with just the person sharing for one hour. So how do we move from that like one directional non turn taking, which still could be absolutely expertize on either side, but there's this like emergent joint expertize when there's a conversation. So how does active inference model that turn taking?"
"Speaker 1","01;09;44;03","01;10;11;24","And perhaps not the only way that this could be models, but how it is modeled in the birdsong papers of Forest and Frith is that action selection requires a transient suppression of precision on action selection so in other words, if I'm seated right now and I want to engage in standing up, there has to be a transient suppression of precision, like an openness around What am I doing?"
"Speaker 1","01;10;12;05","01;10;37;05","Because if my confident belief is I am sitting down, then engaging the counterfactual, I could stand up. We'll never be enacted because I have a high precision belief that it's simply not the case. And in fact they've connected that to various movement disorders where there's challenges in initiating or challenges in terminating behavior. And so what's happening with the turn taking birds is that one bird is singing."
"Speaker 1","01;10;37;15","01;11;03;19","And so it's singing from the songbook, so to speak, the expected song. But it's continued engagement in singing is accompanied by this increasing reduction in precision around what it is doing. It's kind of like someone going on a rant and there's like they're actually losing precision. They're losing the thread. As the rant continues as a function of them suppressing accuracy because they have to engage in action."
"Speaker 1","01;11;04;08","01;11;35;27","And then at some point that elicits that acting entity to cease action and to increase its precision through listening, through active listening. And so that is how the birds take turns in this bird song, even though they're singing from the same sheet, they do take turns because they're engaged in like a transient suppression of precision on action that allows them to act then that imprecision around action becomes too much, and then they need to recover that precision through listening again."
"Speaker 1","01;11;36;17","01;11;56;05","So it's quite an interesting thing. And it just reminded me of like, well, there's a dialog. It doesn't have to be equal time doesn't even have to be speaking all the time, but there has to be this emergent dialog otherwise it would just be a one way phone call with the download on the clinical side or the download on the person's experience."
"Speaker 1","01;11;56;16","01;12;23;02","So I hope that that these kinds of formal models like the bird songs, the toy model, but seeing that kind of a generative model play out in the context of the skilled performance and experimentation, this might sound weird, but, you know, why don't you try doing this and then the patient brings up something unconventional or they discover something new about their body, and that is where like healing and openness can occur."
"Speaker 1","01;12;23;02","01;12;47;29","So that was like awesome threads. And then I want to ask the question in the chat for for everybody. It would be great to hear their responses. So Glia Maximalist in the chat has asked, how can patients learn to think about pain in order to update their generative model? Or is this something that is possible to do subconsciously with the assistance of the treatment?"
"Speaker 1","01;12;48;23","01;13;05;06","So what are the explicit cognitive and implicit cognitive aspects of updating generative models around pain yeah. Yeah. George Then and then. Zoe Now."
"Speaker 3","01;13;06;19","01;13;07;22","OK, yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;13;10;03","01;13;44;12","I think it starts with education about pain, what's, what is pain and why people have that experience and clearly having, you know, two sorts of situations where in an acute pain, pain being kind of regarded typically as, as, as a useful protective mechanism if you just hurt yourself, you know, if you twist your ankle and you're in pain and there's a minor tissue problem and that needs time to heal and so on."
"Speaker 3","01;13;44;12","01;14;08;11","So clearly there is pain that people need to understand that, you know, you're in pain because this happened in protection and should go away and so on. The challenge is, is much more complex when we face chronic pain because, you know, in those cases and a lot of times that protection no longer needs to be there. What it is protecting from from what it is, is not necessarily a need to to protect."
"Speaker 3","01;14;08;11","01;14;37;18","But the system becomes pretty good. That's you know, it's almost like generating that stuff. And people continue having sometimes a presentation that is, you know, limping or or a particular muscle spasms, pain movement and so on. So it's about sort of starting with within, you know, getting the person to understand the nature of what's what pain is about without giving them a lecture on the neuroscience of pain because, you know, that that's clearly does not work as well."
"Speaker 3","01;14;37;18","01;15;14;24","So it needs to be something that is simple, straightforward to starts with that there needs to be a a reasonably well explained kind of framework you know, what are you talking about, the birdsong and so on. It's kind of interesting thing about, you know, sensory attenuation, which in the context of, of chronic pain. And we argue that on the other paper on active most osteopathic areas in active inference that probably in some cases of chronic pain is, is actually a failure of this attention."
"Speaker 3","01;15;14;24","01;15;59;00","So disengaging from that constant attention to to the problem how to achieve that is again communication touching talking or not talking and taking turns. And and the analogy to the birdsong case is clearly it's a fascinating thing is clearly what we try to to reach you know that that synchrony between two or more individuals in that clinical setting when things start kind of working well and so it's leading to somewhere just some thoughts so in thank you."
"Speaker 2","01;15;59;14","01;16;40;29","Yes I agree with agree with that that certain needs to be kind of simple and understandable explanation but challenging that the perhaps previous views I'm just sort of reminded of it's specifically for the person to ask this question the work of Yoni Asher and to Wagner's pain me processing therapy study is a bold study, but it's been converted into a book called The Way Out on Chronic Pain and an app called Curable."
"Speaker 2","01;16;40;29","01;17;11;18","So for people who are watching this live stream, there are some simple things to check out and the way out is published by Penguin and that the elements of how they suggest to self, you know, self care for chronic pain are two things. So one is they call it somatic tracking, which is basically an intercept of exercise where you with curiosity and lightness and openness sort of explore the pain."
"Speaker 2","01;17;12;13","01;17;41;26","And secondly is to build evidence of safety. So to actually literally write lists of, you know, right now I'm experiencing evidence that my body, I'm safe in my body for whatever reason it might be because, you know, just I'm here sitting and breathing. That means I'm relatively safe so those two things exploring the the pain in a different way and building evidence of safety."
"Speaker 2","01;17;42;18","01;17;48;23","So that's, you know, I think that's a quite nice starting point thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;17;48;24","01;17;56;07","So anything you would add there yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;17;56;14","01;18;32;11","Sorry. It's not day. Yeah. I think definitely, as George said, trying to keep it simple is essential. If I start talking to my patient about like the ICC and how it changes this part of the brain and it works on this that I think I'd lose them within 5 seconds. They're not most patients. While they're not so interested in all the neuroscience behind it, if you tried to to speak to them, I think it depends on the patient how best to sort of make their pain kind of realized."
"Speaker 5","01;18;32;11","01;18;53;20","I think most patients find it difficult to say what their pain is. Sometimes they can't describe what they're feeling. They they they don't know the words to kind of say, which is why sort of I think touch is also useful in this aspect because you might be able to try and show someone something without actually having to to say it."
"Speaker 5","01;18;55;13","01;19;27;00","And definitely, as George said, in chronic pain, it's again not so simple. People can be cognitively immune no matter how much you tried to explain it. They might just not want to sort of update or to to hear it. So yeah, I think it depends on their price, their situation and how best you think that you can kind of get that across whatever way you think might be more amenable to them or possible to you."
"Speaker 1","01;19;27;13","01;19;28;12","They say, Yeah, yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;19;30;14","01;20;06;23","Thanks. Just picking up on what George and Zoe have said about, you know, different sub subcategories of patients who might be more or less open to different tools that can be offered to them. So as you said, you know, someone who's suffering from a certain type of anxiety might be immune to bringing more attention to their intercepted sensorium, whereas, you know, that might be accessible to someone who's cognitively immune to that, you know, the conceptual idea, they might actually enjoy that."
"Speaker 2","01;20;07;11","01;20;29;16","So I'm thinking for future research, how can we find markers or indicators for these different subcategories of people that could be picked up really early? So, you know, a therapist can say work their way through a flow diagram when I'm doing my taking my history case history for this patient, they you know, as I'm talking to them, they seem you know, they're open."
"Speaker 2","01;20;29;17","01;20;53;12","They're showing signs of being open to this thing, but not that thing. And then you can work your way through and end up with, OK, I'm going to use this, I'm going to try this tool first as the first test. And then if that doesn't work, then I try try that. So, you know, getting some big studies with big end numbers that that try to identify these steps, different subcategories of clinical indicators."
"Speaker 1","01;20;54;20","01;20;56;02","That's awesome. Thanks, Zoe."
"Speaker 5","01;20;57;08","01;21;27;26","I'm yeah, so I haven't read massively big studies. But one thing to consider that you can get from the case history is the family, especially if you're treating kids, the research that's come out more recently on the parents trials, they took a study looking at kids in a tangible clinic. 93% of their parents had pain head had had some sort of pain."
"Speaker 5","01;21;28;28","01;21;55;19","They showed that if the parents reported pain when they were doing exercise, the kids were more likely to have higher pain. Levels to report more problems, not just in general health issues, not just with that, but also things like they didn't want to do the homework. So even more general things were affected by sort of the way that their parents thought they were more likely to catastrophize."
"Speaker 5","01;21;55;28","01;22;22;20","That was one massive thing that if their parents had to experience more pain, then the kid's risk of catastrophizing was significantly more. And almost that you could predict the amount that they would from that. Same with studies with oxytocin, the parents oxytocin from 10 minutes play with their kid then meant that you could empirically predict how much oxytocin the kid would increase."
"Speaker 5","01;22;23;14","01;22;47;00","So I think some things like that, you can pick up from the case history if you know people or they're willing to let you know about what might be going on previously. Some patients won't want to talk about it, but some you might be able to get from if there's more than one of them in it or something like that."
"Speaker 5","01;22;47;01","01;23;22;04","That's one indicator now of what, you know, if you they come in and someone else or they've said something about a belief that someone else had, it might be harder to kind of change it. Like, why are you more of an expert than the parent or whoever had said it? So I think that's there's one way that they're starting to kind of pick up that you could easily implement into your case cases you might already be asking about that you just didn't realize the significance of it."
"Speaker 5","01;23;22;04","01;23;26;06","You knew it was significant, but not to the extent that we're now sort of starting to realize."
"Speaker 1","01;23;27;10","01;24;02;12","Hmm, yes. Very interesting. Of course, we're just exploring different avenues, but in and it's not my area as only an aunt's doctor, but whether somebody uses thinking or feeling type words or refers to their own direct experience versus the experience of somebody who they trust versus information they received from a search engine, those are all cues. Maybe that is what then the clinical decision making pivots towards."
"Speaker 1","01;24;02;25","01;24;25;28","Or maybe it's acute that other areas in that cognitive space would be informative to explore. Like if somebody spends ten sentences talking about what they received from their body, you could ask if you've asked anyone else or what did you look at when you researched it. If somebody says ten things about just what they researched, maybe, how does that reflect with your own experience?"
"Speaker 1","01;24;25;28","01;24;46;25","Like just to kind of even the score and sample across different regions of this space, then that could potentially help give give a coherent and holistic perspective, which is kind of implicit in a lot of the discussions that all of you are bringing here."
"Speaker 2","01;24;46;29","01;25;19;27","So in already, good suggestions there. And Zoe, as you were talking, I was thinking about now I've heard sort of similar studies with parents with digestive problems and, you know, children with potentially problems. But then it got me thinking about intergenerational trauma and DNA methylation and, you know, epigenetics and whether that, you know, is not necessarily within our scope immediately."
"Speaker 2","01;25;19;27","01;25;34;29","But longer term, are there any DNA screen methylation screen patterns that can be used to see if someone might be more or less open to different interventions."
"Speaker 1","01;25;37;19","01;26;15;05","Interesting note there like and these these cognitive approaches, it's a it's a compliment to understanding the correlation between the room and logical outcomes of the parents and the children. Like one possible aspect is there's a predisposition carried through the DNA sequence carried through and epi genomic modification carried through a shared and cultured niche, a shared way of expecting things like those may come differently into play in the end equals one that is the therapeutic alliance that's assembling around this person."
"Speaker 1","01;26;15;14","01;26;45;21","Who is having this experience. And so that is kind of like what breaks through the the large end and just presents us very plainly and starkly with this one person's experience. And there isn't going to be a large study with that person because nobody will ever replicate one or two or five of those aspects. So that's like where the, the, the large and the small end and sort of a top down and a bottom up approach to these topics."
"Speaker 1","01;26;46;08","01;26;48;07","It's it's the compromise."
"Speaker 3","01;26;49;00","01;27;16;07","Josh Yeah. That would be fascinating to try to see if people are more predisposed to respond to some forms of therapy or not. Interesting thing. You know, we we've done several studies in, you know, in a theology and with preterm babies, and we found that osteopathic care seemed to produce well was effective in reducing the length of stay in hospital."
"Speaker 3","01;27;16;07","01;27;48;22","We tested also the hypothesis comparing in a static touch with a far more dynamic, effective touch. We saw that, you know, there is there is a role in modulating the reducing arousal from from an autonomic perspective. It seems to, you know, babies respond to that. And one could argue that actually they are you know, the problem is there aren't right yet because, you know, they're responding to to that to that contact."
"Speaker 3","01;27;49;02","01;28;35;01","We also know that kangaroo care is an effective evidence based approach in preterm for preterm so scheme to sing in contact with with with parents. So this stuff seems you know again place you know suggests that thought seems to play an important role it would be good and we try to do that to look at for example the babies that received deaths hands on intervention to follow them for a number of years into perspective study and actually see what happened you know in terms of cognitive events you know and general for the development of this but then you know if we if we start thinking about OK yes OK the babies are sort of not"
"Speaker 3","01;28;35;17","01;28;59;14","don't know really how to respond then there are some some interesting ideas being developed in particular with people like and channel looking at in utero being the first prior. In fact OK so so and if you look at in some cultures mothers touch their belly and and sort of interact start interacting with with the baby very early on."
"Speaker 3","01;29;00;15","01;29;40;07","So actually arguably those babies already started being touched in this sort of primed to probably respond in a better in a more positive way to tactile kind of stimulation. This is also research start talking about for example in the case of of twins they start touching each other around so at week 1220 or so. So again there's a form of you know tactile contact stimulation on the other authors for example Catarina for diplo talks about that actually the first prior is actually the mother for example."
"Speaker 3","01;29;40;07","01;30;16;29","So again goes to the idea that actually either through you know prior to one being born the sort of that the interaction with the mother creates that prior. So likely you know creates a predisposition perhaps to to to the sort of good response to a more manual type of intervention. So you know the fascinating things can be explored of course you know always have, you know, from an agnostic perspective, sometimes in randomized controlled trials people say, yeah, but you know, those guys kind of, you know, it was good outcome because those were good responders to treatment anyway."
"Speaker 3","01;30;17;14","01;30;37;09","But again, what does being a good responded to a manual type of intervention actually means? You know, the variables are such you know, so many that do actually you know, kind of the scope is huge. So one could explore. But actually there are some serious questions in, you know, in the whole thing for sure."
"Speaker 1","01;30;38;24","01;30;43;17","Thank you, Zoe. And then we'll have kind of a closing thoughts as we finish that up. One."
"Speaker 5","01;30;45;05","01;31;11;09","Yeah, I think just to go off what George said, they've shown in your notes as well that as basically as soon as an area of the body starts to get any sort of naave innovation at all, the fetus will start to touch that area. So when they start to get the face, which is often one of the first, that's why you see a lot on ultrasounds."
"Speaker 5","01;31;11;09","01;31;50;29","They'd be touching their faces or their hands or things as soon as they get innervation to that area, that touching it to explore, to see what that what is this that they can now feel. So I think definitely touch is one of the first things that people will use to develop a prior or to just understand what is going on in sort of the world is is around them to expand upon what George said the long term they did do one study about the long term effects of a kangaroo care incubator and full term babies."
"Speaker 5","01;31;51;07","01;32;24;18","And they found that while this was more towards the synchrony with the parrot. But when they were initially it was the the full term ones that didn't need any help, had the sort of strongest synchrony, the strongest sort of physiologic build to the illustrate, sorry, my arm and then the skin skin contact was sort of next and then the incubator was after."
"Speaker 5","01;32;25;01","01;32;48;24","This was initially one, they were the doing it. But when they followed up on these same kids when they were adults, they found that actually the the synchrony between them when they were adults to their parents was the same. So the ones that got the skin to skin contact had the same as the full term ones. So it had developed over that whole life."
"Speaker 5","01;32;48;24","01;33;17;15","That continuous effect of touch builds up so that they were on par, whereas before they were lower down. So it's not something that's just developed in those sort of critical period where things are developing more is something that the effects that had happened when you were one, two, three to building up when you were 12 to 18 still have an effect when you're not."
"Speaker 5","01;33;17;15","01;33;42;01","I mean, there's areas of the brain that don't start developing fully into your 26. So that's a lot of experiences that you're going to have from different parts until that age. They're all going to contribute to it. So it's not sort of just the first prize. Then they've shown that those prior, especially with touch, are still evident in adults just because they had as they."
"Speaker 1","01;33;43;19","01;34;30;27","It's another value for integrative models. We can have continuity between the nutrients delivery in utero and then the neonatal with the spoon coming in, airplane making the landing and then adults who have a little bit more agency maybe in their Perry personal space with the spoon and landing the airplane. But there's the supply chain. So it's just another part of an extended nutrient cycling system and are we going to have custom narrow theories for each one of these settings and or will we have some layers and interoperability between these different settings that help us like transpose useful models and find areas of contact?"
"Speaker 1","01;34;31;04","01;34;59;25","Those are all really important areas for lifelong learning like you brought up. And there's areas of the brain that continue after year. 26 people still learn things. And so that's brain development too. I just wanted to look at figure one and or figure two. And just in kind of our closing thoughts, what is one of figure one and figure to both have like a really creative and delightful style."
"Speaker 1","01;35;00;13","01;35;40;13","So figure one is focusing on different functions that are discussed in the paper and in relationship to empirical evidence around different brain regions. And Figure two is kind of pulling out one level, looking at different functions that are rising in here, the diet. So maybe if each person, whether figure one or figure two, what's like one area that you're excited to talk about in two or one thing that you think like really stood out to you as something that was a contribution that you weren't seeing in other work or in other ways of representing these topics."
"Speaker 1","01;35;41;24","01;35;49;27","So maybe Ian first and then we'll hear from the authors, but anything from figure one or figure two that would be exciting to explore more."
"Speaker 2","01;35;51;19","01;36;17;03","Thanks, Daniel. What stands out for me today is the two monkeys doing a one handed handstand with a joyful look on their face. So this idea of cooperative communication and that to me today that speaks to this idea of, you know, that neither of them look like they're an expert. They look like they're playing together, which is a nice approach to to think of in the Therapeutic Alliance."
"Speaker 2","01;36;17;18","01;36;51;00","Not always possible to be playful, but you know, when possible. Can we be like the monkeys? Then, moving on to what I'd like to explore, maybe this idea of arriving at the realization that we're similar or identical. So again, those monkeys look pretty identical, but what does that mean? I'd like to hear from the authors about about that and then maybe next time or exploring this idea of when the generative models or the allostatic regulation, the set points start to drift."
"Speaker 2","01;36;52;06","01;37;25;17","And that, you know, I'm thinking more broadly in our society are health. Global health problems are all that drifting of our allostatic set points or are in food production and what healthy food actually means and how it's how that's airplane coming into the mouth. You know, the some expert model has told us that certain foods should be what we eat but that the health indicators suggest that it's not not model may not be the best model."
"Speaker 2","01;37;25;27","01;37;40;01","And how do we as therapists are open to this active inference model kind of keep that possibility of drifting, this model drifting? And how do we how do we decide what the set point should be yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;37;40;01","01;37;48;09","From the airplane landing the spoon to literally the airplane landing with the food. We never go."
"Speaker 3","01;37;50;29","01;37;51;09","Hmm."
"Speaker 1","01;37;52;00","01;37;53;17","OK, figure one or figure two."
"Speaker 3","01;37;53;19","01;38;49;21","George I have no I don't think I have much more to add. You know, the figure figure one, of course. You know, it's a sort of an overview really where potentially so these are sort of detective effects of starts at all different levels. Yes. Yeah. You know, one thing I'm quite keen actually that think about the two monkeys playing and kind of communicating and so on is that although we we, you know, we have a strong bias in the paper towards the sort of more neuroscience kind of based model, that it is critical that we don't turn the whole thing into an Eurocentric model because ultimately if we complain too much about biomedical model and"
"Speaker 3","01;38;49;21","01;39;28;06","then kind of pain management became brain centric, neuro centric model, kind of, you know, nothing really changes, does it? You know, it just sort of still, you know, depending on an expert that tells tells you exactly what to do. So, yeah, that's I like, you know, the figure to kind of gives us more a little bit of a an ability to look at that the whole kind of process where within that process and again, I'm quite aware of, you know, criticisms that, you know, this paper may also attract from."
"Speaker 3","01;39;28;06","01;39;53;06","Yeah, you know, these guys just basically pontificating around touch is the most important thing and so on. And I clearly I'm not on that that that level I'm I'm clearly arguing for. No, no it's not that is is it is an important tool it's an important vehicle. But ultimately it's about communication in my opinion. It's about the me you know what's what I what I'm trying to kind of getting to that niche that birdsong and yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;39;54;08","01;40;23;03","Getting that biobehavioral synchrony going. And I think you know when you getting there then thinks you know can some very interesting things can happen and and you know we can explore this that 2.0 and excitement even some ideas about some of the techniques that potentially people kind of make big arguments and people are super critical about you know for example more cranial sacral cranial bicep stuff that doesn't work that way."
"Speaker 3","01;40;23;03","01;40;54;17","But you know one could argue that maybe the phenomena that we observe is actually a phenomenal synchrony sees that in the birdsong and that enables us to get some very interesting things going. So I just I'm thinking aloud to allow them kind of exploring through, but I think for me that's so figured too. Clearly, the other one is something, you know, that we don't treat the brain and treat the person as a person lives in that in that body rather than treating bodies."
"Speaker 3","01;40;54;17","01;41;20;05","You know, we're not, you know, don't think we should be at that level and as body work, you know, it's not body work is you know, it's it's a different story and it's really it's about the person more than the body. The body tells the story, but it can be a marker of blanket. Body can be many things, but body provides a landscape, sensory landscape, an opportunity to get in, to kind of influence and so on."
"Speaker 3","01;41;20;05","01;41;42;01","But that's it, you know, what about the person is there? And I would say that's that's for me the fascinating bit, you know, and sometimes the thing you change minus things in their generative model and the whole thing starts getting better. Anything, you know, you surprise yourself. That's placebo, you know, whatever it is. But, you know, that's I think that's that's the beauty of it."
"Speaker 1","01;41;44;25","01;42;08;13","Yes. From kind of body work, the cadaver materialism, physical ism to embodied work with the richness of the situation. That's the map and the territory. And it's very interesting. And the last word for the first author yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;42;08;16","01;42;39;11","So I think the thing figures I think figure one, when I was sort of sketching out what I sort of wanted to do for I did again sort of go with from what George said, it's not yes, it's neuro centric in terms of it's labeled based on the areas of the brain. But if you think more broadly about it, the I mean, it covers a wide range of things."
"Speaker 5","01;42;39;11","01;43;02;27","You have the two monkeys having fun to the mom holding her baby to sort of then, you know, people being really happy that they've won something so then the whole I mean, it just I think what I like about it is while it shows that touch yeah, it's a vehicle for change, but it affects a lot of different things."
"Speaker 5","01;43;03;12","01;43;29;03","And it's things that we might not. Yeah. When we're examining someone in clinic, we're not thinking like, is this rewarding or are we making the bird song with the two birds kind of doing it? It's something that we, we innately do. I don't think we specifically always focus on that, all the different effects. And I think it's nice to see an overview of touches."
"Speaker 5","01;43;29;03","01;43;59;19","Not so simple. I think it shows very clearly that touch is not just touch. You might it's not just you touch someone, you are affecting lots of different things or can affect lots of different things depending on how you use it. So it's just one vehicle for change, but it can affect a lot of different things. I liked doing it to show all just how varied it can be and how it can be manipulated for lots of different things."
"Speaker 5","01;44;00;16","01;44;33;03","The second one, again, like George said, it's not so sort of scientific. It does. I think it it shows very well that touch is used through the sort of holding of hands in the middle, but that's not the main thing. It shows I like how we tried to show the different sort of aspects of each other. So what the sort of practitioner might be thinking towards what the patient could interpret the same thing as very different."
"Speaker 5","01;44;33;15","01;44;55;08","So you see with like be there trying to help and console and see they're trying to move around. But then on the other side you've got like G where maybe they think the, the practitioner might be like yeah. Thinking Oh OK, this injury, you know, in a few weeks time they'll be getting back on the feet, they'll get a strengthening, we can start doing rehab."
"Speaker 5","01;44;55;18","01;45;17;16","But really actually the other one could be thinking, gee, like, oh no, I'm going to be stuck in a wheelchair forever. It's the same thing. I like how it shows. The same thing can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on the priors and everything that we've been talking about. It's not the the communication, the way things are interpreted can be interpreted things very differently with the same stimulus."
"Speaker 5","01;45;18;26","01;45;41;01","And I think that's what we try to show or hopefully we try to show the active difference is a lot more inclusive of lots of different things that might be going on in treatment. Rather than just one thing that just get them better. It's not not not so simple. There's a lot of things going on that we try to include."
"Speaker 1","01;45;43;05","01;46;09;20","Well, on the theme of the same stimuli or observation resulting in different implications for different individuals. When I saw the handshake and the symbol in the middle, I thought of the DNA double helix and of like a sort of feeling touched because it's more like a brainwave synchrony telepathy situation. Otherwise their bodies would have been touching. So I think that's an awesome conversation."
"Speaker 1","01;46;09;20","01;46;23;11","This was a great addition to the work itself, and we're really looking forward to 44.2 next week. At the same time, so we'll look forward to seeing everybody. Then again."
"Speaker 2","01;46;25;18","01;46;26;13","Thank you very much."
"Speaker 1","01;46;26;23","01;46;27;09","See Sia."
"Speaker 3","01;46;27;20","01;46;28;03","Thank you."
"Speaker 4","01;46;28;14","01;46;28;24","Thank."
