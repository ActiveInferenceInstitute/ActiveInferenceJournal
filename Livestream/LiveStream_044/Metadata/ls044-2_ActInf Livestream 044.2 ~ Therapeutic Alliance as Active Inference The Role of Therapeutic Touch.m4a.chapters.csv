28100	68740	00:28	This is ActInf Lab Livestream number 44.2. We're a participatory online lab that is practicing applied active inference. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams. Please provide feedback so we can improve our work.	This is ActInf Lab Livestream number 44.2	Livestream
69800	221170	01:09	Today in 44.2, we are in our third discussion around the paper, therapeutic alliance as Active Inference the Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony from 2022. Feel free to add anything in that area.	This is our third discussion around the paper, therapeutic alliance from 2022	Discussion Around The Paper (Therapeutic Collaboration and Synchron
222100	387100	03:42	George: Where do I see this going forward? I think we can definitely explore those ideas about the synchronization to agents. It would be important to talk about not just diadic, but triadic or otherwise. Anyone that wants to ask questions, feel free to go for it.	George: Where do I see this going forward with synchrony research	The issue of synchrony in osteopath care
387550	763200	06:27	Ian. George. How was synchrony approached in the active inference literature? A lot of aspects of how we achieve therapeutic alliance was through synchrony. Without that connection between the different people, we wouldn't be able to save energy to work together.	How was synchrony approached in this paper? Why was it key	Osteopathic Therapeutic Alliance: Synchrony
765430	1478966	12:45	I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony and the little bits I've read in the literature. What are we synchronizing towards and is it always beneficial? Is it always about minimizing free energy? Arguably the first thing that people need to be in a clinical setting is good communicator.	Daniel: I'm fascinated by the topic of synchrony in therapy	George on Synchrony and its implications
1479068	1586966	24:39	Yeah, just thinking about beliefs in the way that we might talk about them. Not always like a psychological experienced belief but in some statistical way it's like they're held stances that are updated in some way or partially or completely by certain kinds of incoming information. And then also this is going to be I think very interesting to return to the free energy minimization.	Just thinking about beliefs in the way that we might talk about them	Bayesian Intelligence on Beliefs
1587068	1852960	26:27	Are we saying that this synchrony in the therapeutic reliance is a form of co regulation? And then I'm just thinking also other forms of therapeutic synchrony and co regulation. How you achieve that core regulation, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic parasympathetic is primarily through the use of techniques.	Zoe: I'm thinking about synchrony and co regulation in therapy	Self-regulation and co-regulation in therapy
1853650	2048830	30:53	S synchrony is a multipronged approach where touch matters, that communication matters as much as touch. It's not a technique X, Y or NZ, but it's actually the whole package of care that's likely to enable us to get there.

2049170	2078278	34:09	Welcome. Do you want to add anything or ask anything? Not right off the bat, just hi. I'm sorry I missed last week and I've really enjoyed the discussions of the paper so far. So the Dopamine angle and a few other things we'll return to.	Welcome. I'm sorry I missed last week's discussion	Last Week's Discussion of the Dopamine Paper
2078364	2379970	34:38	Free energy is being used like a connective tissue here. It's helping us connect different sensory modalities and therapeutic modalities. What is the real sort of hidden goal? Is this minimization of true surprise. How does that fit into sense making?	We were talking about minimizing free energy and how does that fit into sense making	Minimizing free energy in the active inference textbook
2380870	2461860	39:40	George: It's interesting to think about that in terms of using touch to kind of resolve uncertainty about the hidden states. And it brings back the paper that you guys mentioned in the zero the communication as active inference. It really is like a bi directional, harmonious thing happening.	Touch can resolve uncertainty about hidden states, George says	Exploring the Hidden States of Communication
2463110	2759380	41:03	In chronic conditions, the concept of cognitive immunization is common. Patients observe us for sure, and they know when we kind of are confident and so on. Try to understand someone else's internal state, predicting a little bit of their mental state. That's where synchrony and that's where alignment kind of plays that important role.	Who's observing, who's been observed? I think the free energy model	Cognitive Immunity and the birdsong
2760230	3308594	46:00	Zoe: Sense making is quite an interesting thing too when we look at some clinical conditions. Sometimes with patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems that also have a comorbidity they have depression. By understanding, by interacting can potentially start taking the patient in a particular direction.	Sense making is quite an interesting thing when we look at some clinical conditions	Comorbidity and sense making
3308632	4030396	55:08	Hollywood and filmmakers are masters of inducing synchrony. There's an opportunity there to kind of open up cognitively and explore some other ideas that maybe the person wasn't able to before. Where are the opportunities? How can we start that process of change?	George: Hollywood and filmmakers are masters of inducing synchrony	The complex causal network of depression
4030588	4813550	1:07:10	Osteopaths need to be aware of the power of what's the hidden state and that touch can trigger. Particularly in trauma situations, memories are embodied. And when you touch someone in a particular part of the body, that might again bring that unconscious stuff about. Could use the whole world of healthcare practice to use touch and synchrony.	George: Touch can trigger hidden state responses in trauma situations	The power of touch in healing emotional trauma
4814640	4902760	1:20:14	What variables are latent states or observable in general? And then in the specific case, for example, maybe there's a total, absolutely perfect association between hippocampus volume and some other clinical outcome. variables can be observable in one context and latent in another context.	What variables are latent states or observable in general	Causal causation network 1, Partial observable and latent states
4902830	5415870	1:21:42	George: How can we change the generative model, the cognitive models? Could there be something welcoming on the door of the room that is a modification of the niche or some other design choice that helps scaffold this therapeutic niche? What would anyone like to look at or turn to?	George: I loved your summary of all those active inference questions	Active Inference in the Clinical Process
5419200	5650890	1:30:19	One thought on the free energy minimizing. Different action pathways are evaluated based upon their ability to reduce uncertainty or provide direct value. That thing sort of modifying pain, modifying symptoms. Going a little bit with small things at that level are quite important in the greater scheme of things.	Free energy is calculated for a given policy sequence of actions	The free energy of pain
5652220	5843940	1:34:12	Pain is an interesting one. Not every patient is going to come in and go, yeah, I want to be in less pain. It might be something that a goal to that patient is more important than if their pain is less. What we're measuring will be very individual to the patient.	Zoe: Pain is an interesting question. Not every patient is going to want less pain	How to manage chronic pain with massage?
5845560	6008090	1:37:25	Ian: I'm thinking short term goals and long term goals here. The intention behind it all is to help them. But agreeing on those more broader life goals or referring to someone else if I don't agree with that, that's more of an ethical issue.	Ian says agreeing on goals is so important when helping endurance runners	Ethical issues of goals for runners
6009660	6512090	1:40:09	We have another paper to be submitted very soon, the next week or so, the same topic, but in pediatrics. One of the first lines to start exploring is synchrony between mother, baby and practitioner. It's time now to start testing some of this stuff for sure.	What are some of your next directions for this line of research and application	Osteopathic and Pediatrics: Future directions
6512560	6548288	1:48:32	Very cool. All right, well, thank you for this excellent two. And everyone is welcome back to give us updates on their learning and application on this very important area. See you later.	All right, well, thank you for this excellent two. That concludes 44 and really appreciated the authors joining	Dot Zero
