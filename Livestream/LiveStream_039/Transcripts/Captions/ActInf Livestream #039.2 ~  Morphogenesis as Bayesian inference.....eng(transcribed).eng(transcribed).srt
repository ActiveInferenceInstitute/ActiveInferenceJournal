6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,640
welcome to the actin flap we're a

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,719
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
at the links here on the slide

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
this is recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,280
feedback so we can improve on our work

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,360
welcome and we'll be following video

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
etiquette for live streams

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,000
check out

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,960
anything that the lab is up to

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
today in

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
stream number 39.2 we're in our third

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
discussion around this paper

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,880
morphogenesis as bayesian inference a

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,479
variational approach to pattern

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
formation control in complex biological

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,560
systems

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
by franz kuchling who's here with us as

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
well as fristen gyorgev and levin

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
so

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
we're gonna have a fun discussion in the

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
dot two the dot zero was some background

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
and context hopefully overviewing the

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,240
paper

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,799
the dot one we had a discussion that

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
opened up several threads

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
and today we will in the dot two

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,119
say hello

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
on the introductions and then just jump

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,399
in

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
to a blank slide or to a not blank slide

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
so

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,039
california and i'll pass it to dean

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
good morning i'm dean i'm in calgary and

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,199
i am going to say that i have one thing

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
i want to look at down the road which is

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,959
how long is a person a stem cell

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
which i think this paper might help us

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
parse a little bit and i'll pass it down

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
to blue

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
hi i'm blue i'm a researcher in new

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
mexico and i also

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
similar to dean have questions about um

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
when a cell becomes a cancer cell and

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
like how does it develop its own

56
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,200
generative model and just in general

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
like when you're looking at complex

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
systems how these small perturbations

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
can lead to like a totally different

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
effect downstream which i think is kind

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
of related to the stem cell question

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
that dean has

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
and i'll pass it over to the first

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
author events

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
hi i'm france um

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
i am a phd student in the 11th lab in

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
tufts

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
near boston and yeah i study

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
part of active influence in my

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,239
theoretical work and i do a lot of

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
experimental work as well looking at

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
information processing and organisms and

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
cells

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
oh so where does

75
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,159
stemness

76
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
or how do stem cells play into this

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
paper and this line of research france

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
definitely something we've touched on

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
but just to kind of start generally and

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
then we'll zoom in somewhere so take it

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,959
away

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,319
sure um

83
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
the the idea is that the

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
the cells initially when they're in the

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,200
simulation when they're being

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
initialized they have um the random

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
emulation initialized and they have very

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
low

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
beliefs about what cell type they are

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
they can be one of four different cell

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
types in this particular simulation

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
and they all share

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
a a model a

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
morphology they could achieve that they

95
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
essentially are programmed to achieve at

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
some point

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
but none of the cells are any of the

98
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
given cell types initially at least not

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
with any um significant precision

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,599
um

101
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,720
and as they move along signaling to each

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
other and sensing each other and

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
secreting

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
signal types in response to each other

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
they then slowly by slowly infer a cell

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
type which essentially is

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
differentiation

108
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,680
so

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
cells starting with low precision about

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
what kind of cell they believe

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,520
themselves to be

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
and then there's a process of

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,199
differentiation

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
so dean or blue any

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
thoughts on that sort of stem to

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
differentiated

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
uh continuum and i'll pull up an image

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,120
from a non-active perspective that also

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,160
shows that kind of a continuum

120
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,120
so

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
i

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
have just something to add that's ties

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
into the paper where there's aberrant

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
signaling so

125
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,039
a stem cell differentiates but then

126
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,440
during the process of carcinogenesis

127
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
like retains some kind of or or d

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
differentiates into something that's

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
more similar to

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
a stem cell than it is to a different

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
kind of cell

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
and so this plasticity is important to

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
retain like so that we can repair

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
ourselves but also it can lead to

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
kind of a

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,080
an aberrant signaling pattern

137
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,638
yep like this uh

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
notion of having a terminal cell

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
revert to a state

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
and regain the ability of having

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
stemness is

142
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,240
one of the characteristics of cancer

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
because it can then sometimes

144
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
differentiate into other cell types that

145
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,160
are like normal and downstream of a

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,280
precursor or abnormal in some other way

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
how is also something

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
i was going to say it's not something

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,919
that happens and especially in higher

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
organisms right not not every organisms

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
keeps absolute stem cells in all kinds

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
of populations one example that i used

153
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
to work on is an uh and zebra fish where

154
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
you have

155
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
an always developing eye and there's

156
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,600
certain

157
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
um

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
they're parts of the retina essentially

159
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
that can be differentiate some extents

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
they're not entirely stem cells they

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
have a stem cell niche as well but

162
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
there's also especially they know also

163
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
in higher organisms while they keep

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
those populations of either stem cells

165
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
or of um already partially

166
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,160
differentiated cells that can be

167
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
differentiate so it's an important um

168
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,400
part regeneration um

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,479
and ironically this is something that's

170
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
not been studied for 401 of this there's

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,919
some older research that was done where

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319
a highly highly regenerative organisms

173
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
when they undergo um they did this in

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
salamanders and they injected them with

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
carcinogens and they basically had it

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
um you know saw a tumor progressing and

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
then they cut up a lymph in these

178
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
elements of highly regenerating it would

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
actually renormalize um the the tumors

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
essentially so initiation of

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
regeneration and those organisms seems

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,400
to actually counteract

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,199
um

184
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,880
cancer progression and even kind of

185
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
remove the tumors

186
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
which is very interesting and it kind of

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
this feeds a little bit into the idea in

188
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
this paper as well that

189
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
regeneration right what what happens is

190
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
you suddenly now have a much higher flow

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
of information on things to rearrange to

192
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
to redifferentiate

193
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
and

194
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
and that is kind of like what i was

195
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
thinking as well with the simulation

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
here of the the the cancer rescue

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
phenomena where you

198
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
you get you rescue this um this

199
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,560
formation of aberrancy abram cells and

200
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
iron signaling by having a strong

201
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
contact um between cells

202
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,639
as well nothing i'm modeling generation

203
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
here although you can i think in the

204
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,120
original paper carl has done some way to

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,879
cut i think part off and let it let it

206
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,240
grow again i think that has been done in

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
the original paper and knowing one's

208
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,039
place

209
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,919
um

210
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,280
but that's something to kind of keep in

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,599
mind this is something that that

212
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,840
is experimentally highly studied

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
um to an extent

214
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,720
so one general note and then a question

215
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
this question this idea that the

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
organisms that have the highly

217
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
regenerative capacity and there's a

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
continuum from regrowing just the tail

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
to regrowing a whole limb to

220
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,719
kind of an extreme or a highly um

221
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,959
regenerative case like the planaria that

222
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
was studied in this paper so it's all

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,680
kind of on a continuum from total

224
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
ability to regenerate from any adult

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
somatic cell can fully recapitulate the

226
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
full population

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
all the way to a total opposite of that

228
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
and then

229
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
you pointed out that it might be related

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
to

231
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
cancer

232
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
progressions and phenotype and that

233
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
speaks to what blue brought up about the

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:10,970
um

235
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,320
[Music]

236
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
like

237
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
system level effects there's the

238
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
individual cell and there's the system

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
level because clearly there's something

240
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,959
about the

241
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
system level in the regenerative

242
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
situation that would lead to this being

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
different

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
or maybe it could be explained by just

245
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
something

246
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,399
internal to the model anyways um

247
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
you mentioned that higher information

248
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
was associated with rearrangement

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
could you explain a little bit about

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
that or how does it play out in this

251
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,480
paper or in general

252
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
yeah it's basically the um the idea that

253
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
and it's not not so much the the total

254
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,959
information content but the flow of it

255
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
and we talked a little bit about this

256
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
last time right it's hard to really

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
kind of quantify this in a in a more

258
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
meaningful biological sense but the idea

259
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
is that

260
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
it's it's information flow like i think

261
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
um dean asks a question like i said is

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
more information always good and my kind

263
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,040
of answer to that was

264
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
it's it's it's within context of what

265
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
the

266
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
what the participating autism can

267
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
receive and can process so

268
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
in the sense that if you have

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,839
you know cells that you know is

270
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
processing certain information with a

271
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,760
certain kind of rates time constants

272
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,720
then

273
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
kind of getting information in within

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
with that time frame in mind is what

275
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
what makes it

276
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
more likely for them to kind of

277
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
understand better their environment

278
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,839
and react to it as opposed to a cell you

279
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
kind of think of it also cancer cells

280
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
um that you know have the whole sensory

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
part completely perturbed that do not

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,240
react to the environment anymore

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,120
then

284
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
everything else becomes noise and it

285
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
gets ignored um

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
that's kind of the idea so there is

287
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
there is a lot of different differences

288
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
in of how the cancer cells because they

289
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
have changed ion profile iron channel

290
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
profiles have changed uh machinery of

291
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
what they're actually transcribing so

292
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
all of that leads to the difference in

293
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,680
how signals are being processed

294
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
and understanding that and then reacting

295
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,399
to that is i think is a key to to

296
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,079
understand and

297
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
treating this disease

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
awesome thanks dean

299
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
i don't know if i have the answer to my

300
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
my question um which which is how long

301
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
is a person a

302
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,800
a in finger and scare quotes a stem cell

303
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
but

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,519
one of the things you mentioned bronze

305
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,320
in the

306
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
point one was

307
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
i think steven asked the question about

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
how much volume or in the flow and what

309
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,519
i've heard you say back was um

310
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
it's always a state space dependency

311
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,480
which which i

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,839
when i'm reading the paper was i think

313
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,320
you made a really good sound

314
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
um case for that but then one of the

315
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,240
things that when you had to when you had

316
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,959
to

317
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,079
sign off

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
one of the questions that i brought up

319
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,399
hopefully that maybe we can discuss a

320
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,320
little bit today is like in figure four

321
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,519
and five

322
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,399
um

323
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,920
of the paper

324
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
all that black area around when the

325
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
sort of cells

326
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
move into into place and that's a crude

327
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
way of describing what's going on there

328
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,079
but all that black area around that

329
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
am i

330
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
is it fair to say that that's kind of

331
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,480
the

332
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
the state space dependency or is that

333
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
just assumed and how would we because

334
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,760
daniel did a good job of sort of saying

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,519
there's some invisibility aspects to

336
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,200
this when we mult do multiple layering

337
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
and so

338
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,519
how how do you give people a sense of

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
what's going on in that

340
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,600
in that black that blacked out area

341
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
right i think i think black is a good

342
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,160
a good color representation because it's

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
not really a color i don't think but it

344
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
but it kind of speaks to

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
this idea that um

346
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,200
we've got these low beliefs but how long

347
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
for how long as a person or as cells as

348
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
a cluster of cells is that beneficial

349
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
right when we're talking we're talking

350
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
of course here on under the the big

351
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
umbrella of morphology so that was kind

352
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
of where i was wondering today maybe you

353
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
could

354
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
you could explain it because you the

355
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
focus the eye tends to focus on the

356
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
object within the frame

357
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,880
as opposed to sort of the area around

358
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
the what we would consider to be the

359
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
object so

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
maybe you can kind of help me understand

361
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
this state state-space dependency piece

362
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,279
yeah i mean so

363
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,839
um if if you have a look at figure two

364
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,000
so and um what i didn't plot in the in

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
the in the figure four and five and two

366
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,480
i did is the backup concentrations right

367
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,800
so there are of course some

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
some levels of cons of signaling uh

369
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
molecules in the background as well um

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
which will also of course be the case in

371
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,079
the in the actual simulations um down

372
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
the line four and five

373
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
um the

374
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
the blackness so the one interesting

375
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
part about this simulation which was

376
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
done mainly for

377
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,560
simplicity and lack of necessity

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,639
is to not actually have an external

379
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
environment per se like there's nothing

380
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
right there's no external force like

381
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
outside of base everything in the

382
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,480
simulations is done by the cells where

383
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
the cells they make the environment

384
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
right so essentially there's an external

385
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
environment by the signaling molecules

386
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
that they put out but we don't have any

387
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,760
external um limited like limits around

388
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
it we just basically that's the space we

389
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
plot um

390
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
the signaling molecules don't go farther

391
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
than that um and there isn't any

392
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
external force um

393
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,199
which we could do right we

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
the power simulations we do this

395
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
asymmetry we essentially get uh

396
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
we get sort of an implicit environment

397
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,360
by changing the response to the signals

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,639
around each other you can imagine that

399
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
you put something in the medium that

400
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
that flips how how old signaling is

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
being processed and that's it

402
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
um so

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,160
back to your question so this about this

404
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
blackness um

405
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
and when is that beneficial if i said

406
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
that question correctly it's

407
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
there is of course like a hype like a

408
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,600
precision component to it and kind of

409
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
more

410
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,760
less hand less hand wavy if uh you know

411
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
if your environment is very volatile

412
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
and constantly changes and you keep

413
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
right you have a not not this

414
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
essentially it's a closed system right

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
if you had an open system right you

416
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
constantly would get signals also from

417
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,519
the environment this will also become

418
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,040
all a lot messier and especially

419
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,320
initially

420
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
right in the in the first frames of that

421
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
figure um four and five where we get the

422
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
simulations they all start together i

423
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
mentioned last time there are certain

424
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,759
smoothness requirements where like if we

425
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,199
had to put this dampening on the

426
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,079
sensitivity a long time so inverse

427
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
dampening it will get more sensitive

428
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
with time but just because initially

429
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,040
they're very unstructured they have you

430
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
know very low prior beliefs and they

431
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
will jump crazy if they have high

432
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
sensitive to each other because they're

433
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
in such close proximity

434
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,759
and um that is something that we of

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
course do see in biology right we do be

436
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
most um

437
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,959
especially the higher organisms right

438
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,560
they start often usually in close

439
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
environments now of course you can you

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
can argue this you don't need to go to

441
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,519
any information stuff you can argue well

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
it's just you know thermally insulated

443
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
they have their own food supplies it

444
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
makes you know just makes like a more

445
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,959
safe zone like just physically energy

446
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
speaking but i do think there's a big

447
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
component to it it's like shutting this

448
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,399
highly

449
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,040
volatile you know

450
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
it's self-inferring

451
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
organism off from influence to an

452
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,759
environment at a stage

453
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,120
when all these cells are figuring out

454
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
what to do each other so they need they

455
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
kind of need to have

456
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
a kind of a barrier between

457
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
signals from the environments which

458
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
normally you know to us adults between a

459
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
mature organism are not really dangerous

460
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
by 2n

461
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
developing organism full of stem cells

462
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
can be problematic and will basically

463
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
would um

464
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
perturb its natural kind of progression

465
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
in this states based on this sulfate

466
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,919
acquisition

467
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
there is a cool paper i can reference to

468
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
you from chris fields who i am from

469
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
disclosure i'm working with and very

470
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
much admire him

471
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
who wrote my paper about

472
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,640
motor solarity as exactly

473
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
the consequence of what i'm talking what

474
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,079
i just said the multicellularity

475
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,359
basically emerging in a as a way to

476
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
shut some cells or you know cells that

477
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,640
are

478
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
in an initial region of motility it's

479
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
also undergoing an evolution towards

480
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,559
complexity

481
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,799
needing some kind of barrier from the

482
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,960
environment basically making themselves

483
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
making creating a market bank around

484
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
them

485
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
that makes it so they're not constantly

486
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
you know being perturbed by the

487
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
environment and that's the idea of of

488
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
how my motorcycle to emotion in the

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,039
first place is to insulate

490
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
niches which will become stem cell

491
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,840
natures

492
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,160
from the environment so that

493
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
cells that are undergoing

494
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
you know very much very dynamic changes

495
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,919
in short amount of time

496
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
um that therefore need to be kind of

497
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
sensitive to the environment cannot be

498
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
need to be isolated from influence from

499
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
the environment that would perturb this

500
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
careful um inference of cell

501
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,639
type thanks dean

502
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
yeah so in this in this figure too you

503
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
can see that there's

504
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
we're talking about ranges because we've

505
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
got values

506
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
on the horizontal and the vertical

507
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
um

508
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
sides of the box

509
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
so

510
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
so one of the things that i think is

511
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
really interesting is that once you

512
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,039
so

513
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,000
you

514
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
we've all spelled it out if we're

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,039
dealing with active inference we want to

516
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,120
avoid something surprising right the

517
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
whole

518
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
the whole uh variational aspect of this

519
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
so

520
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,559
again if we're talking about going from

521
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,039
something that is has low beliefs to

522
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,320
something that

523
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
gains in in i'll say gains and

524
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
sensitivity

525
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
without hopefully killing

526
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,039
what i want to say next

527
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,240
if

528
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,799
if it's about signal adaptation to these

529
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,280
top-down conditions which

530
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
influence the final form taken

531
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
is there some way based on what you

532
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,480
researched with this paper is there some

533
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
way to know as you're approaching

534
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,400
that place of energy exhaustion like is

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,120
there something that the cell tells you

536
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
that it's it's finding this too

537
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,039
surprising because

538
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,799
one of the things we again we talked

539
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
about was that rate of change being so

540
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,679
rapid say like the u.n report on global

541
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
warming where we simply don't have the

542
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
machinery to be able to adapt is there

543
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
something that you found out through

544
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
this paper that kind of said to you

545
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,640
as you were looking at these things

546
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
oh wait a second here we're just gonna

547
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
we're gonna we're not our intent is not

548
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
to kill this thing off

549
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
but we're approaching that place where

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
the environment is just too

551
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,879
changing too fast

552
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
yeah i'm

553
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
trying to give you a more detangling

554
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
hand waviness but um let's start with

555
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
the general answer first so

556
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
um yes you do it's you can of course you

557
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
can like one way you can quickly see it

558
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
isn't that kind of like something that

559
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
you get with the picture and error plot

560
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
um that you all skip with the free

561
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
energy plot if you

562
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
um right in a perfect world you will get

563
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
like a nice move like you know

564
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
exponential decay of the free energy

565
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
function um if that keeps changing

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,840
bouncing up and down

567
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
um that will be very problematic i i did

568
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,840
some simulations afterward to not

569
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,200
include in this paper but based on

570
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
exactly the same stuff

571
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,840
um where i was including a time ver um

572
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,640
based on top of this time sensitivity um

573
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,840
you know increase so um that i use for

574
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,520
basically you know i'm increasing the

575
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
sensitivity

576
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
over the time but having a low in the

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,640
beginning on top of that i put in a an

578
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,679
impulsive like a sinusoidal or

579
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,559
a rectangular function which was um we

580
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,840
were just trying to simulate what i'm

581
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,919
doing in my in my experiments in a lab

582
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,000
where basically you know pulse certain

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
signaling

584
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
inputs to my organisms i wanted to see

585
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
basically if i randomized that or made

586
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
that in a certain certain pattern how

587
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,480
well would the simulation still be able

588
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
to cope with that and uh and

589
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,919
in the case where i had like a nice

590
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,960
regular pattern of that um you in the in

591
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
the free energy lan and the free energy

592
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
decay you hardly saw that

593
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
you know initially like initially even

594
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,159
minute since it was very high it was you

595
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,360
know you couldn't see it there there was

596
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
like a big jumpiness and fuzziness you

597
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
could see it also in the in the belief

598
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
updates uh you know

599
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
basically they were

600
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
um they kind of

601
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
emerged kind of like um they diverged

602
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,640
initially very strongly and that

603
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
diverged in terms of their beliefs

604
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
um that they had about themselves but

605
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,760
then kind of afterwards the um when the

606
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,159
sensitivity overall was kind of

607
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,120
um acclimating but was kind of varying

608
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
around this acclimation point

609
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
you didn't see that much anymore in the

610
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,080
um

611
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
in the in the in the regular pattern but

612
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,240
when the ones were less regular

613
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
um that was very much perturbed and the

614
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,559
and the fan energy also didn't actually

615
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,600
quite

616
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
uh did not only did it not um

617
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
come to kind of like uh to this

618
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
asymptotic behavior but it actually

619
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,159
started increasing again basically um

620
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,840
just was really perturbed and you didn't

621
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
see that so john's a question like um

622
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
how do you see

623
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
if if you are

624
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
not adapting correctly

625
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,200
even though you don't actually know yet

626
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
what the what your external status i

627
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
would answer it's

628
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
how much are you switching back and

629
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,640
forth between your beliefs

630
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
and uh

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
i guess more precisely also like how

632
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,679
certain are you of that right this is

633
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,840
something that we talk about in medical

634
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
immersion which i've recently from the

635
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
last people i've been getting into and

636
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
reading about metacognition and rats and

637
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,360
primates and other animals saying the

638
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
first step to metacognition is

639
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
as far as i understand it is

640
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,600
having a certain confidence about your

641
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,360
results with rats where they basically

642
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
gave rats the option in this kind of

643
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
cognitive task

644
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,039
um that they could also just not answer

645
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,520
the task not to not not push the level

646
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,720
because i think it was leverage um i

647
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,919
think what the task was but it was based

648
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,080
levers and they had an option to not

649
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,840
push a lever

650
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
for which they will get a lower reward

651
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,240
than if they um

652
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
a much lower award than if they got it

653
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
correctly but more than if they got it

654
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
wrongly and so what they saw is that

655
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
they actually would in certain certain

656
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,159
cases when you know when they hadn't

657
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,520
learned it when they hadn't learned the

658
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
task correctly they would just not push

659
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,880
the lever

660
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,400
and that is used as like a first

661
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
instance off of the medical cognition a

662
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
sense of they

663
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
must have been unsure about what you do

664
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
and then chose not to do it

665
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,600
so

666
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
i think that's kind of like if you

667
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
it's one thing if you kind of lean back

668
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,679
and forth because you always think well

669
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,520
you know i'm this and that

670
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,480
um

671
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
being unsure is normal but kind of uh

672
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
kind of uh constantly going back and

673
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
forth between certain states of

674
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
shortness is also problematic

675
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
so that's the generalized answer to this

676
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
um

677
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
yeah i think

678
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,279
i think the interesting thing there is

679
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
the emphasis on the back and forth

680
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
metaphorically speaking we tend to uh

681
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,159
give a lot of attention over to the

682
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
balance piece but what what you're

683
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
talking about when you're talking about

684
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,919
the environment is not the plank as much

685
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,520
as a moving fulcrum so how do you how do

686
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
you adjust

687
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
right

688
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
the balance i guess is the is the

689
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
outcome but it's the uh the process

690
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
itself is

691
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
the back and forth so

692
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
yeah i i wondered about that because

693
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
some things you do want and from like

694
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
from an epigenetic standpoint

695
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,120
you do want certain cells to die you

696
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
want their energy to expire

697
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
absolutely

698
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,640
right that's part of the back and forth

699
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
as opposed to the balance you know

700
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
there's no balance metaphor you want

701
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
there you want them to die yeah and

702
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
they're not dying so that's really

703
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
interesting thank you

704
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,880
now i wanted to add one one more kind of

705
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
attempt to answer more specifically is

706
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
there's a paper by uh i'm probably

707
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,400
pronouncing this name wrong drawfully

708
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
which was um

709
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
just google valence and uh active

710
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
inference

711
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,039
um they basically looked at you know

712
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
valence in terms of like um judging if

713
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,279
your actions are you know certain like

714
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,559
are they

715
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
better or worse basically is that

716
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,679
um are you you'd be assigning a a sign

717
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,080
positive or negative two to outcomes

718
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
um and they were doing that uh in the

719
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,600
active infant schemes and they were

720
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
defining it and you know there's other

721
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
definitions i'm not everyone was going

722
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
to be about this but they were looking

723
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,640
at it in an infant scheme about the rate

724
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
of change they were looking at the first

725
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
and second order derivatives

726
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,240
um of um how

727
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,799
i'm saying this correctly um

728
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,440
about how the

729
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
prior beliefs were updated to the

730
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
position that how how important like how

731
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
how sure they were about what cell type

732
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
there were and so basically in the

733
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
segment order derivative basically how

734
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,559
much would they change at any given time

735
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,919
in their beliefs

736
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
that's what they um what they plugged in

737
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
valence into different mode it gets more

738
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
complex than that but that's the gist of

739
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,159
it

740
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,559
so um that i think is a

741
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
in the within the frame of active

742
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
inference is a more specific answer your

743
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,799
question is

744
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,279
look at the the rate of change by which

745
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
your beliefs are

746
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
updating

747
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,919
and that with respect to your

748
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
uncertainty of course um there's this

749
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,200
whole

750
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,919
um cause i've written about this as well

751
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,840
um i'm very interested as well from the

752
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
browse standpoint of you is that stress

753
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
stress sensing mechanisms like stress is

754
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,600
a universal um driver

755
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
um in biology it's actually much more

756
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,960
important than rewards i kind of find

757
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
that we are talking about rewards but um

758
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
biology is much more focused on on

759
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
stress

760
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
um because it's more informative and

761
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,320
it's more important to deal with than

762
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,559
than what maximizing but of course you

763
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
always say it's just a negative but

764
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
the the point that being is

765
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
uh stress as in terms of for uncertainty

766
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,080
like not having not minimizing your

767
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
energy effectively and stably

768
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
um that will lead to stress and there's

769
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
paper that doesn't humans i think i

770
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,360
mentioned the last time as well what

771
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
they do experiments with humans

772
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,520
and mice as well were they

773
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
very ethical where they shocked um they

774
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,279
give the electric shocks i think they're

775
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,960
both mice and humans

776
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,520
um and then they showed that the

777
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
level so they were more stressed out not

778
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
just by this like the sharks themselves

779
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
but they couldn't predict

780
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,720
um the electric shocks so it's that

781
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
uncertainty of what coming next i think

782
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
that is the most

783
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
if i had to like say one thing that is

784
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,880
most negative of uh of you're going in a

785
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
bad place

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
so if you are stressed because you have

787
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
no idea what's happening and you cannot

788
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
even if you know something that's going

789
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
to happen you know when it's happening

790
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,760
that's a lot less bad than if you don't

791
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,120
know at all

792
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,520
um one last really dark example to

793
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
really make this a dark place is there

794
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,480
is a i'm from um i was born east germany

795
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
um

796
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
i guess i was only when you open the

797
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
wall fell so um but we you know my

798
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,559
parents were very much and

799
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,600
there was uh this um now it's a museum

800
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
but it was a prison

801
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
for the the basically political

802
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
detainees in east germany and east

803
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,320
berlin

804
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,720
and we went there as a class once and um

805
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,159
they showed us all the things all the

806
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,320
techniques they used to interrogate

807
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
um prisoners including torture and one

808
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
of the torture devices

809
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
um was i believe a japanese device where

810
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
you would

811
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,960
get you put your head down on

812
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
this device and there's a

813
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
water that's dropping from the top onto

814
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
your neck

815
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,159
so you think at this point like uh it

816
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,320
doesn't sound too bad right the problem

817
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
was is that the drops you know there's

818
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,039
um

819
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,640
there's a lot of viscosity in there so

820
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
um you know a lot of kind of

821
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,279
fluctuations so the drops wouldn't

822
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,520
always come at the same time and it kept

823
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,679
repeating repelling um happening over

824
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,080
time and time again so what the and the

825
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,360
prisoners actually people that used to

826
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,559
be in prison they were actually one was

827
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,760
giving the tour

828
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,279
so they were telling us yeah if you

829
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,360
under the device after a couple hours or

830
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
so these drops will feel like hammers on

831
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,799
your on your neck

832
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,919
and apparently a big component of that

833
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
was the um

834
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,000
not the the body not being able to adapt

835
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,840
to it because you know the drops don't

836
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
come at a perfect five second interval

837
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,720
it happens kind of at some fast

838
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
randomized um intervals

839
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,039
so um

840
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,320
that i think there's a huge part in and

841
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,399
not just looking at stress over time but

842
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,600
how

843
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
you can adapt that stress and in order

844
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
to adapt to stress adaptation to me

845
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
always involves a component of

846
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
prediction if you can't predict the

847
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
source of the stress when it happens

848
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
it makes things a lot worse this has

849
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
been shown extensively in humans and

850
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
also in

851
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,480
in lower organisms

852
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
and i believe um very strongly that

853
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
there's something fundamental to any

854
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,480
biological system to fundamental drive

855
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,679
if you if you view if you

856
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,520
you describe to the point of view that

857
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
um minimizing uncertainty in the

858
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
environment is a fundamental drive of

859
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
life

860
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,960
then

861
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,440
with that you prescribe that minimizing

862
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
stress and the source of stress over

863
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
time and being able to predict it is

864
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,320
also fundamental and lacto of makes a

865
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,600
very dangerous system

866
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
blue thanks

867
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
so all that's super interesting um just

868
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,600
okay so let me i'm going to start at the

869
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,840
front and work backwards so in terms of

870
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
uncertainty and um

871
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,440
how that's what causes stress

872
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,840
uh i'm really kind of i don't know

873
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,159
reluctant to use the word stress in a

874
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,159
biological system like i think about

875
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
stressing a biological system is like

876
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,200
pushing it out of equilibrium um

877
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
but but maybe that's just a stimulus

878
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,960
right like i want you to rebalance and

879
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,279
go to like a new equilibrium like or

880
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,919
like turn on heat shock protein or you

881
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,200
know there's a variety of different

882
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
things like many ways you can view

883
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,679
stress as a stimulus to do something new

884
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,960
or to perturb the system in a new way um

885
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,799
but but in terms of uncertainty i think

886
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
that there's a lot of truth in

887
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
um

888
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,640
how uncomfortable

889
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
people are with uncertainty like at a

890
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
cognitive level and you can even see it

891
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
like in the stock market before like the

892
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
election is in before the election

893
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
results like the stock market goes crazy

894
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
and because nobody knows i mean it's not

895
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,559
that one candidate is preferable over

896
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,640
the other but it's just the unknowing is

897
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
very

898
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,640
um

899
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,360
like

900
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
people freak out

901
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,559
so so and that speaks i think to

902
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,240
metacognition

903
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,919
also um

904
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,000
and then so i i wanted to back up a

905
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
little bit if i can

906
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,559
um to your discussion of information

907
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,840
flow

908
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
and how that might be difficult to

909
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,679
quantify and daniel i don't know can you

910
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,000
flip to the section for me please on um

911
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
the generalized flow section i think we

912
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,519
started to get into that a little bit

913
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,720
last week and

914
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,440
we did discuss it in the dot zero but i

915
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,039
have like i i know that this is very um

916
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,720
mathematically technical and so i just

917
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
have a little bit of of questions about

918
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,120
um this and maybe

919
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,200
you can help explain it in a way that's

920
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,679
perhaps less technical but specifically

921
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,919
information flow and chris fields is

922
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,960
coming uh to discuss the fep for generic

923
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,279
quantum systems next week and so i can i

924
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
can similarly interrogate him about

925
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
about some of this stuff uh and i'm

926
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
looking forward to it but um

927
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,320
you know we have a discussion there's a

928
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,840
discussion in the paper about the

929
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
probability flow

930
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
um

931
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,360
and

932
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,080
information like a probability current i

933
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,240
think is actually what is used and

934
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
getting into

935
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
information currents like if you look up

936
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
what is an information current i think

937
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
um there's like the idea of the von

938
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
neumann information current and um that

939
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,720
like is explicitly related to quantum

940
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,799
systems so is there any similar like do

941
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,480
we have a way to measure information

942
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
current because even when mike came to

943
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,480
the live stream and talked about um

944
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,200
um expanding cognition biological

945
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
cognition computational boundary of

946
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
itself there was sorry um but when you

947
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
expand biological cognition like there's

948
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,840
you know you're basically expanding your

949
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
informational awareness and so is there

950
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,559
anything like an information current or

951
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,120
how can you best relate that within a

952
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,799
biological system is it like an

953
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,600
expansion of your computational boundary

954
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
or does it look like just more

955
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,879
information goes in and comes out

956
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,919
i think it's

957
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,360
uh it depends on what

958
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
depends on what level you're looking at

959
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,480
i would say it's both um so

960
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,799
the the the second part you mentioned

961
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,240
that the information flow comes in and

962
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
out that's something we just have more

963
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
access to biologically speaking

964
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,039
experimentally right

965
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,000
um

966
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
and you can absolutely you know you can

967
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,840
you can look at you know you have all

968
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,560
these

969
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
uh sensors for for for sensors for

970
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
receptors being activated for

971
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,918
um

972
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,879
genetic um transcription

973
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,879
in response to that so so that's

974
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,639
something that we can you have the best

975
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,280
chance of quantifying experimentally

976
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,000
and in terms of computationally it's

977
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,639
something you can monitor and then also

978
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,399
couple that with what chris fields um

979
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,359
good thing you mentioned that because

980
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,199
then i can relate to him that's

981
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,560
basically what he's also very interested

982
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
in right like how how does physical

983
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,320
energy of course played all all into

984
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,159
this with the mid and embarrassing

985
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,879
metabolism right now this comes for free

986
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,320
that's something that biologists often

987
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,040
kind of um not broad it's actually no

988
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
theoretical we're all just often kept

989
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,599
under under the table because the idea

990
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,480
is that energy is abundant and uh and in

991
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
in life which is to extend true right

992
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
there's plenty of sunlight there's

993
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,320
plenty of things to spend food around

994
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,040
um but at the same time

995
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,359
locally just with entropy

996
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,680
there is a strong competition there so

997
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,359
just because you are living in a

998
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,960
reservoir that has plenty of food and

999
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,200
sunlight that doesn't mean that you

1000
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
locally are gonna gonna survive because

1001
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,920
of people locally competing with you the

1002
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
same is true right i mean uh this is

1003
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
always like when you talk to

1004
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
um when you talk to people that people

1005
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
that you know have

1006
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
problems the idea of um

1007
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,440
what why does entropy i don't want to

1008
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,520
say names but if you

1009
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
that's saying that entropy is always

1010
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,880
increased if chaos in the universe

1011
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
increases how do we see

1012
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
much more structure evolving and then um

1013
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
the of course the answer to that is that

1014
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
well just like in a path of water if you

1015
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,400
have certain oil droplets are going to

1016
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,560
come together because overall that makes

1017
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,240
that gives more degrees of freedom for

1018
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,320
all the water molecules so the entire

1019
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,040
entire system entropy did increase but

1020
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
you managed to find a

1021
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
solution that does increase that by

1022
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,560
locally creating more order that's the

1023
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
drive of um

1024
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,800
i think of life overall the quote that

1025
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,480
probably the talk that got me into

1026
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,119
biology is was from a biophysicist in

1027
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,359
heidelberg was saying life is not about

1028
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
energy it's for entropy

1029
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,480
um

1030
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
but

1031
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,760
the two come together right yes it's

1032
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
about how much information is available

1033
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,560
but then by extent of that once you are

1034
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,160
subscribed to that once you have to form

1035
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,320
these localized structures then energy

1036
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,079
becomes important again

1037
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
um so and that's what i think is needed

1038
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,040
right now when you have this high view

1039
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,440
highly spatially organized systems

1040
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
energy suddenly does become

1041
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
something that is valuable again

1042
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,479
um

1043
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
yeah i think i kind of lost my train of

1044
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
thought there

1045
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,200
um the

1046
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,720
the boundary yourself that's right your

1047
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
the other information flow that was the

1048
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,359
part about information but we can

1049
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,359
measure that um we have good ideas what

1050
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,359
was what's lacking is

1051
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,560
and uh quantum understanding of of

1052
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,280
how metabolism is really hooked into the

1053
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,720
information flow

1054
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,240
whether or not it's built into the model

1055
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,839
or whether it's ad hoc just down down

1056
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,280
the line you give it certain resources

1057
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
after a while it just exploits them the

1058
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,000
boundary itself is interesting because

1059
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,359
and of course in the cell we think well

1060
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,839
we have a you know there's a membrane

1061
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,520
the boundary of itself is very fairly

1062
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,480
obvious

1063
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
it's not as easy as that i think and of

1064
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,920
course if you look at two multicellular

1065
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,160
organisms it becomes um you know a

1066
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
tissue scale then that becomes a lot

1067
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,440
more difficult but even on a cellular

1068
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
level

1069
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
if you have certain receptors um you

1070
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
know you have certain activations of it

1071
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
then

1072
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
a modern energy generator of general

1073
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,680
monologues in the active inference

1074
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,040
scheme but especially an iterative

1075
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,599
stream you also have a model of yourself

1076
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,520
right and if

1077
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,839
at what point

1078
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,760
your own your own what you're what

1079
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,079
you're secreting your own your signals

1080
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,079
that you secrete also feedback into what

1081
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
you're sensing after all

1082
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,640
so it is kind of thought that that that

1083
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
whole system is very much perturbed in

1084
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,040
cancer cells as well where

1085
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
the

1086
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,359
how much like is it is are you actually

1087
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,640
receiving things from the environment

1088
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
are you basically just

1089
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,560
uh secreting and secreting and you don't

1090
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,320
really react to it anymore

1091
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,560
so the the boundary of self what what

1092
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,079
mike might already talked about this

1093
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,000
here will be have been much more than i

1094
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
can be about this but the idea is

1095
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
the boundary itself is encoded

1096
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,119
specifically with time and spatial

1097
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,800
constraints so like how much you're

1098
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,640
burning yourself what you want yourself

1099
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
might be more general about this

1100
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,079
yourself model depends

1101
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,720
very much on your sensual or your

1102
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,839
sensory

1103
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,480
memory like how how far do you sense and

1104
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
how and spatially how how much water can

1105
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,599
you sense and how much back do you have

1106
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,160
encoded as memory how much are effects

1107
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,359
in the past um um persisting so that you

1108
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,040
know so even though if you have a cell

1109
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
there's a certain membrane

1110
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,040
if if that cell does not actually keep

1111
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,760
any track if that cell is not somehow a

1112
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
sensing or beyond a certain boundary and

1113
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
then it creates on boundary by these

1114
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,520
highly peripheral cells that are

1115
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,119
basically surrounding themselves with

1116
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,200
each other then suddenly the environment

1117
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,760
becomes mute um so the boundary of the

1118
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
self has essentially expanded i would

1119
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,960
argue

1120
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,920
um

1121
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,160
i think that's kind of the the thought

1122
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
train here i

1123
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,240
i'm just hope that was some way i would

1124
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,839
answer the question

1125
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,599
awesome blue

1126
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,880
so um just i was curious um you

1127
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,040
mentioned that there was a talk that um

1128
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,119
got you hooked into biology was it eric

1129
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,160
smith and his discussion of biology and

1130
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,640
entropy because that's also fabulous

1131
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
it was not i'm real just saying that was

1132
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,960
um

1133
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,640
damn that's really embarrassing that the

1134
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,000
guy i don't remember right now the name

1135
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,680
of the person that got me into biologies

1136
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,440
ugh it's as i speak english right now

1137
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,720
it's all in german back then and always

1138
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
kind of my brain then has problems

1139
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
switching between those two and content

1140
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,320
as well as language um it'll come back

1141
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,200
to me

1142
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
probably within this talk

1143
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,400
eric smith does a wonderful job though

1144
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,960
of um you know discussing biology in

1145
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
terms of entropy and so if you are not

1146
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,920
familiar with this work i would just

1147
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,640
highly recommend it yeah

1148
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,240
that really

1149
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,359
reflects on our um discussion what parts

1150
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,680
of the self model are important to carry

1151
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
forward

1152
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,839
and then what are the affordances for

1153
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,720
direct and indirect

1154
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,359
self-modification

1155
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,720
so that's one

1156
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,040
piece like you mentioned the autocrine

1157
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
signaling and that's not even a

1158
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,960
contentious component it just is being

1159
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,480
modeled in a different way with active

1160
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,560
inference rather than just a molecular

1161
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,640
event that's happening that like cells

1162
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,880
secrete molecules that they also possess

1163
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,640
receptors

1164
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,200
to measure it's just putting that into a

1165
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,079
framework of reflexive self-modeling and

1166
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,560
stigmargy and niche modification here

1167
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,960
but just one other point that i thought

1168
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
was really

1169
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,240
maybe useful to highlight was this

1170
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,480
sensitivity and just like many of the

1171
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
terms in actin for kind of seeing that

1172
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
there is a

1173
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,720
narrow or a quantitative sense and then

1174
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,920
there's a broader sense because in any

1175
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
dynamical systems model you might hear

1176
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,880
about

1177
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,119
sensitivity of the parameter which is

1178
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,599
how much changing that parameter changes

1179
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,520
the outcome of the system

1180
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,839
and so that's a quantitative sense

1181
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,839
and then also

1182
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,839
it was brought up that it's important to

1183
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,920
model these like second order

1184
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,680
derivatives like how fast are things

1185
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,880
changing relative to expectations or how

1186
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,000
fast are they changing how they're

1187
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,040
changing

1188
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,560
and

1189
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,040
that is what the generalized flow is

1190
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,599
it's all those higher derivatives

1191
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,319
so

1192
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,319
we can use that quantitative sense of

1193
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,960
sensitivity to look at how parameter

1194
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
changes in the generalized coordinates

1195
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
of motion matter

1196
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
but also we can

1197
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
perhaps with cognitive modeling

1198
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,280
take this discussion of sensitivity in

1199
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
the way that people are usually meaning

1200
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,920
it

1201
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,440
like sensitivity of what is seen on

1202
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
someone's emotional state

1203
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,160
and then model that using cognitive

1204
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,359
parameters

1205
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,280
like valence and affect

1206
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
even though that's

1207
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,839
quite a disjoint use from the parameter

1208
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,280
sensitivity

1209
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
discussion on the generalized

1210
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,400
coordinates

1211
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,200
so

1212
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
it's was an awesome discussion with like

1213
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,839
what is stress

1214
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,200
and how does that relate to the

1215
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,760
parametric sort of neutral perspective

1216
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,240
on what stress or sensitivity what might

1217
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
mean

1218
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
just the model descriptive

1219
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,760
versus some of these

1220
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,680
functional

1221
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
or

1222
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
um phenomenological even

1223
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,119
ways that these terms come into play

1224
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,839
blue

1225
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
so that's super interesting thinking

1226
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,800
about uh sensitivity and

1227
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,119
stress in just in terms of cognition

1228
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,640
right like so i know like people that

1229
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,119
have sensory processing disorders get

1230
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,800
like super aggravated by something like

1231
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,280
a bright light or like a windy day

1232
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,920
um and just how how sensitivity does

1233
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,800
play into maybe the flow of of

1234
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,160
information like

1235
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,480
because you know i'm suddenly sensitive

1236
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,880
to this then i'm also sensitized to

1237
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
every other thing in my environment like

1238
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,079
someone's screaming over here and it's

1239
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,160
windy and it's hot and it's bright and

1240
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,839
then like i become just so over

1241
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,359
stimulated right like people have these

1242
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,040
these processing things and

1243
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,880
it's sensory

1244
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,800
is that something that like has momentum

1245
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,160
right like so you have enhanced

1246
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,839
sensitivity and does that just like then

1247
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,599
all of a sudden you're just you're so

1248
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,760
sensitive like we hear people say stuff

1249
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
like that like stop being so sensitive

1250
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
um just in terms of cognitive processing

1251
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,240
i thought that that was um

1252
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,079
just super interesting

1253
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,440
i think that's an excellent point i mean

1254
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,280
that's that's something that that that

1255
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
shows exactly how important it is for

1256
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,200
humans right you're gonna argue low

1257
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,160
levels as well um and in the evolution

1258
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
to be able to model our sensitive

1259
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
actually change our sensitivity right we

1260
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,640
would never be able to have

1261
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
conversations in our environments if we

1262
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,760
couldn't change

1263
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,359
consciously our

1264
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,680
and sometimes subconsciously as well

1265
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,240
our sensitivity parameters and um

1266
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,000
i think

1267
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,839
that's something also then also feeds

1268
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,680
into metacognition right you learn like

1269
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,520
oh well um i'm not paying attention

1270
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,560
enough so something to pay more

1271
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,079
attention to uh

1272
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,359
you're trying to tune this in and i

1273
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,400
think that's

1274
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,599
the

1275
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,760
in the sense of on the cellular level i

1276
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,200
think what where that feeds in is

1277
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
the

1278
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,119
is by learning over time right by how

1279
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,040
much being how many receptors are being

1280
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
activated how does that defeat in

1281
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,280
downstream then there is this component

1282
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
where essentially the the cell can upper

1283
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,760
sensitivity by expressing more receptors

1284
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,520
by if though if it's not understanding

1285
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,640
it's it's uh it's inputs it can increase

1286
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,480
those proteins they're responsible for

1287
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
sensing these things

1288
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,319
um and there's also different if you

1289
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,960
talk about ion channels specifically

1290
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,560
that we work with that there are

1291
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
different versions of iron channels that

1292
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,920
have different rate constants

1293
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,319
um the same is true for other um

1294
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,319
uh for for active proteins as well such

1295
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,000
as pumps so that becomes an a lot more

1296
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,800
you know explicitly

1297
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,839
um modulating sensitivity over time

1298
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,160
in a way to um to you know better react

1299
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,920
and cope with uh adapt to its

1300
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,599
environment again adaptation keep in

1301
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,280
mind involves prediction in most cases

1302
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,960
if not explicitly then basically

1303
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,160
awesome and by the way um then the guy

1304
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,599
is michael houseman and heidelberg

1305
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,119
before i turn around my grave

1306
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,520
oh that was the person coming to physics

1307
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,560
to biology biophysics

1308
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,520
cool

1309
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,800
um

1310
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,400
just to kind of connect that change in

1311
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,480
sensitivity to some of those mechanisms

1312
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,359
so

1313
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,319
if it's the sensitivity to a given

1314
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,400
hormone or a given circulating molecule

1315
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
then that sometimes gets accomplished

1316
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,079
biologically by changes in like the

1317
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,800
membrane receptor density or changes in

1318
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
downstream signaling pathways so even if

1319
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,040
the amount of receptor in the membrane

1320
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,440
stays constant it's like you can release

1321
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,040
more of the neurotransmitter in the

1322
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,880
synapse or you could have more or less

1323
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,359
receptors or you could have more or less

1324
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
of all these regulators and

1325
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,079
phosphorylating proteins etc in the

1326
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,240
downstream signaling pathways because

1327
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,440
there's a

1328
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,359
lot of complexity in that space but

1329
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,319
there's a lot of knobs including rates

1330
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,160
of change in rates of rates of change

1331
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,839
and lag effects with transcription

1332
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:42,880
factors

1333
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,720
and all this other

1334
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,640
basically any

1335
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,880
thing is possible

1336
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,720
and then at the organism level just to

1337
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,240
give one and then anyone else maybe at

1338
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,200
the some other level like

1339
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,560
it's kind of like

1340
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,480
a nest may ant being sensitive to

1341
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,079
interactions

1342
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,160
and then a nurse

1343
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,319
who's a younger aunt is like initially

1344
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,000
more susceptible or more sensitive

1345
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,079
due to multiple reasons like at the

1346
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,160
antenna at the brain

1347
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,720
in just spatially where the nurse is and

1348
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
then there's this

1349
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,280
um

1350
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,960
development towards being a forager

1351
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,119
being sensitive to forage or cues

1352
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,200
finding oneself in spaces where there

1353
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,079
are forage or cues that are useful

1354
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,680
so there's a lot of ways that these

1355
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,359
changes in the type

1356
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,200
of sensitivity

1357
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,040
again are already things that we talk

1358
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,079
about

1359
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,040
in developmental biology

1360
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,119
and so it's so cool to see how that is

1361
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,520
connected to the molecular mechanism

1362
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,680
the affective angle

1363
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,119
and then

1364
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,880
with the underpinning of the generalized

1365
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,880
flow

1366
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,439
yeah

1367
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,839
so you guys can push push back on this

1368
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,559
heart if you want but it's interesting i

1369
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,400
one of the

1370
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,559
terms that i coined was that stress

1371
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,440
programming or at least programming

1372
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,720
with stress

1373
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
assumed was basically learning either

1374
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,680
formally or informally

1375
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,520
that's what it is because there's a

1376
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,119
certain amount of stress involved be it

1377
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,640
positive or

1378
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,079
negative but i kind of

1379
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,920
threw that through that

1380
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,000
viewfinder i think it's interesting that

1381
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,920
back to the back and forth thing

1382
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
stress programming can be safer

1383
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
or it can be riskier

1384
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,160
and you know as long as it's not sort of

1385
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,760
killing the learner

1386
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
if safer in the sense of

1387
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,440
as intervention

1388
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,760
i think this paper

1389
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,839
showed that you can intervene

1390
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,880
but riskier is as distribution like

1391
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,559
sending something

1392
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,240
out into the unknown it can be safer as

1393
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,200
teaching

1394
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,400
or taught

1395
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,880
it can also be riskier as i'm teaching

1396
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,160
or untaught

1397
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,920
sort of just sort of throwing somebody

1398
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,440
into a situation

1399
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,000
and see whether they can paddle

1400
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,079
or not

1401
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,720
the last thing is it can also be seen as

1402
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,520
both modeling in the safer sense because

1403
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,319
we've

1404
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,960
reduced some of the variation

1405
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,079
or it can also be riskier as in terms of

1406
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,520
coordinating

1407
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,079
meaning the person has to kind of figure

1408
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,400
it out as they're flying the plane

1409
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,839
so

1410
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,920
i wonder what you guys think do you

1411
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,440
think that

1412
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,000
can we is there some agreement that

1413
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,839
learning in general

1414
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,559
be it formalized or informalized

1415
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,520
has has an aspect of stress programming

1416
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,880
that kind of

1417
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,800
is assumed or

1418
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,839
from my way out

1419
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,000
awesome

1420
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,119
question

1421
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,880
um blue or franz what do you think

1422
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,920
um i i don't think you're off it's this

1423
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,040
there's definitely of course you know

1424
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
that there's explicit uh incorporations

1425
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,480
of stress until learning but your

1426
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,960
question i think is like is it is kind

1427
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,880
of always simplicity there even if not

1428
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,079
explicitly

1429
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,720
so one one interesting kind of effect

1430
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,640
this blue mentioned earlier that stress

1431
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
you know can be interpreted as like

1432
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,319
human perceived stress hormones but it

1433
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,800
can also just be like perturbation from

1434
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,280
from equilibrium from homeostasis

1435
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
um and they actually do kind of this

1436
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,960
this has been breached this has been

1437
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
combined and homeostatic reinforcement

1438
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,200
learning where they kind of implicitly

1439
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,240
explicitly make the reward and reward

1440
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,680
based you know reinforcement learning

1441
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,559
about the homeostatic off point

1442
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,480
and then stress becomes suddenly a lot

1443
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,839
more explicit

1444
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,000
in that sense of perturbation from from

1445
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,319
your homostatic set point

1446
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,200
um

1447
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
in the in the active inference scheme

1448
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,480
stress is basically just your

1449
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,839
you could just define it basically as

1450
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,200
your you know your overall um

1451
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,119
difference and again like with those

1452
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,720
fans i was talking about like how much

1453
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
is your is your is your private belief

1454
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,960
certainty changing are you minimizing

1455
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,160
uncertainty um over time or not

1456
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,040
um

1457
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,000
it is it is hard

1458
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
i think it's hard it's hard both to

1459
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,480
completely

1460
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,040
uh say stress is not involved and

1461
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
without saying that

1462
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,319
while you're just calling everything

1463
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,319
stressed but it kind of it's really it

1464
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,000
depends on what how you define the

1465
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,920
stress but if you think if you go score

1466
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,000
something like as in like you stress as

1467
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,839
you're not right now in an energy

1468
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,920
minimized state you're not in a an

1469
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,000
active infant scheme or you're not in a

1470
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
 point in a more basic scheme

1471
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,920
then stress is i would argue you bring

1472
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
into some learning yes

1473
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,760
because without that if they don't have

1474
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,960
the difference to that if you don't

1475
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,839
actually

1476
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,760
if you don't have any drive to learn

1477
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,200
because you're not you know you think

1478
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,440
your everything is perfect

1479
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,079
then it's hard to to have learning so

1480
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,599
specifically if learning is about

1481
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,599
with the environment and context what is

1482
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,119
your why getting into your environment i

1483
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,760
trying to adapt to it as i try to

1484
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
learning in a sense of like adapt to it

1485
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,000
um and find a certain equilibrium with

1486
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,880
it

1487
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,200
then i think stress becomes very much

1488
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,319
explicit

1489
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,240
and it's ubiquitous

1490
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,440
in learning

1491
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,280
okay i just want to add one thing that's

1492
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,440
perfect because i always talk about the

1493
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,960
minimum of two and i think you i think

1494
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,720
you're absolutely right friends i think

1495
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,559
you have to then look at stress as being

1496
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,520
either voluntary or involuntary i think

1497
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,280
that's the minimum of two that you have

1498
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,200
to look at because i think if you have

1499
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
voluntary stress

1500
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,640
it's it's it's

1501
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,640
it's measurably different than the

1502
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
involuntary type

1503
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,839
so

1504
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,520
yeah you're right i don't think it's i

1505
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,960
don't think we can just throw under

1506
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,119
everything under one umbrella and make

1507
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,880
it a monolith i think we have to

1508
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
partition it right from the very get-go

1509
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,000
and say

1510
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,240
um all programming be it a curriculum

1511
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,640
whatever whatever the curriculum is

1512
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,240
that those stem cells have

1513
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,760
that's some of it's going to be

1514
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,040
voluntary and some of it's going to be

1515
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,440
involuntary based on the situation that

1516
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,520
they're they're placed in

1517
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
so again i wasn't trying to pull it in

1518
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,720
that direction but

1519
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,319
i didn't bring up stress but i really

1520
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,279
liked that it was brought up

1521
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,559
so okay yeah blue blue

1522
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,480
sorry so just um from a

1523
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,880
neuroscience perspective

1524
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,640
um it's interesting

1525
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,160
like the voluntary and involuntary

1526
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,839
stress thing is so different and i feel

1527
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,200
like maybe daniel will remember we

1528
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,960
discussed that at some point like when

1529
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,720
you're exposed to a stress that like you

1530
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,079
do to yourself on purpose like your

1531
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,440
strength training or something like that

1532
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,480
versus

1533
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,680
um you know some some externally imposed

1534
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,200
stress that you didn't volunteer for i

1535
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,720
think that that has a difference in

1536
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,640
affect i feel like we looked at a paper

1537
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,839
i can't remember off the top of my head

1538
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,839
though um but

1539
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,559
in terms of sensory processing

1540
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,720
it's really interesting in neuroscience

1541
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,160
we actually adapt

1542
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,319
right so so you can listen to like you

1543
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,000
this is a great example like you turn on

1544
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,079
the car radio and like you're listening

1545
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,400
jamming out in the car for i don't know

1546
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,559
a while 20 minutes 30 minutes and then

1547
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,640
suddenly it doesn't seem as loud and so

1548
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,880
you turn it up and then you're jamming

1549
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,319
out jamming out jumping out and still it

1550
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,000
doesn't seem as loud so you turn it up

1551
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,240
because the same level of stimulus

1552
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,480
produces a decreasing

1553
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,839
sensation

1554
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,079
um and that's true in terms of you know

1555
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,440
visual like when you first turn on the

1556
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,640
leg you're like oh it's so bright but

1557
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,280
then you adapt and so in in terms of

1558
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,240
sensory processing we have a mechanism

1559
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,760
for adaptation um and i i wonder about

1560
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,640
actually cells like not neurons because

1561
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,240
this is like i'm specifically talking

1562
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,160
about like a sensory processing way but

1563
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,599
i wonder if cells do the same thing i

1564
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
mean i guess like you know the receptor

1565
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,440
shuts or the receptors triggered and

1566
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,760
then it can't get activated again for

1567
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,599
some certain amount of time so even just

1568
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,760
receptor binding in and of itself is

1569
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,520
like an adaptation mechanism like you

1570
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,760
can't constantly like dump the chemical

1571
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,359
into the receptor open the channel or

1572
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,960
whatever like that's not

1573
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,599
like biochemically possible

1574
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,119
but but i wonder if

1575
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040
um you know

1576
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,200
cells have some other adaptation

1577
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,000
mechanism outside of this um like

1578
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,640
channel opening or closing or just this

1579
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,960
is there more than like the

1580
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,119
mechanodynamics of the channel that um

1581
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,280
enables cellular adaptation

1582
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,160
um i i can think of a couple ones um but

1583
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,359
no one expert on this but um there's

1584
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,880
right you can think of first like on the

1585
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,040
episode on the epigenetic level if you

1586
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,640
basically just um

1587
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,760
you know

1588
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,599
recruit more histones basically have a

1589
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,960
more tightly packed chromosome you're

1590
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,720
gonna have less genetic expression no

1591
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,559
matter what kind of signaling input you

1592
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,960
get to the nucleus that's whenever i can

1593
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,160
think of it

1594
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,720
um another one is uh

1595
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,559
mechanically so

1596
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,280
the right lot most of the

1597
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,480
i hope i'm not

1598
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,920
over generalizing but i think most of

1599
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,160
the you know signaling against that

1600
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,839
receptors are sensing and then has to be

1601
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,920
transported to the nucleus somehow to to

1602
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,319
cause transcription that is usually

1603
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,839
directed right that has to correct up

1604
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,400
across cytoskeleton so if you change the

1605
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,720
mechanical properties of status skeleton

1606
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,760
itself

1607
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,640
um

1608
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,000
and uh

1609
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,839
not again yeah i'm out of my league but

1610
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,359
um that's something i could very well

1611
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,680
imagine um i want to ask someone that's

1612
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,000
my smile on that topic

1613
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,200
um

1614
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,680
lastly

1615
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,839
it's if you talk in in the intercell

1616
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,160
intercellular context then

1617
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,440
you know um

1618
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,839
things like uh you know what we and no

1619
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,520
in neuronal context you have these you

1620
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,839
know the synapses in the non-neural

1621
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,599
context you still have gap junctions and

1622
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,760
other complexes that basically allow

1623
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,440
transport between cells

1624
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,240
and those can also be modulated um by

1625
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,079
the cell so then there you can also get

1626
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,640
habituation and definitely no examples

1627
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,720
where people have shown habituation

1628
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
and uh even other um there's active

1629
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,200
research on on on showing that there's

1630
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,799
more just habituation but also actually

1631
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,880
the learning offer of a certain pattern

1632
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,119
as well

1633
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,480
i think that's true

1634
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,599
so i'm really interested in the

1635
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,400
cytoskeleton um because a lot of you

1636
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,079
know i mean the receptors are in the

1637
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,079
membrane embedded in the membrane but we

1638
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,920
don't really there's not a lot of work

1639
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,920
that looks at like the cytoskeletal

1640
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,359
dynamics

1641
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,680
with respect to um like modulation of

1642
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,359
receptor dynamics right right so like

1643
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,200
that's a field that i think or i haven't

1644
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,760
seen very much work um in terms of how

1645
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,240
does this the underlying cytoskeleton

1646
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,400
contribute to the properties of the

1647
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,160
membrane and how a cell might be

1648
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,000
behaving and just in terms of like you

1649
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,200
know things having to get into the

1650
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,240
nucleus i don't know

1651
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,880
i'm iffy on that one um i i think and

1652
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,480
it's just because i did very early work

1653
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,240
like transfecting cells in a variety of

1654
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,680
different ways and you know to get a

1655
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,119
gene into the

1656
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,640
into the cell to get the cell to express

1657
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,839
the gene you have to get it through the

1658
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,839
nucleus right how does it get into the

1659
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,079
nucleus like nobody can answer you

1660
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,359
so like if it doesn't have a nuclear

1661
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,280
target on it like how is it going so is

1662
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,440
it just like osmosing itself through or

1663
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,920
or like like just how is that exactly

1664
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,119
happening and so you call the vendor

1665
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,559
like oh i'm trying to use your product

1666
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,240
whether you're electroporating or you

1667
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,760
know using some kind of lipid mediated

1668
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,200
transduction they don't know they have

1669
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,760
no idea actually so it's just a super

1670
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,640
interesting um prospect and i think that

1671
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,559
in terms of both that and the

1672
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,079
cytoskeleton there's a lot of like

1673
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,799
dynamic remodeling that occurs during

1674
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,200
cell cycles right like during the phases

1675
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,880
you know like when a cell is dividing

1676
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,359
and growing and becoming two cells uh um

1677
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,000
there's and so like the nuclear membrane

1678
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
that's the point

1679
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,880
but in terms of terminally

1680
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,640
differentiated cells like a neuron or

1681
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,480
something that's not undergoing you know

1682
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,319
constant change in remodeling

1683
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,359
it's curious to see how that can happen

1684
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,000
um and i'm interested if anybody has any

1685
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,400
any good like hardcore mechanistic

1686
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,160
papers that you want to point out to me

1687
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,760
or or if anybody listening in the live

1688
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,839
stream wants to drop them in the youtube

1689
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,359
chat i would really love to take a look

1690
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,440
at them

1691
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,359
hill

1692
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,359
i really like dean returning to this uh

1693
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,160
idea that there's the

1694
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,040
there's a continuum or there's multiple

1695
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,640
archetype dimensions so not that it's

1696
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,640
all going to map on to just two but we

1697
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,480
know it's at least locally going to be

1698
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,160
at minimum two

1699
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,880
that there's the kind of

1700
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,119
uh one mode of

1701
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,720
interacting

1702
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,520
in an educational or training setting

1703
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,640
with a teaching and a taught

1704
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,240
that could still be in an interactionist

1705
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,760
or an instructionist

1706
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
way

1707
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,599
versus the unteaching and the untaught

1708
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,760
so that's

1709
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,359
the the difference between the athlete

1710
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,119
having their form like observed in a

1711
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,359
tight feedback versus when they're on a

1712
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,160
social away from that sort of a training

1713
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,440
context

1714
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,040
and so there's like

1715
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,240
an environment or there's a setting

1716
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
where there's some kind of

1717
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,400
stress as fundamental

1718
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,880
and then there's another

1719
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,559
type of environment where the different

1720
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,640
kind of stress is fundamental

1721
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,119
and then um franz it was an awesome

1722
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,240
point

1723
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,400
moving from that basic homeostatic

1724
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,440
framing

1725
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,599
where stress is usually considered at

1726
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,480
the first derivative or the state so

1727
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,359
it's like

1728
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,760
for a thermo-organism

1729
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,359
thermal stress is going to be when it's

1730
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,880
hot or cold

1731
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,400
and then that's going to be like a bowl

1732
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,640
or it's a v or it's a bathtub or it's

1733
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,200
some other thermal stress curve it's

1734
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,839
about temperature

1735
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,760
moving into the generalized coordinates

1736
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,400
of motion with temperature

1737
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,960
and change of temperature and change of

1738
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,240
change in temperatures all the higher

1739
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,240
derivatives of temperature

1740
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,559
that expands the space a lot because

1741
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,079
maybe it's possible that a temperature

1742
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,400
that you slowly reach like over

1743
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,480
10 years

1744
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,839
is a different amount of stress than

1745
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,680
just jumping there instantly time

1746
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,319
matters and so the rates of change

1747
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,440
captures that time dependence

1748
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,040
in an instance with a snapshot vector

1749
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,599
so that's sort of the formal use of how

1750
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,119
we can

1751
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,119
look beyond just the stress on

1752
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,559
temperature

1753
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,319
and then we introduce the whole

1754
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,839
cognitive stress because he said well

1755
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,119
for the active inference entity

1756
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,160
this is sort of like the first

1757
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,559
resonance and this is the one whose

1758
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,200
violation of integrity results in

1759
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,880
physical death

1760
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,960
but then stress

1761
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,280
moves to higher or different

1762
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,480
analogous settings

1763
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,880
and that could be how fast am i learning

1764
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,640
and as pointed out by dave in the chat

1765
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,160
and by dean and others like it really

1766
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,720
matters whether somebody has agency

1767
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,880
or affordances to change it and so my

1768
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,640
closing point there with the voluntary

1769
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,720
involuntary is like

1770
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,799
grad school and stress

1771
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,720
because or any

1772
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,280
research or any educational environment

1773
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,680
but one that many people experience is

1774
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,400
like it can be stressful

1775
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,280
it's also a very often privileged

1776
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,799
setting to be in

1777
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,680
and one is taken care of

1778
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,200
sometimes in a way that even like

1779
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,119
neighbors won't be and so that is

1780
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,680
something that like i

1781
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,000
saw first and second hand

1782
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,760
and just thinking about the stress it's

1783
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,000
like why is it stressful

1784
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,960
to just read a few papers some days

1785
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,480
or something like that

1786
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,079
so just kind of interesting with what is

1787
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,000
voluntary and involuntary

1788
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,359
how we commit ourselves to different

1789
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,359
kinds of stress of what kind it's like

1790
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,039
well i wanted it to be novel but not

1791
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,799
that novel

1792
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,240
and how we actually

1793
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,400
make those action selections

1794
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,000
in uncertain environments

1795
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,880
blue

1796
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,720
so just to add on to the voluntary

1797
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,559
versus involuntary like grad school is

1798
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,839
an entirely voluntary endeavor obviously

1799
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,000
but like high school is not and like i

1800
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,520
dropped out of high school at 16. like

1801
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,799
as soon as i was old enough to drop out

1802
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,559
i was like i'm out like i'm not doing

1803
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,839
this compulsory regimented program like

1804
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,280
sorry

1805
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,960
um no regrets right like i started

1806
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,520
college obviously have a phd like did

1807
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
well but it's the difference versus

1808
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,680
involuntary versus voluntary like when

1809
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,680
it's in when it's compulsory it becomes

1810
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,319
torture like

1811
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,200
i mean

1812
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,078
just my just my two sets

1813
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,079
computational group recently about um

1814
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,079
you know the the

1815
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,520
this whole idea of like how do you

1816
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,240
quantify any kind of agency and

1817
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,440
uh

1818
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,079
josh bonga in that in that context works

1819
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,599
with us brought up this idea instead of

1820
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,359
talking about agency which is hard to

1821
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,680
quantify you can talk about empowerment

1822
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,520
and in the computational sense

1823
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,119
empowerment is about

1824
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,280
how much do your actions how much can

1825
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,400
your actions influence your sensations

1826
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,799
um again this makes um very very clear

1827
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,000
in an active infant scheme right where

1828
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,920
you have this markov blanket

1829
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,559
um so like to to support example right

1830
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,440
if you

1831
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,119
if you don't there's no actions you can

1832
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,960
take to change it that's

1833
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,319
you know we can think about it as

1834
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,559
natively stressful but we can also we

1835
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,000
can also

1836
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,920
define that fairly clearly in a

1837
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,000
computational sense using something like

1838
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,119
empowerment

1839
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,960
so it's it's uh

1840
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,799
and that again i like that you brought

1841
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,480
this up because this dries home the

1842
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,160
point that a lot of these fundamental

1843
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,680
things you understand about stress and

1844
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,599
human contact anyone that's ever dealt

1845
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,000
with depression or people that suffer

1846
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,520
from depression right knows that it's

1847
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,720
never really about the the the

1848
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,079
objective

1849
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,920
total amount of stress about about how

1850
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,000
it's being perceived by that person and

1851
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,680
i think this empowerment helps a lot

1852
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,119
this definition empowerment helps a lot

1853
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,720
to understand that better how much

1854
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,240
control do you have of that there's

1855
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,760
other things that of course feed into

1856
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,480
that

1857
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,160
but it also makes them fairly clearly

1858
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,079
that the same a lot of the fundamental

1859
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,359
principles

1860
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,760
must hold true and in lower organisms as

1861
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,240
well because these definitions are of

1862
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,319
course you know as soon as you

1863
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,319
prescribe actions of course you can

1864
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,319
argue that there's no real actions and

1865
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,119
and

1866
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,920
cell biology um then that's okay that's

1867
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,440
just then don't want to talk about that

1868
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,000
level but if you do look at

1869
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,400
active states in this other context then

1870
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,599
you do get

1871
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,760
then you can fairly simply in an active

1872
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,280
inference screen but other ones as well

1873
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,000
define empowerment measure empowerment

1874
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,599
over time by looking at how much how

1875
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,119
much how actions actually change the

1876
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,760
sensory states of the of the cell and

1877
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,359
then definitions of stress from that

1878
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,880
point of view all it's become fairly

1879
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,839
fairly

1880
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,319
explicit

1881
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,200
can i ask you a question

1882
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,400
yeah i can ask you a question because

1883
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,079
you mentioned in the when you were with

1884
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,640
us in the point one for a bit there

1885
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,079
and i don't know if you re-mentioned it

1886
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,599
today he said

1887
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,720
you went to

1888
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,880
mark i think and you said i want to do

1889
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,720
something cool

1890
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,000
we're going to bring this back to the

1891
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,240
voluntary and involuntary piece and then

1892
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,559
he and then you i think you said i think

1893
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,799
you said i'd never heard of active

1894
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,799
inference before

1895
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,280
i was pointed in that direction

1896
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,559
carl's lab

1897
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,240
so

1898
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,920
in the in the in the

1899
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,520
context of what's voluntary and

1900
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,160
involuntary when you when you

1901
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,520
when you said i want to do something

1902
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,119
cool that sounds like you wanted to do

1903
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,880
something voluntarily

1904
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
then you got then you got this deep dive

1905
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,240
into acting

1906
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,480
you push that up against your biology

1907
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,079
background which is something that

1908
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,680
you've obviously done

1909
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,839
because you like it right and you wanted

1910
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,520
to finish off so

1911
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,400
so going forward now

1912
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,520
that

1913
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
that voluntary piece that got you into

1914
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,520
the active inference what do you see the

1915
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,079
active inference doing in terms of this

1916
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,920
empowerment question

1917
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,280
because daniel's written it out here

1918
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,280
with a question mark behind it so how do

1919
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,400
you feel

1920
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,920
more agent a gentle agential

1921
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,520
sorry i always kill words because i'm

1922
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,039
not very

1923
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,200
anyway i'm just curious what you think

1924
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,720
now in terms of what sort of

1925
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,400
empowerments you've

1926
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,720
sort of

1927
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,640
um become

1928
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,640
in the in the sense that now that you've

1929
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,680
got this

1930
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,119
sense of what active inference can do

1931
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,960
and what some of these math formalisms

1932
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,599
provide and what this statistical

1933
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,280
uh world

1934
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,520
bridges yeah what do you what do you

1935
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,720
what do you like what are you thinking

1936
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,480
going forward in terms of the

1937
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,039
reapplication of what you

1938
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,280
what you pulled out of a out of a out of

1939
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,520
a different different bucket and and and

1940
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,039
then it's set down in the bucket that

1941
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,440
you're most familiar with so you mean

1942
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,119
like what where i put that on a personal

1943
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,880
level like for my life decisions yeah

1944
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,000
like when you're when you're going to be

1945
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,520
going forward and trying to and trying

1946
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,839
to use that active inference

1947
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,079
sense yeah in terms of some of those

1948
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,280
decisions

1949
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,720
and what kind of environments do you

1950
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,640
think you see yourself projecting

1951
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,680
yourself

1952
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,359
into that you may not have projected

1953
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,640
yourself into

1954
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,160
prior to

1955
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,839
sort of engaging or encountering or

1956
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,799
exposing yourself to activation yes

1957
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,640
that's a question um

1958
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,440
i think in the end

1959
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,240
it's uh my wife and i we both love this

1960
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,359
world where it's

1961
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,440
serendipity and we're just excited about

1962
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,599
happy accidents which there's all kinds

1963
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,040
of connotations there but an active

1964
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,399
infant scheme

1965
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,238
or any any you know when you look at you

1966
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,839
know what what is information for from

1967
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:22,640
you

1968
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,120
what the idea is that you

1969
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,040
if you have too much if you have so it's

1970
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,799
going really active inference right now

1971
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,719
i'm starting that if you have super high

1972
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,359
precision very strong prior beliefs

1973
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,198
then whatever you if you are confining

1974
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,238
yourself and you don't allow variances

1975
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,799
um to change your mind then then you're

1976
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:43,359
almost always going to be upset because

1977
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,120
you never you know your position is set

1978
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,960
too high right this is

1979
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,479
there's a paper going to be coming out

1980
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,880
soon about this collaborator as well

1981
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,158
looks the right precision in this

1982
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,439
context as well

1983
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,640
so that's something that you know any

1984
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,080
active inference model will know that

1985
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,439
you have to you know

1986
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,880
keep that in mind

1987
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,479
your precisions

1988
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,560
for me personally um

1989
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,960
it it really is an idea of like i think

1990
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,439
every interest this is not not novel

1991
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,279
idea by myself but i need to stretch but

1992
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,960
any any human

1993
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,560
tells stories about the environment but

1994
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,238
most about themselves and the

1995
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,319
storytelling is in my sense nothing else

1996
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,238
than doing a model an active influence

1997
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,839
scheme making a generative model and

1998
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,120
setting that so

1999
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,198
i think too for me to

2000
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,799
i'm way too young to be giving life

2001
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,479
advice but

2002
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,799
for me to to to achieve any kind of

2003
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,399
happiness you have to really be careful

2004
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,520
of uh

2005
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,759
what story you tell about yourself and

2006
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:34,560
how

2007
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,040
strictly you can find that on things and

2008
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,279
that is definitely advantage yourself

2009
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,198
i think personally i've always had

2010
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:43,839
better luck personally i think by by not

2011
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,679
not letting not define that too too

2012
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,679
strictly and really looking into what

2013
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,158
what your environment throws at you and

2014
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,839
i think that helps and i i know

2015
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,600
personally people that have a very hard

2016
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,800
time with that

2017
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,880
and that have very strong model stuff

2018
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,960
you know i'm gonna you know get married

2019
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,800
at that age and then do this and that

2020
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,320
and then when things don't happen that

2021
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,920
way

2022
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,679
i think it at least it's a lot of

2023
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,199
unhappiness

2024
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,640
so if

2025
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,600
you know

2026
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,040
in that context active influence what

2027
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,640
can i do for you i mean

2028
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,840
i think it's it it makes things explicit

2029
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,080
that we all kind of hear about some

2030
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,800
level and and you know i know when you

2031
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,320
confirm psychology but also just you

2032
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,159
know folk psychology things just people

2033
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:25,440
giving you advice

2034
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,280
parents saying i think oh now this is i

2035
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,400
don't want to say that you need i have

2036
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,080
images of any of those insights i think

2037
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,239
you can get this lots of ways but what i

2038
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,080
like about that inference scheme that it

2039
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,760
you know it's it's putting this

2040
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,920
dimension it makes makes the it makes

2041
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,920
the thing also biology the biggest

2042
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,560
advantages you get a very explicit

2043
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,280
uh structure about the information flow

2044
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,199
for very simple systems

2045
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,280
and because it's been

2046
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,679
primarily applied in neurosciences you

2047
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,480
get in for us intuitive results from

2048
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,000
that what happens if you have track

2049
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,440
precision what happens if you probably

2050
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,760
don't change what happens if you know if

2051
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,280
your energy is being minimized all these

2052
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,080
things

2053
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,159
i can fairly easily explain that in the

2054
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,520
context of

2055
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,159
of of human behavior because

2056
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,840
on lesbian's plight we all have to

2057
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,120
understanding

2058
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,760
um but i think there's um

2059
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,280
for the biology point of view there's

2060
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,480
there's a lot of things we can learn

2061
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,920
from that if you look at the fun the

2062
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,760
mathematical definitions

2063
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,040
then of course it deals with the baggage

2064
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,239
that you get from the neuroscience which

2065
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,760
you have to deal a lot with which is

2066
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,880
fair

2067
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,719
um but for your life i think it just

2068
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,040
helps you once you see really how how

2069
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,600
much study has been put into

2070
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,640
miss

2071
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,880
inference you know amount like bad

2072
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,159
inferences

2073
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,640
um and of course people doing tests and

2074
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,600
with

2075
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,920
scheme about you know psychological like

2076
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,679
behavioral task

2077
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,400
states um then i think that that's one

2078
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,440
lesson

2079
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,800
i can definitely learn from that if i

2080
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,080
hadn't already

2081
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,560
is that being be mindful of

2082
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,120
be mindful of your priors be mindful of

2083
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,960
the rate of change like how what are you

2084
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,560
really stressed out about right now

2085
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,719
what's the worst uncertainty coming from

2086
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,000
how much

2087
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,840
should that throw you off right and this

2088
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,640
is

2089
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,000
in a sense

2090
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,440
to kind of bring all this home a little

2091
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,159
bit um the the biggest limitation of of

2092
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,719
any algorithm of any model is that you

2093
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,480
are defining the general model

2094
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,679
beforehand

2095
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,120
not just an active inference scheme but

2096
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,040
any there's papers that come out that

2097
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,320
you know criticize the idea of

2098
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,920
artificial generalized intelligence

2099
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,679
because you always have

2100
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,760
predefined model and life on that sense

2101
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,440
but that definition is

2102
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,360
does not do that like always uh you know

2103
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,440
biological systems evolution kind of

2104
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,719
generates a bunch of diversity

2105
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,960
in its background and from that

2106
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,560
kind of um they pick the best path

2107
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,719
constantly evolve the generative model

2108
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,560
so you know that's kind of like

2109
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,199
limitation of active any other algorithm

2110
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,880
which can be overcome by you know chain

2111
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,800
different uh objects together by

2112
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,719
evolving system but having models make

2113
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,400
models there's some cool work on that

2114
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,080
too but that's something you need to

2115
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,600
take i think

2116
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,520
both computationally scientifically but

2117
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,000
personally take a mind off like at what

2118
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,280
point you change your own model and

2119
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,960
allow for flexibility that's what makes

2120
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,159
human right now

2121
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,760
still that's one of the soft acts that

2122
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,600
makes humans superior i would say into

2123
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,480
any

2124
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,280
um

2125
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,600
to any kind of algorithm right now

2126
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,520
it's because they all come predefined

2127
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,440
with life the heart molecule which again

2128
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,440
it's i don't really actually i'm saying

2129
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,800
this now and also don't actually agree

2130
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,840
with that 100

2131
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,280
i don't actually believe in fundamental

2132
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,719
differences between different

2133
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,040
intelligences but that's something that

2134
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,360
at least uh kind of intuitively makes

2135
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,719
sense to us whether or not that's really

2136
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,280
true scientifically i have my my points

2137
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,120
that but that's going off off the rails

2138
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,360
awesome wow

2139
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,880
a few

2140
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,320
things like we often talk about

2141
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,040
concordances with different systems

2142
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,560
and it brings the cognitive apparatus

2143
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,239
that was developed for

2144
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,679
humans

2145
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,080
and starts to

2146
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,560
at least instrumentally if not

2147
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,600
from a realism perspective also project

2148
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,560
that

2149
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,120
and so it allows um as a trans

2150
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,880
discipline

2151
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,080
people to

2152
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,600
talk about

2153
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,320
systems and map their analogies and

2154
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,520
models

2155
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,080
in a way that would help us find the

2156
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,000
resonances between

2157
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,560
cellular metabolism and economics kind

2158
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
of taking a vague feeling like those

2159
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,800
might have some similarities

2160
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,679
into using the same notation terms forms

2161
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,840
etc so that's one very interesting piece

2162
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,600
about active inference and also the

2163
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,960
limitations

2164
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,199
in terms of at what order

2165
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,120
and how much

2166
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,760
time and attention is allocated to this

2167
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,920
structural aspect

2168
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,679
and how many different families of

2169
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,320
structures are provided

2170
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,980
on one and then to your um

2171
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,840
[Music]

2172
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,320
well-communicated uncertainty about if

2173
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,440
and how

2174
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,600
biology is different from other

2175
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,840
kinds of

2176
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,780
processes

2177
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,320
[Music]

2178
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,920
that's an awesome

2179
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,480
question especially connecting back to

2180
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,960
your point about the reservoir of energy

2181
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,800
versus how locally there can be a

2182
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,679
different energy or entropy balance

2183
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,960
so

2184
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,320
it's almost like

2185
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,880
there might be

2186
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,400
little pieces

2187
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,560
that can be mapped

2188
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,600
to digital signal processing with super

2189
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,199
high fidelity

2190
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,040
and that'll be taken as like a win for

2191
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,480
the realists

2192
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,760
and then there might be other parts

2193
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,400
where the instrumentalism

2194
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,600
bridges

2195
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,159
because we're just making a model of

2196
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,360
this one

2197
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,000
smaller thing and this one larger thing

2198
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and then in cases where this is fully

2199
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,080
computationally defined

2200
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,960
or fully described then there's like a

2201
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
case

2202
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,560
for a real what does empowerment look

2203
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,480
like at

2204
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,760
maybe like a low organismal level or

2205
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,239
even like a cellular level how um

2206
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,239
like is cellular behavior

2207
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,239
or lower organism behavior like

2208
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,560
voluntary versus compulsory and like is

2209
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,320
there a way to measure

2210
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,640
that like obviously like you can trap an

2211
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,120
animal in a box and frequently like you

2212
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,320
know we'll frantically try to get out

2213
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,199
but

2214
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,560
if you don't try it would it go into the

2215
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,560
box and hang out there like like does

2216
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,960
that happen maybe i don't know does

2217
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,040
anybody know of any examples of like

2218
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,840
what um empowerment looks like at like

2219
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,120
that's just it's a super interesting

2220
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,920
concept to me

2221
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,360
um in the in the settings it's if you

2222
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,520
take that definition off um either

2223
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,239
conditional parts your actions change

2224
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,640
your sensory personal perceptions

2225
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,280
then and definitely yeah

2226
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,560
definitely you i would i will it's if

2227
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,159
once you have a definition it's of

2228
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,320
course built on what your diff

2229
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,040
actions are and that that is fairly easy

2230
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,480
and because you don't have to go into

2231
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,400
this route

2232
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,480
whether it's a volunteer or not you just

2233
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,520
base

2234
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,360
something internal state you're

2235
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,960
basically just even even limper you look

2236
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,440
at the the flow of states your markup

2237
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,520
blanket which you can show forms

2238
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,520
naturally which car is shown

2239
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,880
then from that point of view once you

2240
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,960
have active states then you can measure

2241
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,080
that fairly fairly easily so

2242
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,000
as an example i would argue if you know

2243
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,679
if cells actually

2244
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,440
interact with each other and really

2245
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,679
change other cell types we have here's a

2246
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:34,640
great example

2247
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,600
genesis is traditionally

2248
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,440
not yeah i think it's pretty fairly

2249
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,520
established it's really driven by life's

2250
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,440
organizings and it's always a subsequent

2251
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,679
of cells that will drive this cell the

2252
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,679
ones i would argue then that those cells

2253
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,199
are probably very much empowered because

2254
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,000
their actions uh cause differentiation

2255
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,560
of cells around them which then will

2256
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,840
very much and they're going to do a

2257
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,719
certain expression of

2258
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,199
well so then that will they actually

2259
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,040
very much control that whereas those

2260
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
themselves um yeah they're receiving and

2261
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,199
have a lower power because

2262
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,800
their

2263
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,480
their own signaling probably isn't

2264
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,880
really because they're not not

2265
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,400
they often just don't have that that

2266
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,239
they don't make a lot of that signaling

2267
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,520
celta that

2268
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,760
it's being organized in ireland so they

2269
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,520
are not going to have a low end

2270
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,480
let's think of that

2271
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,840
you're asking me what anyone yeah what

2272
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,600
as as our guest or anyone else is

2273
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,080
welcome to

2274
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,960
where there to go i i pressed some light

2275
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,400
to get to

2276
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,280
where the thumbs more than kind of uh

2277
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,640
qualitative like to make making actual

2278
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,320
like instead of just like making these

2279
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,120
abstract models of of active inference

2280
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,880
uh you know we can measure another hand

2281
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,320
if you can really map those two together

2282
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,080
right like in the sense that i mean a

2283
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,000
lot of work went into this whole spm

2284
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,400
software that they developed and uh in

2285
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,159
london and at this point right you

2286
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,080
actually can get fmri data and then you

2287
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,760
can do dynamic calls and model and you

2288
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,880
can really

2289
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,880
you can really postulate different

2290
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,440
causal models and then do a you know a

2291
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,600
bayesian belief updating you can do a

2292
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,840
hypothesis testing right in this in the

2293
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,400
sense that which hypothesis is more

2294
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,360
probable to have cost

2295
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,560
that you see

2296
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,920
um if we get to that level on a

2297
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,679
morphogens for example you can get the

2298
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,239
high fidelity images of the developing

2299
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,080
embryo that you would get

2300
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,080
with over time get signals that you can

2301
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,520
measure and feed back into your model

2302
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,560
and really

2303
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,280
make you detect the past

2304
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,360
of what cause a model like what

2305
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,560
structure would have caused these

2306
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,640
sensations that you or the the data that

2307
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,480
you're receiving that would be a huge

2308
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,960
step forward and uh microscopy is really

2309
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,120
doing some uh having some great advance

2310
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,120
on that one example i can give us a

2311
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,640
friend of mine works on that dimitri

2312
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,239
crum and

2313
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,239
he's been heidelberg and he would this

2314
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,840
light sheet microscopes there's a lot of

2315
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,600
other groups i mean he's a master

2316
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,280
student phd student

2317
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,120
um i bought all that from him but

2318
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,120
there's groups um you can

2319
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,800
do a high fidelity um light sheet from

2320
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
two sides we can really nice like near

2321
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,520
confocal resolution um but with high

2322
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,360
high temporal resolution

2323
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,840
um of their organism doing

2324
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,159
and recapture the entire process of of

2325
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,120
you know from castillation further on

2326
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,320
last

2327
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,440
that you could collect where you can

2328
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,360
read and start to make

2329
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,360
plastic causing molds in an active

2330
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,719
inference framework and then they

2331
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,440
basically request whereas the art

2332
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,960
poem there

2333
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,040
and you can really test and uh this this

2334
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,719
the idea that we already have as

2335
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,520
incentives i mentioned in morphogenesis

2336
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,840
and we test out how much that that fits

2337
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,840
into our notions of of com

2338
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,719
no uh delete updating and actions

2339
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,080
um that would i would love to see that

2340
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,719
in my lifetime

2341
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,840
wow

2342
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,719
super awesome so just to kind of restate

2343
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:01,920
that um

2344
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,600
spm

2345
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,639
has

2346
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,880
been developed in the capacity of

2347
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,280
behavioral neural imaging

2348
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,760
and so it allows a combination of

2349
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,679
observable features

2350
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,679
such as like what button somebody

2351
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,239
pressed or what image somebody was shown

2352
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,000
and also observable features of the

2353
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,239
environment like the measurements coming

2354
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:25,920
in off of the eeg or the fmri or the meg

2355
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,600
and it allows integrated modeling of

2356
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,280
those different kinds of parameters

2357
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,600
along with the dynamical causal modeling

2358
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,760
on the underlying dynamic system

2359
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,080
identification and there's a lot more in

2360
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,639
the spm documentation on that

2361
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:39,920
and so

2362
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,360
active

2363
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,560
here

2364
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,520
along with some advances in for example

2365
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,840
the ability to look at the process of

2366
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,520
embryogenesis and tract cellular

2367
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,320
location for a whole organism developing

2368
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,920
through time

2369
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,040
then that can be fit as if those are the

2370
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,880
fmri measurements

2371
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,920
of this

2372
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,080
embryo spm

2373
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,360
and then the underlying mechanics of

2374
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,719
development

2375
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,560
like a hypothesized morphogen gradient

2376
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,440
or

2377
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,679
a known or hypothesized mechanical

2378
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,440
relationship

2379
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,800
that's part of

2380
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,280
the model that's like the underlying

2381
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,000
neural systems model in spm

2382
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,800
and so it's kind of

2383
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,320
a great

2384
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,840
dream

2385
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,239
but if it can be stated

2386
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,400
if it's likely to exist it sounds like

2387
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,679
you're taking some actions that will

2388
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,120
reduce your surprise about it

2389
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,760
yeah pretty cool

2390
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,960
so

2391
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,000
on the microscopy note i'm like getting

2392
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,080
ready to um

2393
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,000
receive and set up

2394
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,400
a bio afm i'm really looking forward to

2395
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,719
like the multi-parameter

2396
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,440
capability of like i can look structures

2397
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,760
top a lot also like do fluorescence

2398
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,800
imaging so i'm really excited to have

2399
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,040
multiple affordances available on this

2400
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,800
same

2401
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,120
like the mic dances are great like i've

2402
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,040
used an afm and you know it gives you

2403
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,760
the

2404
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,080
mechanics of your sample but

2405
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,920
not not

2406
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,600
it's i've never also been able to look

2407
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,320
at the sample you just the

2408
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,800
mapping without being able to see it so

2409
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,040
i'm really excited to be able to see and

2410
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,679
measure mechanic what's going on in a

2411
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,960
cell but that's

2412
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,880
cytoskeleton um

2413
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,239
parameters

2414
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,400
i was discussing earlier about how that

2415
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,880
you know manipulates or enables cells to

2416
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,600
do different things

2417
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,520
cool

2418
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,040
let's look at any other

2419
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,400
things um or

2420
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,320
also we can sort of give a

2421
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,120
closing round whatever people feel like

2422
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,159
so one one thing i'd like to find

2423
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,600
the fight it's really about um the

2424
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,440
aberrant signaling figure so i don't

2425
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,000
think we went into figure five very much

2426
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,920
last time in the dot one

2427
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,120
and maybe

2428
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,480
uh you could talk about the aberrant's

2429
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,719
selling rescue kind of unpack that for

2430
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,080
us in your own words we're not seeing

2431
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,600
the slides anymore also daniel i don't

2432
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,960
know if you know that

2433
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,440
well i'm not yeah it's also kind of

2434
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,320
lagged on youtube so i'm recording it

2435
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,239
i'll re-upload like the high quality one

2436
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,600
it's kind of like weird it's a normal

2437
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,639
video chat but the youtube stream link

2438
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,560
is like disrupted but say lovey

2439
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,600
um yeah so

2440
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,800
actually if you don't see the

2441
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,159
i'm showing figure five even though you

2442
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,159
can't see it so just

2443
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,480
oh yeah or i see okay

2444
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,840
we can do that

2445
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,520
yes great thank you

2446
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,840
awesome yes for the

2447
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,719
voice

2448
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,719
so this is the the top row here's the

2449
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,480
normal simulation this reference right

2450
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,080
you start off with these eight cells in

2451
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,000
the beginning and then kind of have you

2452
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,280
know this vague

2453
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,480
uh they're very specified very low prior

2454
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,159
belief of what type they are as they

2455
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,920
kind of move out that

2456
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,320
density changes so the the hue tone here

2457
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
makes them means that they're now more

2458
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,320
the more better they are the more sure

2459
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,600
they are being this head type type cell

2460
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,800
um

2461
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,360
or in case of the green that the t

2462
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,520
and b where i base

2463
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,639
one

2464
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,320
one cell which you can see kind of

2465
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,760
heating off and the error points towards

2466
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,000
that had a reduced

2467
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,440
sensitivity

2468
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,480
to

2469
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,639
um two six

2470
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,239
basically

2471
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,159
had a really hard time

2472
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,000
basically um first of all you know it

2473
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,239
was much more it was longer kind of

2474
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,120
unspecified than its neighbor balls were

2475
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,440
and in the end it achieves actually it

2476
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,520
gets wrong cell typewriters

2477
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,199
not only is it a wrong position like

2478
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,560
there's no cell

2479
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,719
in the original one at that play

2480
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,880
and even were you expected to be either

2481
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,800
yellow or red or somewhere in between

2482
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,679
but not blue as it is down here

2483
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,600
so um

2484
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,560
in the sense the intention of of a cell

2485
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,400
of the cancer

2486
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,360
is

2487
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,719
i turn this that way because i think

2488
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,000
that's basically the first step in

2489
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,360
concentration is a

2490
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,320
misidentification of your environment

2491
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,960
and your your place in it all right the

2492
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,400
original paper from carlos called

2493
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,159
knowing knowing one's place the cell

2494
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,400
definitely does not know its place so

2495
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,840
this is what goes in and then here is

2496
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,400
where you have basically um the same as

2497
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,760
above but

2498
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,600
the overall

2499
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,840
not just the absolute flow of actually

2500
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,000
signaling it's like two one cells is to

2501
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,800
get to that has been up regulated so

2502
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,440
that each cell basin now drives more

2503
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,080
concentrations of cells to that cell and

2504
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,080
basically kind of tries the ideas to

2505
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,080
compensate for that

2506
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,840
the healthy

2507
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,120
and what happened

2508
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,040
which i didn't expect at all

2509
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,199
is that you have

2510
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,600
um if you're circulating with it more

2511
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,760
here so you don't see that so much yet

2512
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
you see the cell that kind of initially

2513
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,360
would have normally gone gone down

2514
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,960
small cell

2515
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,159
actually pushed

2516
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,920
out in the end

2517
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,840
yeah what happened

2518
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,800
the words is that those were put into

2519
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,400
most

2520
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,920
io off

2521
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,679
of

2522
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:38,000
of signaling concentration

2523
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,920
and loud arrangement

2524
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,400
allowed this

2525
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,159
cell to re-take a place that um

2526
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,000
is confirmed what you say in the type of

2527
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,360
mythology

2528
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,360
and what i also like to i

2529
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,960
always wait when i when i talk about

2530
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,760
this figure and um both figures really

2531
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,040
is

2532
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,040
you did not in the simulation at any

2533
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,040
point in time change topic morphology

2534
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,880
all the actual encoding was exactly the

2535
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,679
same

2536
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,199
so what they're expecting where they're

2537
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,280
expecting is exactly the same

2538
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,760
and that i think is where i see the

2539
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,560
fundamental

2540
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,719
to change the code right we we know that

2541
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,280
we have higher highest we haven't met

2542
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,719
now energy and fire we ever had and yet

2543
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,960
i think anyone really thinks that this

2544
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,080
is

2545
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,840
the way

2546
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,000
forward in all cases and an only you

2547
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,920
know if if you can do it and you really

2548
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,199
come to understanding that's great and

2549
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,880
you have no other options in an extreme

2550
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,800
case that is absolutely unwarranted i'm

2551
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,520
not trying to dissuade anyone anyone

2552
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
from advances in gene therapy

2553
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,679
but i think it's we you know there's the

2554
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,360
genome is so complex so many things that

2555
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,800
can go wrong we don't know all of the

2556
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,000
details

2557
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,080
that if you did not have to start

2558
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,320
messing up people loading

2559
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,000
that would be preferred and i think this

2560
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,600
is all and also

2561
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,600
from uh even just from a capability

2562
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,719
setting you know that you don't always

2563
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,000
have the capability not with high

2564
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
fidelity that you that we think often do

2565
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,040
so with our lab as well i

2566
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,320
kind of take at the core of my

2567
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,480
experimental approach to things is that

2568
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,440
i want to understand how how cells

2569
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,440
interact with their environment

2570
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,719
and organs

2571
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,480
and work on that manipulation basically

2572
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,440
control information and sensing and

2573
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,120
drive them towards different states

2574
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,360
again with that arlington

2575
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,480
and scale

2576
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,920
that we talked last time about you want

2577
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,520
to direct the floor do actually this

2578
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,800
time have

2579
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,239
i took my shirt i don't even see that

2580
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,880
right now i do have to want landscape

2581
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,600
there on my shirt

2582
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,120
this time

2583
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,360
um so that's kind of like what

2584
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,280
because you're trying to redirect the

2585
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,440
flow of telephate um decision making not

2586
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,920
try to manipulate the actual ambassadors

2587
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,320
themselves

2588
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,920
so what was the

2589
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,679
verb signal

2590
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,560
response oh sorry

2591
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,639
oh god blue there yeah the preserved

2592
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,080
signal response so what was what was

2593
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:06,800
that

2594
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,840
yeah what was how did you perturb the

2595
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,080
like did you cut it off did it get less

2596
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,920
information or did it like

2597
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,159
was it supposed to like infer an

2598
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,239
incorrect place like how exactly in that

2599
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,400
one cell did you manipulate the

2600
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,159
parameters of that one cell so that it

2601
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,679
went to a different place

2602
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,080
yeah basically um

2603
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,040
let me see i think

2604
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,719
uh it was basically done on the

2605
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,280
and uh

2606
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,560
it was a

2607
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,239
decrease in sensitivity is that what it

2608
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,760
was i'm trying to make the specific

2609
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,199
vision right now instead of hand waving

2610
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,440
the

2611
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,880
so let's see in the beginning that we

2612
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,159
also formerly injuries right so that

2613
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,960
that's basically the the how how much of

2614
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,000
a

2615
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,199
right this the

2616
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,159
how much actions are being updated based

2617
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,159
on sensory inputs

2618
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,600
um

2619
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,040
and we can we can put a gradient on

2620
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,639
there and decide on that of how much

2621
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,280
they act on that that is the part and

2622
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,880
that i manipulate here so but that

2623
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,960
basically means is that

2624
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,239
by

2625
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:21,120
altering the response capability of the

2626
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,080
cell how much how much sensory update up

2627
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,159
how many how much

2628
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,840
to what extent

2629
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,000
solutions are being updated based on

2630
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,159
external information flow

2631
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,920
and with what kind of uh you know power

2632
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,280
on top of that

2633
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,920
that by that you're basically upping or

2634
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,600
reducing the sensitivity to the

2635
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,280
environment you basically

2636
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,440
you misarrange you misregulating the

2637
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,280
again the compound essentially but

2638
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,719
that's that's downstream but you know

2639
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,639
you might be the potential of the cell

2640
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,800
to act as environments and do anything

2641
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,880
about

2642
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,679
and also even upstream how much sensing

2643
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,159
of that so in this case specifically it

2644
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:01,920
just wasn't really sensing as much of

2645
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,080
its environment as it was supposed to be

2646
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,080
since

2647
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,239
um it almost

2648
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,320
is equivalent to

2649
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,559
uh

2650
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,440
the argument or the dissolution of sort

2651
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,000
of nature and nurture partitioning by

2652
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,159
just taking a complexity stance kind of

2653
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,639
like evelyn fox keller in her book the

2654
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,159
mirage of a space between nature and

2655
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,000
nurture

2656
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,280
you were talking about a target

2657
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,239
morphology but then about how changes in

2658
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,920
the signal were about to

2659
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,520
do number 40

2660
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,880
on the quantum fep paper

2661
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,600
and blue and our friend jason and i have

2662
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,440
been preparing a lot for it and i think

2663
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,239
separating quantum from

2664
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,639
the electrons and their behavior

2665
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,639
and just asking well what is quantum

2666
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:57,920
strategy

2667
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,639
or what does this quantum statistics or

2668
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,480
quantum information

2669
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,960
projected onto biology mean

2670
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,719
not how it's been approached from the

2671
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,120
mechanistic question which is quantum

2672
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,880
biology well that's about the synapses

2673
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,400
and their quantum

2674
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,159
mechanical properties

2675
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:14,960
or

2676
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,080
about

2677
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:18,159
photon tunneling or proton tunneling and

2678
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,239
like quantum effects

2679
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,159
but what about just using the statistics

2680
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,719
instrumentally of quantum

2681
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,239
and talking about situations with with

2682
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,719
complex patterns of uncertainty

2683
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,960
and observation bias and memory and

2684
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,199
modeling and all of that

2685
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,080
and this was like a dot two that kind of

2686
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,840
like

2687
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,159
opened up a whole new area for us in our

2688
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:43,760
discussions with morphology and like the

2689
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,679
spatial and the embedded

2690
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,800
and and then cracked a window

2691
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
into just

2692
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,040
another area we'll go into

2693
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,280
and you brought so many awesome

2694
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,960
insights so we really appreciate it

2695
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,560
yeah that talk should be a real pleasure

2696
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,400
i highly recommend

2697
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,440
tuning in

2698
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,960
chris fields is great too to listen to

2699
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,880
and it's uh some exciting work and um if

2700
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,040
you also if you have seen i'm sure you

2701
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,440
have seen that um the the particular

2702
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,880
paper from carl fristman he has a

2703
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,120
section there on quantum mechanics and

2704
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,040
it's uh it's a very cool section because

2705
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,360
he actually um derives i think the

2706
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,679
schrodinger occasion equation from

2707
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,360
from a essentially from actual inference

2708
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,199
point of view um from just a definition

2709
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,760
of what your log probability density is

2710
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,880
um very cool kind of uh you know and i

2711
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,120
don't know how much um that will fit

2712
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,600
into other and future work but the

2713
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,520
it's it's always very exciting to me

2714
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,840
when you see different fields at least

2715
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,360
formally being able to be related to

2716
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,199
each other um that usually means that

2717
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,960
something something going on i thought

2718
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,239
it's something fundamental

2719
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,880
we'll have more to say

2720
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,239
in dot 4

2721
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,920
so and join us

2722
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,440
yeah and of course you're welcome any

2723
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,559
time to participate

2724
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,280
yeah carl and i think mike i think

2725
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,719
everybody is coming so if you want to

2726
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,159
come and sure

2727
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,400
join the panel you're more than pleasant

2728
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,119
all right to the events and pop in if it

2729
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,239
works so

2730
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,199
thanks again everybody um hope that the

2731
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,320
viewers can

2732
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,440
bear with a lag if it was there but um

2733
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,360
so peace out everyone thanks a lot for

2734
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,280
this great discussion

2735
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,280
thanks for having me bye

2736
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,280
bye

2737
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,480
you
