17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,799
we're here in active stream number 39.1

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
and we are learning and discussing this

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,000
paper

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,560
morphogenesis as bayesian inference a

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
variational approach to pattern

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
formation and control in complex

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
biological systems by coochling fristen

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
georgiev and levin from 2020

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
and we had a

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,240
fun

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,119
dot zero and time probably all

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
individually going through the paper

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
pretty much in

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
thirty nine one we'll just kind of go

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
over introductions and then can go to

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
a blank

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
page and just see where especially

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
stephen

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
and blue want to raise any questions and

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
also anyone can ask in the live chat

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
okay so

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
we'll just do introduction so i'm daniel

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
i'm a researcher in california and i'll

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
pass it to liv

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
and i will pass it to stephen

43
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,000
hello i'm stephen sillett i'm based in

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
toronto i'm a sort of a

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
action researcher and practitioner in

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
community development and participatory

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,238
theater and i will pass it to dean

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
good morning i'm dean i'm here in

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
calgary um

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
and not much to say other than i'm kind

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
of looking forward to hearing what uh

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,879
what blue and steven have to add to this

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,160
uh

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,879
this rather uh

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
big math question and how that fits with

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,040
morphology so

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
back to you dan

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,720
okay

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
um

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
well

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
if anyone wants to start with

62
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
a specific

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,319
question or figure or we can review

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,680
just sort of the

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
main points of the paper like let's look

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
at the roadmap

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
so

68
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
what section would people like to enter

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,079
in or have a question or idea related to

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,720
or we can just go yeah dean

71
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,920
so

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
you wanted to talk about this and i

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
wanted to talk about this and

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
it was it was this whole section on the

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
least action principle which i think we

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
both find quite

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
interesting because

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,959
yeah

79
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,920
why

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
um

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,319
and

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,120
it led me to the question of is there is

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,159
there something efficient about search

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,519
over

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
somebody sort of passing along and

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
sharing so i'm kind of curious what

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
people

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
think of that in terms of the math and

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,640
the morphology

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
all right least action

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
math

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
morphology

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
stephen

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
yeah i i don't know if we could unpack a

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,640
little bit more what dean was saying

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
there i'm i'm interested in

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
some of the implications of that um

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
work around looking at the math and

99
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,239
morphology

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
as it scales from these

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,720
what you might call smaller

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
scales than we can normally perceive

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
often what's going on with morphogenesis

104
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,519
is not

105
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
something we can be consciously aware of

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
a lot of the time however

107
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,199
who we are is built upon

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,120
morphogenesis

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,240
so i'm i'm very curious around

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
how some of these first principles can

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
be thought of as rolling out so when we

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
talk about lease action

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
has been one way of approaching it where

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
people often think about

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,240
um

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
energy

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,039
and efficiency of energy

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
processes as being the route that

119
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,440
everything will take

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
the more informational bayesian

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
inference

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
approaches and learning that

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
is implied by this

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
without

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
sort of distracting from the paper i'm

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,759
curious about people's thoughts about

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
what sort of

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,479
uh

129
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
implications that has for thinking about

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
these bottom-up

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,880
ways of knowing

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
okay blue

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
so i have

134
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
some questions going back even to before

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
least action in the paper

136
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,520
talking about generalized flow

137
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,639
and it's really interesting um just in

138
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
light of the paper that's coming up

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
in number 40

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,919
but but here um you know we see that

141
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
this is like a spatial like we're

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
talking about spatial motion here or

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
like the foundation for the way that

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
they model morphogenesis is

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
you know positions of particles through

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,240
space right like and time

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
and i just i just wonder um

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,840
like we have a time evolution

149
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
here and we're talking about motion in

150
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
space

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
but

152
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
could we do the reverse and talk about

153
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
like a space evolution in terms of

154
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
time like

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,520
it in terms of like can we invert space

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
and time

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
um

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
here so that's just it's something that

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,639
i was

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
curious about if it's

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
possible or mathematically illegal or

162
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
why am i even thinking like that i don't

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
know um

164
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
and another question that i had um

165
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,800
you guys were we're really talking about

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,759
um

167
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,639
you know the the in the generalized flow

168
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
we talked about the equations of motions

169
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
coordinates of motion

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
and the derivatives

171
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
uh and something that i saw in the paper

172
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
specifically at equation 15

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
that i've not seen before is p with a

174
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
dot and it was not defined in the paper

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,680
p with a dot but i'm assuming it's the

176
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,960
first derivative of p and i just thought

177
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
um that that was

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
interesting

179
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,479
so it's the probability density but is

180
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,160
it the derivative of the probability

181
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
density with respect to x with the tilde

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
or is it just p dot because x has a

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,799
tilde

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
anyway

185
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,479
that's my my question there

186
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
all right wow well we have a lot kind of

187
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
uh on

188
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,318
the table

189
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,080
i think the thing blue

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,639
appended with generalized flow is a good

191
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
entry point because this is sort of what

192
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
the

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
system's state evolution is and in

194
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,560
live stream number 26 with bayesian

195
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
mechanics we also talked about the

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
generalized coordinates of motion

197
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,199
with relationship with control

198
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
so

199
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
it's kind of like a thermometer

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
cybernetic model

201
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
if you only have the position of the

202
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
temperature there's certain strategies

203
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
that can be applied given that

204
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
modeling just simply the temperature

205
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
and then if you are modeling

206
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,399
progressively higher and higher levels

207
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,839
of how the system changes it's kind of

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
like a taylor series it equates to

209
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
basically a better depth of control

210
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
and then part of the hard part is that

211
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
because over the time course that action

212
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
is being planned for

213
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
even hypothetically

214
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
changes in

215
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
like the unknown consequences of one's

216
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
action complicate the estimation of

217
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
different policies

218
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
so this is just not like a total

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
perfect way to roll out the system and

220
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
understand how it's going to happen but

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
it gives like approximation terms to

222
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
higher and higher levels of the system

223
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
changing

224
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,160
and so that's the um

225
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
and all of the levels of analysis are

226
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,480
being linked to each other by being

227
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,720
derivatives of each other so then some

228
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
stationarity like is

229
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,320
capped out at some point so the

230
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
derivative becomes zero and then that's

231
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
like a heuristically

232
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
approximatable

233
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,519
um

234
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
depth of that model

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
so that's just like one note

236
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
of what is being estimated on so it's

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
like temperature and its higher order

238
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
components

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
in some

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
either analytical kind of

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
infinite generalized way

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
or just more practically with some

243
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
smaller realization

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
and then

245
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
the dot is like a derivative pretty sure

246
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
to blue like it's like a prime like

247
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,279
prime prime for double derivative two

248
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
dots for two derivatives

249
00:09:59,519 --> 00:09:59,810
um

250
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,120
[Music]

251
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,839
and then morphogenesis is like position

252
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,720
of

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
particles

254
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
um

255
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
here it's like the cell

256
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
body or the cell nuclei

257
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,079
or the center of gravity of something

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
and then those are spatially moving so

259
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
that's the lowest level of this chain of

260
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
the integrator chain with the

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
generalized coordinates of motion

262
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
so that's how it's from a bayesian

263
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
mechanics

264
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
getting to

265
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
morphogenesis with just how particles

266
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
are moving in space

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
but instead of just modeling like their

268
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,640
x and their y it's like x and y and the

269
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,160
higher level

270
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
derivatives

271
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,360
so that's the developmental

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,839
motion of

273
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,560
particles

274
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
just to summarize that part before

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
the space and time okay any

276
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
thoughts on that because the generalized

277
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
flow is definitely where

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
whatever least action is is going to be

279
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
based in

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
um okay so then

281
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
let's just look at that

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,119
formalism

283
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
here is the derivatives okay anything on

284
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
this yeah yeah yeah yeah so if you're

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
gonna look at the at the formalism um

286
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
did you pull it up here yeah generalized

287
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
there you go um

288
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
so go ahead and then i'll i'll interject

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
yeah here's 2.2.1

290
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
x tilde is the total

291
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,800
blur of all the dots on top

292
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
so yeah go for blue

293
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
so just here the um

294
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
my question more is the noise and

295
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,360
fluctuation

296
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
term

297
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
um and is that just like brownian motion

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
or

299
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
i don't know so

300
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
yeah like what is the where is the omega

301
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,079
random fluctuation

302
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,160
like is it just

303
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
i don't know random in in terms of

304
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,399
browning motion or is there some other

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
random fluctuation positionally

306
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,000
like do things wiggle

307
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
definitely someone who knows more about

308
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
uh

309
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
stochastic processes and

310
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
i know several people listen who do

311
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
um could help with this

312
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
like in a math stream on

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
a little bit of the stochastic aspect

314
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,360
here

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
but i think at a first pass

316
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
um

317
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,440
there's situations where the

318
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
what is modeled as

319
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
noise

320
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
versus what is modeled as signal have

321
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,920
differential ratios

322
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
so there's times where like the

323
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
regression is very

324
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
the f even if the regression another

325
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
function is like very tight and then the

326
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
noise is modeled as low

327
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
versus

328
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
one where just the location of x is just

329
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
dominated by the noise term but

330
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
i'm sure it's way more

331
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
than that too

332
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
um

333
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
stephen or

334
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
dean

335
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,800
well i was just gonna

336
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
you know often when we see i'm just

337
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
thinking broadly in terms of the

338
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
modeling approaches and active inference

339
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,279
often

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
it brings in temperature as a way to

341
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,880
sort of bring in the kind of noise

342
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
fluctuations

343
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
into models whereas here

344
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
it's directly seen as a noise

345
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,600
fluctuation term

346
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
um

347
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
so i think that's uh

348
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,199
maybe it's again because we're going

349
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
down to even more first principles here

350
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,079
that it's getting down to stochastic

351
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
dynamics which isn't necessarily even

352
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
thought of as temperature but something

353
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,480
um

354
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,199
more more foundational

355
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,880
okay

356
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
um yeah blue

357
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
so temperature

358
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
um

359
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,760
is like yeah right like with increasing

360
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
temperature um like

361
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
random motion would increase so that

362
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
does um make sense to me

363
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
so another um

364
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
point out of this section or maybe if

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
anybody else has a point here

366
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,160
um going down into the next like set of

367
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
equations

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,440
unless anybody else yes

369
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,199
yeah just to summarize that it's kind of

370
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
like the temperature parameter is

371
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
understood sometimes to play this role

372
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,519
of

373
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
mediating the difference between the

374
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
particles

375
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,000
motion being driven by

376
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
some sort of directed

377
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
motion

378
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,399
um like change in position through time

379
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,480
not at stationarity of position which is

380
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
like kind of the observable in that

381
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,839
chain

382
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,800
that

383
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
directed motion

384
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
versus thermal slash brownian

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,580
and then um

386
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,199
[Music]

387
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,880
that might be kind of where these

388
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
statistical assumptions come into play

389
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
so it's like variance estimation but

390
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
temperature is just one kind of variance

391
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
with the move the motion

392
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
of particles

393
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
but and it has a it has a physical

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
interpretation in it and i mean it's not

395
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,160
an insignificant

396
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,759
piece i don't know

397
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,120
we could explore more where temperature

398
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
specifically comes into play but stephen

399
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,079
i think you're getting at the right

400
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
thing that this is not temperature bound

401
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
but it does relate to that sort of

402
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,000
situation okay blue

403
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,279
um so i don't know if you want to go

404
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,639
down to equations um 15 and 16 this is

405
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,320
probably where my next

406
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
question or comment is

407
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
do you have them in there or no oh copy

408
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,880
it in right now cool

409
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,560
go for it

410
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,440
so

411
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
it says

412
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
um

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
equation 15

414
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,880
uh

415
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,639
i think that's x tilde dot yes

416
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,360
p x tilde um it is a probability current

417
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,399
which i thought that that was cool

418
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
because i've never really heard of that

419
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,720
like term of probability current like

420
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,839
how

421
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,279
probability changes over time or or um

422
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,560
how

423
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
the probability density changes over

424
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
time like what is a probability current

425
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
like that was just it's an interesting i

426
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,440
don't know

427
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
um

428
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
like term that i hadn't heard before

429
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,279
and then in the second um equation 16

430
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
it says that um this is a partial

431
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
differential equation that describes the

432
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
time evolution of the probability

433
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,680
density under dissipative and

434
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,720
conservative forces so where the term on

435
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
the left is the dissipative forces and

436
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
the term on the right is the

437
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
conservative forces

438
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
and i thought like that that was

439
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
interesting especially relating back to

440
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,720
the dot zero video um

441
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
where you guys were talking about a

442
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
tensor and dean was talking about

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,000
tension and i think that there's is like

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
an interesting

445
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,839
tension here between like conserving and

446
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
dissipating and it just makes me like

447
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,760
wonder how um

448
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
how like

449
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
like is death when like the dissipative

450
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
like term is winning like is that like

451
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
what causes like a system or i mean i

452
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
know that the term you know winning or

453
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,120
term being greater doesn't cause a

454
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
system to die or when a system is

455
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
decomposing

456
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,120
if that can be represented here in terms

457
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
of these dissipative and conservative

458
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
forces um in the process of an organism

459
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,760
dying or ceasing to exist

460
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
okay sorry i have way more questions

461
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
than nice nice let's let's look at 15

462
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
and 16 a little bit so yes probability

463
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
current it's kind of in this dynamical

464
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
systems framing

465
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
it's being

466
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,679
bridged with

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,120
formalisms that are like more like a

468
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
current like a flow

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
on

470
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,679
a dynamical landscape

471
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,919
there's that sort of angle but then

472
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
there um

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
and maybe there's also more of a fluid

474
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,840
flow component blue

475
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
it's a timer

476
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
i was needed so like it's funny when i

477
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
look up a probability current like also

478
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,720
foreshadowing foreshadowing the dot zero

479
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
it says in quantum mechanics the

480
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
probability current sometimes called

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
probability flux is a mathematical

482
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
quantity describing the flow of

483
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
probability

484
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
um so so it's interesting that it's

485
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
related to quantum mechanics and in

486
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
terms of these like

487
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,240
instead of these classical physics um

488
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
things that we've kind of been

489
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,240
looking at or dealing with so far

490
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,400
um yeah so this

491
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
14

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
is

493
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,360
okay this might be a only a partial

494
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,400
element or for example hopefully one

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
that is useful so this is x tilde with a

496
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
dot so that's x tilde all the

497
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,679
coordinates of motion and then

498
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,280
x with a dot means derivative of so this

499
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
left parameter with a tilde and a dot is

500
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
how the generalized coordinates are

501
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
changing through time

502
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
so that's kind of what is being modeled

503
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,400
the data that are being whether they're

504
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
an observable or an unobserved estimated

505
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
state in a bayesian graph so whether

506
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
it's an o or an s

507
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,240
that plus it's all of its derivatives

508
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
and then that is being partitioned into

509
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
one big

510
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,320
complex function

511
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,200
f

512
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
modeling it

513
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
flow

514
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
and then

515
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
this noise omega tilde over both are

516
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
over tilde

517
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
so the these are both over like each of

518
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,679
these higher derivatives also have an

519
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,960
associated noise term

520
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,640
and then it says

521
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
yeah okay stephen

522
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,559
in some ways

523
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,080
there could be an analogy i'm not saying

524
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,159
it's the same but there's a there seems

525
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,919
to be a mirroring of the

526
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,480
enthalpic turn and entropic terms you

527
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
get in gibbs free energy where

528
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
one is where there's

529
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
this the energy is bound within

530
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
the molecules at play

531
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
and then the other term this

532
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
entropic term where it's kind of

533
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
dissipating so

534
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
um

535
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,960
then

536
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,720
it's it's another

537
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
because these things are

538
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
is translatable just like mass and

539
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
energy are translatable and they're

540
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,440
known to ultimately be conserved

541
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,480
um

542
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
they can only be

543
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
the overall

544
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,280
mass energy

545
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,760
of a system is always conserved but it

546
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,600
could be translated between

547
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
normally we don't think about that

548
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
because it only happens in nuclear

549
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
reactions but

550
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,120
if you're thinking informationally it's

551
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
still and this and i see they talk about

552
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
this idea of probability mass

553
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,720
so that there's almost uh

554
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
an ability to think about that

555
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
conservation of um

556
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,960
energy in a form which has mass which

557
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
has form

558
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
as opposed to when things have

559
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
dissipated as light

560
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
where it doesn't have mass anymore

561
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
okay blue

562
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,559
so i think where they're talking about

563
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,120
the conservation of probability

564
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
mass i think that they mean like the

565
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
conservation of the total

566
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
probability

567
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
there like so the probability mass

568
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
function right right like so i think

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
it's that um which which relates to like

570
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
the it's the conservation of mass but

571
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
it's also the conservation of

572
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,400
information

573
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
using that conservation of probability

574
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
like the probability of all of the

575
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
possible things happening has to add up

576
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,880
to 100

577
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
like that probability is never going to

578
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
change

579
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
um and so i think that that

580
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
is there

581
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,120
that it has to add up to one

582
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,760
like a fraction or a hundred percent

583
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
uh has the realist and

584
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
and instrumentalists

585
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,080
take

586
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,159
the realest take is something has to

587
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,120
happen

588
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
and then the instrumentalist take is

589
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
if we model it this way we're going to

590
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
be able to use statistics

591
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,200
but if it was like well the chance of

592
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
getting heads is 60 and the chance of

593
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,440
getting tails is 60

594
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,240
in this next flip

595
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
it would open up the space

596
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
in a different way

597
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
um it it's kind of outside the bounds of

598
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,360
the model you could have a model where

599
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
both happen

600
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
but still there's

601
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
it's a different thing you know can you

602
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
model things that can't happen in the

603
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
real world or

604
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,280
if it's not a good measuring stick for

605
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
statistics which is kind of like that

606
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
one

607
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,159
something must happen we have to model

608
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
something happening we have to model a

609
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
data set row being added otherwise what

610
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
is happening if it were like one

611
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,919
one every one every 1.2 rows

612
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,200
so

613
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
um

614
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
and then here yeah steven

615
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
in relation to the point you just made

616
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
i'm just curious whether if these

617
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,919
functions can be used in multiple

618
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
um particles

619
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
um in say for instance you have the

620
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,799
probe the idea is the probability of a

621
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,039
coin being flipped is 50 50 for instance

622
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,559
or a rigged coin could be 60 40 in one

623
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,440
way

624
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,919
however

625
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,200
the

626
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
probability if there's noise

627
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
on how rigged something is so for

628
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,159
instance you've got you've got a coin

629
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,840
and it's flipping between being rigged

630
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
60 40

631
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
50 50

632
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,080
40 30.

633
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,919
so there's kind of a there's a random

634
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,679
fluctuation in

635
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,679
that behavior which maybe contextually

636
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,200
contingent

637
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,039
that in itself wouldn't be in the one

638
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,320
equation but if you had multiple

639
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,159
particles

640
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,960
there they could start to behave not

641
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,400
just as one

642
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
predictable thing they themselves could

643
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,039
have the change in probability

644
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
approaches

645
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
thanks blue

646
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
so i i think like specifically as

647
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,559
related to here and i think that this is

648
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,640
derived like i'm not i don't like really

649
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,480
know um i don't really do these like

650
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
derivations it's definitely not my area

651
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
of expertise but i think

652
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
in in terms of the conservation of mass

653
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,880
like like we're not creating or

654
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,039
destroying matter

655
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,760
the conservation of the probability mass

656
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,919
it just says that all the particles if

657
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,200
you're looking at it doesn't matter if

658
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
it's one particle or a thousand

659
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,200
particles the particles are

660
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
somewhere

661
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
right like so the particles are not

662
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,960
nowhere like the particles are

663
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,919
somewhere so so it's that kind of

664
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,679
concert that's like the idea that you

665
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
know all the probability has to add up

666
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,159
to one like there is 100 chance that you

667
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,640
will find the particle of interest

668
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
somewhere i mean

669
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,640
you write

670
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,559
okay

671
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:48,920
um

672
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,019
[Music]

673
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
yeah blue good section to uh pull out

674
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
important some important bridge

675
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
equations

676
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,919
so we have the signal to noise now when

677
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,240
the signal that we're modeling

678
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
with the instrumentalist take we're

679
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
modeling how much the cow weighs

680
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
defined as

681
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
the one that

682
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
comes to walk over to me when i call for

683
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
it or something like that

684
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
that could be dominated by

685
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,159
different functions

686
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,720
or could be driven by different noise

687
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
on different time skills

688
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
so the signal

689
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,120
sort of directed motion component or

690
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,799
modelable component

691
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,679
of

692
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,039
the motion through time is the purple

693
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,720
and here is like some

694
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
flow with the upside down triangle

695
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
that we talked a little bit about in dot

696
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,840
zero but would of course be good to hear

697
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
from someone who knows more about this

698
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
flow

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,799
um

700
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,919
operator

701
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,039
object

702
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
um

703
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,520
signal

704
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,159
is like the movement on a probability

705
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,840
distribution

706
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
on those states changing

707
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,799
and then

708
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
the noise

709
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,799
is

710
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,320
the dissipative

711
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,320
component

712
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,158
stephen

713
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,159
it appears as well that by

714
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
breaking it into dissipative and

715
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
conservative

716
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
components it's um

717
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,159
it's serving a similar

718
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
role to separating into complexity and

719
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,559
accuracy

720
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,880
it's given a way to

721
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
um

722
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
break apart

723
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,440
for dissipation um

724
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
where the um

725
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
because you're not actually talking

726
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,279
about a final target

727
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,840
but more like you

728
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
things just doing what they do in some

729
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
ways and having a very

730
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,919
kind of physics

731
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,760
fundamental process

732
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
i think that's proven to be useful

733
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,399
because it's also again

734
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,399
something which can be translated into

735
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,080
different

736
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,480
different types of

737
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,000
math different types of physics

738
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
okay so let's connect it to the

739
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,919
morphogenesis so what do they do in the

740
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,720
paper they're modeling the motion of

741
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
cells so why does it matter this whole

742
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,200
discussion that we're having

743
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,799
about how to get from the motion of

744
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,320
generalized coordinates if you're the

745
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,559
modeler you get to define that and get

746
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
to set the parameter between this

747
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,640
if you're the

748
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
experimentalist then you're inferring

749
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
this kind of like a regression like if

750
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
this was a regression term and a noise

751
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
term on the regression

752
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
that and then there's some function that

753
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
helps you

754
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,960
fit a certain solution

755
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,720
to the one linear regression that fits

756
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,000
it best

757
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,159
so it's like kind of in that same

758
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
genre here

759
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,480
so if we take the realist take

760
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,360
um

761
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,520
on that it's like how the actual system

762
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,159
is defined as or inferred to be as from

763
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,760
experimental data

764
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,399
and then flowing the probability

765
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,880
density on that of our inference on that

766
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
whether we're getting that from the data

767
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
or whether we're

768
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,240
defining that system formally

769
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,960
so

770
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
that modeling

771
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
we get help from the

772
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
authors or someone else like

773
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,600
it engages some new

774
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
future

775
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,240
it's like a bridge to some other set of

776
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,960
equations so

777
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,399
that's where it would be good to learn

778
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,919
more like what is actually enabled here

779
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
but it enables a new

780
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
vista

781
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,600
that separates that that enables this

782
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
separation

783
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
so we can talk about instead of this

784
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
like potentially extremely open-ended

785
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,000
and non-linear change on the system

786
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
can be bounded within a statistical

787
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,200
inference

788
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,080
zero to one

789
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,399
inference framework

790
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,760
that

791
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,360
is more amenable to certain kinds of

792
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
analysis

793
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,159
so

794
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,679
that would help

795
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,000
model cell location and

796
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,039
all of that

797
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,720
but i think there's still a lot more to

798
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,919
learn there and

799
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,120
unpack okay dean yes

800
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,039
so i want to just sort of step back for

801
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,760
a second here because i want to go

802
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,039
we started out

803
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,120
talking about someone what are the

804
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
implications for least action

805
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,399
so the act part and then we

806
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,480
sort of stepped into the idea of what

807
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
what came before the action well it was

808
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,600
these flow states and i kind of want to

809
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,279
go back to the action part in this in

810
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,000
the

811
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
under that section 222 the second

812
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,919
paragraph says that

813
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,919
the least action principle can predict

814
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
the emergence of forms so what daniel

815
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
was mentioning there that sort of the

816
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
morphogenesis

817
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,840
in terms of the flow or paths of least

818
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,000
action in biological systems for example

819
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
in colonies

820
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
ants find the paths of least action to

821
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,679
harvest food and bring it to the colony

822
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,919
the example considers their paths as

823
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
flow channels or trajectories finding

824
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,120
the least average

825
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,200
action for each instance of foraging

826
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,279
given available resources so this gets

827
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,440
me thinking

828
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,679
about what do we mean by

829
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,760
least action as opposed to say most

830
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
action and

831
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
that that that

832
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,840
general way the general way

833
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,039
that things tend to follow like if you

834
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,320
thought of an

835
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,080
analogy of

836
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,279
of uh maybe 18 19th century war where

837
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,559
armies would line up facing one another

838
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,679
uh

839
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
parallel to one another

840
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,919
this is speaking more like a flow state

841
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
more like you find in nature where the

842
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,399
the molecules we talked about here are

843
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,440
sort of flowing and following down the

844
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
side of a bowl to the least potential

845
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,039
energy

846
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,640
and so

847
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,039
now my question is okay so why does

848
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,320
nature

849
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,960
tend to

850
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,039
flow with the advantage of least

851
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,720
action whereas people with

852
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
instruments

853
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,799
don't necessarily

854
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,200
flow or follow one another unless

855
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,760
they're mirroring

856
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,480
some other form or some other shape

857
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
so

858
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,679
it's interesting to me because i think

859
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,039
by nature we are quite adaptable

860
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,880
but when we start making

861
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,120
uh non-living things as instruments to

862
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
necessarily take the nature away the

863
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,519
life away where maybe not as quite as

864
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,279
adaptable so

865
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,720
i'm trying to bring it i'm trying to

866
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
step back and

867
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,679
now pull us back into this idea of so

868
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
what advantage is there

869
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
in this physics

870
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
view of least action there must be

871
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,679
something advantageous there in nature

872
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,960
so what is it i'm not the geneticist so

873
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,279
i don't know what this what the signal

874
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,960
milieu is

875
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
that

876
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,720
makes that so so i want to tap your

877
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,399
guys's

878
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
and gals's

879
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
expertise on this because i don't have

880
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,840
it

881
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,360
all right thanks dean stephen

882
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,120
so following on what dean's saying there

883
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
i think with um

884
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,840
in

885
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,919
the traditional sense we tend to take

886
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
what we call equilibrium dynamic

887
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
approaches so for instance the arm we

888
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,000
the armies are lined up like dean said

889
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
then there's a battle

890
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
and then there's the final state so we

891
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,679
talk about the initial conditions which

892
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,640
is equilibrium everyone lined up and the

893
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,000
final state

894
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,320
and then the bit in the middle

895
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
we sort of talk into our shirt or our

896
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
shoulder or whatever

897
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,919
cough a few times and somehow it

898
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,960
happened

899
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,760
and

900
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,679
in some ways with the biological

901
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,000
approach it's like it's in that

902
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,119
because all that bit in the middle is

903
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,960
where the flow is happening so

904
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,480
essentially speaking

905
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,399
and biology doesn't have those

906
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,839
initial conditions in the sort of

907
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,800
traditional sense of pure equilibrium

908
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,599
it's always in this non-equilibrium

909
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
or at least a large component is in a

910
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,520
non-equilibrium state so this is an

911
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
interesting

912
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,960
thing as it's flowing down towards

913
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,040
the least energy

914
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,599
it never reaches it so we might you know

915
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,918
i think that's uh it always so for

916
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,239
instance in in the chemical reactions

917
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,800
you you set you you take your pure

918
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,159
reactants

919
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
you mix them together

920
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,239
you stir it up you do the reaction and

921
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
then once you've got your product which

922
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,480
could be a precipitate for instance

923
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,918
which you know it could be a ton of the

924
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,800
precipitate it then gets filtered it

925
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
gets washed it gets dried

926
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,359
and it gets measured for how pure it is

927
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
and now it's in this kind of stable

928
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,839
product form you know

929
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,640
um so i think yes

930
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,280
this this this question about

931
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,900
what does it mean to flow

932
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,839
[Music]

933
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,880
um is really important

934
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,400
thanks steven all right dean

935
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,680
well what this what this flowing and

936
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
following thing

937
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,680
kinda says is that

938
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
the the desire line or the or the

939
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,560
termite mound the result

940
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,759
is of signaling

941
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,920
which

942
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,119
which is

943
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,480
i don't know if that's collective

944
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,920
signaling i i don't know if it's the

945
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,160
stigma she part of it like i i don't

946
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
know

947
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
why nature sees the advantage

948
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
in the following

949
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,040
but there has to be something there why

950
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,079
why

951
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,560
why is that advantageous why is that

952
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,119
more adaptable

953
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,240
versus the alternative

954
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,720
okay thanks stephen

955
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
well i suppose one way of looking at

956
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
that is it's the only

957
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,320
cause i mean if we're going to take a

958
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,560
realist route uh recognizing that it

959
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,640
maybe it's the only plausible route on

960
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
the table

961
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,079
um

962
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
we we they don't get to

963
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,040
you know

964
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,560
forge teeth in a kiln or

965
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,880
you know in a way that's partly why all

966
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,839
chemicals that are available in nature

967
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,920
have to be within

968
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
certain plausible

969
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,839
um temperature scales and pressure

970
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,200
scales

971
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,760
that that can yield those react those

972
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
products at

973
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
so

974
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
i mean that kind of doesn't answer the

975
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,480
question exactly because i know that's

976
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
kind of a bit of a

977
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,680
but it's part of it's what's available i

978
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,480
think

979
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
in terms of um biological plausibility

980
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,800
um and i suppose in some ways humans we

981
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,320
we we've adapted a cognition to try and

982
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,839
move outside that

983
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,119
okay yeah dean

984
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,880
now one last thing on this and that is

985
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
that

986
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
following implies that there's also

987
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,680
something leading there always has to be

988
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
something taking that

989
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,200
that initiative for others to

990
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,359
fall in line behind

991
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,440
so

992
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,119
shifting that and making leadership

993
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,119
something that's more lateral

994
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,359
so sort of going forward

995
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,079
together as opposed to

996
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,800
who do who do we decide to

997
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
to

998
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
follow behind that's an interesting

999
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,800
thing in terms of sort of assessing out

1000
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,680
how this least action principles things

1001
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,000
turns into things that we actually

1002
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,359
see phenomenal phenomenologically so

1003
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,359
again we're going to get into the what

1004
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,839
what the final form takes i just think

1005
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,200
that when we were

1006
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
sort of treating this in the point zero

1007
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,079
this was kind of piv a pivotal moment

1008
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,160
because it went from what are all the

1009
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,240
things that have to be in place for

1010
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,040
formation to occur

1011
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,640
to now let's let's look at what the what

1012
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
the form now

1013
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,119
results as and as as i said in here in

1014
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,359
that one paragraph it said

1015
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,759
um

1016
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,839
well the previous paragraph says physics

1017
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
offers a useful formalism to understand

1018
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,839
at a quantitative level the ability of

1019
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,599
biological systems to work towards

1020
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,000
so now we're we're basically now

1021
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,359
moving to something that is that is

1022
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,720
adaptable

1023
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,520
so i think like i said i don't want to

1024
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,800
over

1025
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,640
over talk this one point but i think

1026
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
it's an interesting part in terms

1027
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,480
especially when we get into the the

1028
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,720
discussion at the end

1029
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
around why

1030
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,680
what what some of the assumptions were

1031
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,160
in yada yada

1032
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
okay

1033
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,040
thanks yeah stephen

1034
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,240
this work towards um idea i mean that

1035
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,480
can be

1036
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,960
thought of in a as a modeling and a life

1037
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,520
realist problem like how how does that

1038
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
work towards

1039
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
uh and

1040
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,160
in some ways

1041
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,480
accuracy and complexity

1042
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,720
can

1043
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
be used once we

1044
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,040
if we're at the level of assuming that

1045
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,440
we are actively inferring to stay alive

1046
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
but

1047
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,680
prior to that

1048
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
something like

1049
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
conservation and dissipation

1050
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
or conserved

1051
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,119
are

1052
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,400
a bit more foundational okay because

1053
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,520
if

1054
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,359
by

1055
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,000
conserving or working within this

1056
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,119
conserving dissipating noise

1057
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,960
dynamic

1058
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
at the levels which are below what we

1059
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,560
are consciously aware of however which

1060
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,040
all our cognition is effectively built

1061
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,880
upon somewhere

1062
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
we

1063
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
we're able to

1064
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,760
potentially

1065
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,480
give that towards us

1066
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,680
without necessarily having set a goal

1067
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,160
and it could be and i think that's

1068
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,359
um

1069
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,359
that might be an interesting see how

1070
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,680
that rubs out in the real

1071
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,599
real world

1072
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,400
of of active influence labs and papers

1073
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,359
and stuff

1074
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,880
um

1075
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,800
yeah

1076
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,079
cool

1077
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,800
yeah a lot you link there stephen just

1078
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,000
now like accuracy complexity

1079
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,359
and then okay

1080
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,440
we'll leave it for a future

1081
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,040
day and

1082
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,720
work and who knows how many of these are

1083
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,359
just concordances versus total logical

1084
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,480
but

1085
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
accuracy within a model

1086
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
is like

1087
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,160
pragmatic aims within a model with the

1088
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,400
imperative to prefer to fit as much data

1089
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,520
as possible

1090
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
and then it's like

1091
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,760
um conservative

1092
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,560
um

1093
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,480
using the reward structure that worked

1094
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
at one time step

1095
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
using that generative model moving

1096
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
forward versus changing it

1097
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,640
any sort of dispersion around the

1098
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,480
parameters as

1099
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,240
evidenced at the lowest level of the

1100
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
chain the position of the particles

1101
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,960
or the actual parameter that's being

1102
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,720
modeled like the actual

1103
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,520
image that's being percepted on

1104
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
versus these higher generative models

1105
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,839
which don't realize like at the kind

1106
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,920
of um you know tip of a javelin so to

1107
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,960
speak

1108
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,079
so then the signal and noise is also

1109
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,040
like

1110
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
conservation and dissipation

1111
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,640
with

1112
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,800
respect to the model and then that is

1113
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,280
coming all the way back to morphology

1114
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,319
with like the position in stasis versus

1115
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,119
vibration of the particle from thermal

1116
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,400
so it's like a lot that gets

1117
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,640
linked here but

1118
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,319
where's least action in all of this

1119
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,880
like

1120
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,359
yeah blue

1121
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,040
so just to read a quote

1122
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
from the paper

1123
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,680
it says

1124
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,839
since

1125
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,920
self-organizing open systems are not

1126
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,200
conservative

1127
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,040
their structured flow is

1128
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,119
quintessentially dissipated dissipative

1129
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,440
and so and and that's like you know down

1130
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,280
it's in the third paragraph in the least

1131
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,920
action principle section

1132
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,079
so it just that goes back to what i was

1133
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,960
saying um earlier

1134
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,160
like

1135
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
does that equate to death like when the

1136
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,200
system

1137
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
totally dissipates like it's ultimately

1138
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,280
dissipative so you know we stay in this

1139
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,560
like nest for a little while and then

1140
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
we dissipate right like is that can can

1141
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,079
it be modeled like these processes using

1142
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,440
these equations i find that super

1143
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,839
interesting

1144
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:06,960
yeah

1145
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,640
um thanks steven

1146
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,480
this this um this idea of the least

1147
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,079
action i think the timing of what blue

1148
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
was saying there as well is um

1149
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,400
it's least action maybe we should say

1150
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,720
dynamical least action as opposed to

1151
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,280
least action which we normally think of

1152
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,560
i.e

1153
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,920
well like i was saying reactants

1154
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,960
products

1155
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,880
what was what's the what's you know

1156
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,119
what's the route to get from a to b

1157
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,240
or the army lined up to

1158
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,079
final space

1159
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,640
um normally we are taking

1160
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
starting conditions ending conditions

1161
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,720
um or

1162
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
you know where i am now what's my goal

1163
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,720
what's the least to get there but those

1164
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,359
two things are defined in some ways

1165
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,280
they're they're definable so i think

1166
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
it's a good now

1167
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,920
all the bit in between

1168
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,560
is um

1169
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,000
trying to go to least action

1170
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
um

1171
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,880
in some way um using that kind of in in

1172
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,560
the space of chaos i suppose if we're

1173
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,520
going to take

1174
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,560
the kind of complexity approach in human

1175
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,680
systems

1176
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,119
um

1177
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,800
it's in a chaotic state where you're

1178
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,359
trying to at some time um make sense of

1179
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,119
how to act

1180
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
but however

1181
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
you know in some ways there's only

1182
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,040
chaos moving into complexity

1183
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
which is available

1184
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,359
at some biological

1185
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,240
systems theoretically maybe not the idea

1186
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,119
of complicated and

1187
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,119
kind of simple

1188
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,200
sort of reproductive

1189
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,079
sort of

1190
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,599
steady

1191
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,520
like equilibrium state systems like

1192
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,680
mechanical systems aren't necessarily

1193
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,280
available although you could argue that

1194
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,640
maybe certain properties of our

1195
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
morphology like our

1196
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,319
um

1197
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,640
our bone structure and that so gives

1198
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,960
something which is approximate to that

1199
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,839
um

1200
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,160
once we know how to move our arm we have

1201
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,640
a relatively simple

1202
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,560
thing that we can now

1203
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,800
bring into our regime of attention but

1204
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,560
uh yeah i wonder what people think of

1205
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,839
dynamical least action is is somehow

1206
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,799
what's going on here

1207
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
yeah thanks steven just

1208
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,920
here's one

1209
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,359
take on that it's a good

1210
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,520
idea question i hope this is accurate

1211
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,720
too because

1212
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,079
i think we're all

1213
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,440
learning here but this is definitely a

1214
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
really

1215
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,079
challenging area in some ways to

1216
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,760
approach especially

1217
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,480
given our realistically limited

1218
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,079
familiarity

1219
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,440
so

1220
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,960
again it'd be awesome for people who

1221
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,240
have more familiarity with these

1222
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,599
equations to

1223
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,839
join us like either in preparation or

1224
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,680
even just joining us on these streams so

1225
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,280
that we can actually

1226
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
learn and connect to these other areas

1227
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,720
somebody who sees this formalism like

1228
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,560
every day just like we might see some

1229
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,520
other one

1230
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,480
okay

1231
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,359
but

1232
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,280
stephen brought up is this a dynamical

1233
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,200
leased auction okay so first kind of

1234
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,040
a hopefully non-contentious point that

1235
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,280
we're analyzing what we model we can

1236
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,920
only ask the computer to calculate the

1237
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,240
numbers that we ask it to model and add

1238
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
we can't expect something that goes

1239
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,319
truly beyond that not to say that the

1240
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,000
models can't have surprising outputs or

1241
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,480
interactions etc but we can't have it go

1242
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
beyond what we specify

1243
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,520
and

1244
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,119
the model

1245
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:33,839
is

1246
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
over x tilde

1247
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,599
which is the generalized coordinates of

1248
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,000
motion which is the position

1249
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,760
and all of the higher derivatives the

1250
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,640
whole

1251
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,440
integrator chain

1252
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
position in all higher order moments of

1253
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,359
the statistical distribution they're

1254
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,280
called moments like the first second

1255
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,359
third moment of the derivatives of the

1256
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,680
statistical distribution

1257
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,079
and these are basically

1258
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,319
terms of approximation of motion

1259
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,960
that allow a high order like a taylor

1260
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,040
series approximation or a volterra

1261
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,119
series approximation

1262
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,400
to

1263
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,880
allow snapshot modeling

1264
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
with real-time flow

1265
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,160
action cognition perception it's the

1266
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,000
flow over

1267
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,119
as

1268
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,960
gets explored

1269
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,760
the

1270
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,119
blanket

1271
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,440
states this is like the flow over s a

1272
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,400
and i

1273
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,960
states actions and um internal states

1274
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,280
so like this is

1275
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,800
enabling a flow description of

1276
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,200
markov blanket states

1277
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,040
and their

1278
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,119
perception cognition action their flow

1279
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,280
overstates their change their time

1280
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,839
including higher order moments of time

1281
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,800
so that it is a dynamical systems model

1282
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,880
but still there has to be a snapshot

1283
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,520
like a time series model of a stock

1284
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,640
price

1285
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,880
it has a value at

1286
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,119
whatever time resolution or continuous

1287
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,319
or discrete

1288
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,640
it's being time series modeled at

1289
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,040
so it's kind of the relationship between

1290
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,599
snapshot modeling and capturing higher

1291
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,359
order trends

1292
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,960
and this is a certain way to think about

1293
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,720
that

1294
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,079
in the direction that they're going to

1295
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,040
take it

1296
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,760
towards the markov blanket partitioning

1297
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,440
and bridging it to everything that that

1298
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,960
affords okay

1299
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,240
um dean and then stephen

1300
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,280
this is really important because i think

1301
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,599
it i want to tease something that maybe

1302
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,720
we can look at right right here but only

1303
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,319
in the 0.2 so

1304
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,440
between the

1305
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,000
us doing the live stream zero

1306
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,839
and today

1307
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,960
there was a report about the rate at

1308
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,160
which

1309
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,680
climate i think was the u.n report the

1310
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,119
rate at which climate change is

1311
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,280
happening so rapidly that

1312
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,640
as as

1313
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,160
the people who are

1314
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,119
sort of

1315
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,880
in that highly

1316
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,599
changing flow state aren't able to

1317
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,720
necessarily going to be able to adapt

1318
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,680
to the rate of change and so i wonder if

1319
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,559
some of what this paper speaks to

1320
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,960
might help us understand

1321
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,079
why

1322
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,400
the authors of that report

1323
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,119
are indicating to us that the

1324
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,160
the environment in which we we are

1325
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,640
existing in is going to change so

1326
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,680
quickly

1327
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,119
that as cells within that larger

1328
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,240
structure

1329
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,000
our form is not going to be able to

1330
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,319
adapt quickly enough

1331
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,119
to the way that the

1332
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,880
external system is is changing so i want

1333
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,559
to save that for the point too but i

1334
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,119
think this least action principle part

1335
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,079
would be a good entry point into some of

1336
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,160
these bigger questions going forward so

1337
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,319
i just want to park that but i think it

1338
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,240
matters

1339
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,760
yeah just to give one

1340
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
note on that

1341
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,000
the rate of change and how it changes

1342
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
those are kind of natural language

1343
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,000
descriptions of

1344
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,319
derivatives of how things are changing

1345
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,839
might be a simple

1346
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,359
claim to some but that's really

1347
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,680
important to keep in mind so how things

1348
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,440
are changing

1349
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,760
and then that's always going to be

1350
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,960
unknown

1351
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,119
to some degree

1352
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,079
so

1353
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,160
how things change and so on this is the

1354
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,880
generalized coordinates of motion

1355
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,520
and so it is about modeling rates of

1356
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,800
change and predictability of systems um

1357
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,880
that i've raised to change and

1358
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,079
okay yes

1359
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,480
stephen

1360
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,960
with this you we mentioned there about

1361
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,079
your action perception cognition and in

1362
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,319
some ways the cognition is

1363
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,160
organization on

1364
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,920
the generative model and the genitive

1365
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,280
model

1366
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,520
is

1367
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,359
an action

1368
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,240
policy model okay so we've got this

1369
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,040
recognition coming in but it's drive by

1370
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,359
this action and of course one challenge

1371
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,559
you've got in the climate change

1372
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,280
scenario is um

1373
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,880
really what you think is

1374
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,200
one thing but being able to act and

1375
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,160
being

1376
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,920
i mean the danger is we hit a point

1377
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,000
where no matter how much we know is

1378
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,480
beyond the ability to act

1379
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,440
in our

1380
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,240
capabilities and uh capacities as a as a

1381
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,800
as a species um

1382
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,160
the

1383
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
so this this while i think the word

1384
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,680
cognition is useful it may be useful to

1385
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,359
be careful just that

1386
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,079
the inference process is more general

1387
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,839
because it can be it can be a process

1388
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,079
which is like say happening beyond

1389
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,119
thought

1390
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,480
um so

1391
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,839
thought is a

1392
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,640
is is another action

1393
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,240
almost giving a higher order

1394
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,800
understanding on the generative motion

1395
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,400
product generative model for an action

1396
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,920
in active influence

1397
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,359
and of course a lot of

1398
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,079
what's going on underneath is is beyond

1399
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,480
our perception

1400
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,160
literally um way beyond so

1401
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,119
uh that that that can be interesting or

1402
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,319
useful to

1403
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,880
strip out

1404
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,960
nice

1405
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,720
yeah blue thanks

1406
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,839
so just to kind of go back to dynamical

1407
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,640
least action i do think that that's what

1408
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,240
they're referring to

1409
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,839
at the very end of the section the

1410
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,280
authors say

1411
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,599
from our perspective the key observation

1412
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,160
here is that any dissipative random

1413
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,720
dynamical system can be formulated as

1414
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,160
gradient flow

1415
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,880
on the log likelihood of its states this

1416
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,480
is reflected in our solution to the

1417
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,880
focker planck equation in 17

1418
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,359
which means the action is the time or

1419
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,920
path integral of the marginal likelihood

1420
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
or self-information

1421
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,079
for any system or model m

1422
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,400
so this is really the key thing this

1423
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,880
means the least action integral over the

1424
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,520
lagrangian turns into an integration

1425
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,000
over the self-information of states

1426
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,319
which is known as entropy in information

1427
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,880
theory in short the principle of least

1428
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
action manifests as a principle of least

1429
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,520
entropy for systems that possess a

1430
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,760
random dynamical attractor and thereby

1431
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,240
obtain non-equilibrium steady state

1432
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,520
thanks a lot blue great

1433
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,359
um point

1434
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,040
good day franz

1435
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,359
hi hi sorry that i'm late and uh i

1436
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,119
only have a half an hour too i'm in the

1437
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,960
middle of fighting preschool so daycare

1438
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,200
is a whole mess right now i do apologize

1439
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
i do want to take this time

1440
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
it's a little bit of a mess next week

1441
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,440
should be better i think we found school

1442
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,400
so hopefully next time here we go

1443
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,640
easy

1444
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,319
cool

1445
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,400
unexpected but preferred you know how

1446
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,000
will we model that

1447
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,400
um but thanks a lot for joining this is

1448
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,160
really cool

1449
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,119
so we were just describing

1450
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,040
some of the formalisms but

1451
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,200
where would you like to begin it'd be

1452
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,960
awesome to hear like any

1453
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,680
just introduction and context on the

1454
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,440
paper and then we kind of jumped in at

1455
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,640
least action

1456
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,079
and would love to hear your take on that

1457
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,359
sure

1458
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,599
um all right slow interactions i guess

1459
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,880
um i'll decide myself so um i i work in

1460
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,520
mclean's lab and tufts and doing a phd

1461
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,880
in biology

1462
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,240
and this is

1463
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
the whole kind of active inference um

1464
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,640
part of my work is came actually before

1465
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,119
my entire phd so i joined mike's lab

1466
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,480
because i wanted to

1467
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,079
really learn what kind of information

1468
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,079
and physics do in a biology context i

1469
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,280
didn't i didn't want to study the whole

1470
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,319
level of

1471
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,480
you know i mean i'm still doing as a

1472
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,079
technique but i didn't want to have the

1473
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,160
focus on protein interaction and you

1474
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,880
know genetic information um where you

1475
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,480
measure all these things so i was based

1476
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,160
on something a bit more broader than

1477
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,880
that

1478
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,400
and so when i reached out to him like

1479
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,880
and once i got some accepted he um i was

1480
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,079
like you know i have some months to kill

1481
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,599
can you send me somewhere or do

1482
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,359
something cool and then he sent me to

1483
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,799
carl frist and that's when that's the

1484
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,319
first time i heard the term active

1485
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,079
inference so i spent about four months

1486
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,599
in carl's lab

1487
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,760
um and then basically started working on

1488
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,280
on on the

1489
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,200
i think half the work in the paper i was

1490
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,559
actually done in those those couple

1491
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,280
months and when i was in carl's lab

1492
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,480
so the the overall goal of the paper and

1493
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,720
of that part of my work is to see if we

1494
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,480
look at morphogenesis and

1495
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,359
similar biological processes can we look

1496
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,200
at something where you have a very kind

1497
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,920
of um kind of baseline stem cell like

1498
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,200
behavior where you have cells that kind

1499
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,799
of do like a morphogenesis basically i

1500
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,680
don't know how much you're familiar with

1501
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,599
the whole biology aspect of this paper

1502
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,839
but essentially it's the ideas you model

1503
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,680
cells that are uninformed they have some

1504
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,200
kind of you know genetic code something

1505
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,920
that encodes their their their structure

1506
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,640
the

1507
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,240
the basically you have the genetic

1508
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,440
process already ingrained in the

1509
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,079
genitive model into the into the cells

1510
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,680
but they're completely by their stem

1511
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,520
cell like they don't have actually yet

1512
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,079
achieved their final form um and they're

1513
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,760
just like in the simulation and biology

1514
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,440
right they're starting off with very

1515
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,200
few asymmetries this i think there's a

1516
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,640
famous

1517
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,319
who said that but

1518
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,079
uh some physicians that once said most

1519
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,440
of physics is basically just uh

1520
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,599
symmetries that's symmetry everywhere

1521
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,599
and that's exactly kind of um

1522
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,520
how most biologies things but i'll just

1523
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,359
think of of morphogenesis there's some

1524
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,440
asymmetry in in the beginning

1525
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,119
in the egg where some there's some some

1526
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,640
different information

1527
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,240
some gradient of something some

1528
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,720
localization of certain agents and then

1529
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,040
from that on basically everything else

1530
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,559
just follows through

1531
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,319
but it's it's it's hard to believe

1532
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,599
that's the whole side of the story

1533
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,359
because there's just so much complexity

1534
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,160
and so many cells doing at the same time

1535
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,960
so

1536
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,200
if there isn't any capability for them

1537
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,040
to adapt to signals and environment and

1538
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,960
to learn from each other it's hard to

1539
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,160
believe that the time frame they're

1540
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,240
given they can really um you know

1541
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,000
achieve the complex morphogenesis

1542
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,440
outcomes that we know

1543
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,920
um do exist so coming to this paper

1544
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,680
basically this model is actually already

1545
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,160
um like the the father or mother of this

1546
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
paper was already done before i even

1547
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,319
heard of this topic that that was the

1548
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,160
knowing once place so the model

1549
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
structure itself was already done like i

1550
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,680
think called it most if not all of it

1551
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,440
and mike just basically

1552
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,920
was on the paper and giovanni as well

1553
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,000
they basically gave him some input on on

1554
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
on what

1555
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,760
what the background of biology would

1556
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,960
look like

1557
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,640
and so they already figured out

1558
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,480
basically let's do a simplistic model

1559
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,720
eight cells there's more as far as i

1560
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,640
know from carl and it's like myself in

1561
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,640
my simulations many practical concerns

1562
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,400
don't mind too complex

1563
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,720
if you have too many cells at once um

1564
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,000
then then you're gonna run into problems

1565
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
in the beginning something i actually

1566
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,599
added on to the model um even the

1567
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,760
baseline model was that damping

1568
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,079
parameter um which i talked later on in

1569
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,480
the results which might often like it's

1570
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,000
not a key part but i find it very

1571
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,599
interesting because that's one of the

1572
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,880
requirements for active infants um for

1573
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
for fear and energymization variation of

1574
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,640
the energy minimization there's a smooth

1575
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,319
landscape and when you have all these

1576
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,400
cells initially clustered together and

1577
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
they're trying to infer their place and

1578
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,160
they all kind of have some random

1579
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,319
randomly initialized prior beliefs they

1580
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,839
don't know where to go from there and if

1581
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:10,799
you

1582
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,200
right if you have already high precision

1583
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,799
in there and the sensory apparatus

1584
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,040
initially they have a really hard time

1585
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,119
they still end up mostly fine and

1586
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,720
getting later but they jump all over the

1587
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
place and you can imagine that'd be very

1588
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,640
bad for an anabolic scenario if every

1589
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,000
cell immediately jumps to the first

1590
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
queue they have we actually think now in

1591
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,640
the mclean labs that um a lot of cancer

1592
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,319
initiation happens a little bit like

1593
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,119
that where positions are as i said too

1594
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,760
high um there's a paper coming out soon

1595
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,680
by my colleague of mine that talks a bit

1596
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,599
more about that argument

1597
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,599
but so basically from

1598
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,160
um we had the target mythology already

1599
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,480
always encoded that and you saw what you

1600
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
see in the in the baseline control

1601
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,760
experiments was already done

1602
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,160
what i was interested in is basically

1603
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,240
again coming back to my my question and

1604
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,000
my approach to this from the biology

1605
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,200
side of you

1606
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,720
is how can we use the asp of information

1607
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,200
flow and specifically active inference

1608
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,000
to manipulate and base better control of

1609
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,880
genesis outcomes and control biology so

1610
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,040
the the two main results in that in that

1611
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,000
paper

1612
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,079
are looking at if you instead of you

1613
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,200
know stuff like a normal biology

1614
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
experiment where you basically interrupt

1615
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,040
one part of the machinery

1616
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,559
um and then see how everything reacts

1617
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,319
you actually control the process

1618
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,040
information processing itself

1619
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,839
so one was basically if you put in a

1620
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,920
an asymmetry and the response of the

1621
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,440
cells to their

1622
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,119
to the signaling

1623
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,280
um ligands they get the signaling

1624
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,200
concentrations in the environment

1625
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,359
how can you basically completely remodel

1626
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,480
the entire morphogenesis outcome

1627
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,559
even though you actually left the entire

1628
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,319
code itself that's always one thing i

1629
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,240
tried to stress in that paper the target

1630
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,760
methodology and all the simulations is

1631
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,440
exactly the same none of them they

1632
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,359
basically said exact coding

1633
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,440
um of what where they're supposed to be

1634
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
but how the process information has been

1635
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,720
changed

1636
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,480
um so the first figure is that where you

1637
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,559
have those two head and two tails um and

1638
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,160
if i did the details in the in that or

1639
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,599
if i just did it myself and then publish

1640
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
it i think it's in there as well

1641
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,960
um then

1642
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,480
that's basically something that we also

1643
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,839
see in the lab i think that was

1644
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,119
mentioned as well that that's something

1645
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,640
that that might have lab has done with

1646
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,920
an area where they basically induce

1647
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,280
those two head types right that's

1648
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,240
something that's really weird to

1649
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,799
biologists to and again in in the type

1650
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:23,520
of

1651
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,960
manipulations that we're doing all that

1652
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,640
happened in this lab they didn't

1653
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,880
manipulate the genetic and the natural

1654
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,440
code again the the dna from those panera

1655
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,520
that specifically was exactly the same

1656
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,599
but somehow they perturbed the actual

1657
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,359
bioelectric network

1658
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,680
um itself so basically on the state

1659
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,839
space essentially so that kind of like

1660
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,160
where this inspiration came from

1661
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,799
and then the second part where we the

1662
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,799
the malformation or i also talk about

1663
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,960
cancer information and of course it's

1664
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,839
it's

1665
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,960
completely called cancer because we

1666
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,960
didn't put proliferation in this in this

1667
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,960
um simulation so that's it's the

1668
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,040
initiation stage but it's the idea is

1669
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,640
that again under something that we

1670
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,960
talked about also in the lab and recall

1671
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,720
many emails afterwards and it kind of

1672
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,400
also goes back to this whole idea with

1673
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,760
um

1674
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,599
how how different psychiatric orders

1675
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,040
work in the brain where you have some of

1676
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,799
these inference processes being

1677
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,799
disrupted and then lead to large scale

1678
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,079
outcomes but they kind of start

1679
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,079
somewhere the idea was here is that if

1680
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,960
we disrupt only the um the information

1681
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,280
flow from one cell to the other cells

1682
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,119
and the other cells to that one cell

1683
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,559
then what would what would that cell do

1684
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,640
so basically just completely reduced its

1685
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,920
um

1686
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,240
sensitivity to the environment

1687
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,160
um and then saw it happen and what

1688
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,920
happened was that this one cell

1689
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,520
basically kind of like

1690
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,680
it didn't it didn't move a whole lot it

1691
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,839
got it inferred the wrong kind of cell

1692
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:42,880
type

1693
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
um and it was completely out of place

1694
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,119
right so that's always baton biology if

1695
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,119
a cell is doing something that's not

1696
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,400
supposed to in a place where it's not

1697
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,760
supposed to be um and what i thought was

1698
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,079
interesting afterwards well okay so how

1699
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,160
can we rescue that and again like right

1700
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,599
i'm not trying to rescue it in a

1701
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,079
traditional cancer therapy idea where

1702
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,240
you bombard the cell or just kill it how

1703
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,160
can you actually have the system remodel

1704
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,319
itself so that the idea was to

1705
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,799
increase the um so the sensitivity was

1706
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,799
still disrupted from that one cell but

1707
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,200
then the flow like how much concentrate

1708
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,119
how much the other cells reacted to it

1709
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,880
so basically we manipulated how the

1710
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
information flow from the other cells to

1711
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,119
that cells was flowing and increased

1712
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,160
that

1713
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,319
so and then what was interesting is that

1714
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,079
the kind of they were just kind of like

1715
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,599
going more closely into an interaction

1716
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,079
we just seen this time lapse figure

1717
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,960
um and then eventually they reshape so

1718
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,160
even though the cells like normally if

1719
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,760
you run this it's a deterministic

1720
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,599
simulation right it's like um it's

1721
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,119
random it's always the same random seed

1722
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,160
so you run the simulation and you want

1723
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,079
again it'll be awesome outcome so you

1724
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,920
can kind of know which cells go where

1725
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,680
even though you know no cell starts off

1726
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,520
with like knowing i'm supposed to be in

1727
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,920
that cell that's not how it happens but

1728
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
because we run the simulation with a

1729
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,319
fixed and randomized seed we always know

1730
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,160
which cell ends up going where and and

1731
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,559
then in that cancer simulation that was

1732
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,160
not the same anymore so actually even

1733
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,599
though at the end after that rescue

1734
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,960
experiment they ended up with a

1735
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,359
perfectly normal shape and then followed

1736
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,520
in the mythology at the end it wasn't

1737
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,720
what normally was supposed to happen

1738
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,720
right the cells that normally have gone

1739
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,480
to their fixed positions didn't all do

1740
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,960
that so there was some reconfiguration

1741
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,480
which is something that that's that's an

1742
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,000
ideal strategy that you would like right

1743
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,079
something that you exploit the system's

1744
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,240
interaction itself to then rescue it and

1745
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,480
overall target more you want to work on

1746
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,160
the the phenotype but you want to work

1747
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,920
on what's actually wrong you don't care

1748
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,480
exactly what cell does and and is

1749
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,559
implemented there's a lot of cool

1750
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,240
science little tangential but that's

1751
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,760
really cool work but eve marta that

1752
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,559
works on neuronal networks and lobsters

1753
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,960
where they see that this works in life

1754
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,559
vegas it's a simple enough system to

1755
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,559
work only but what they're seeing is

1756
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,839
there's actually a multitude of

1757
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,240
implemented implementations that the new

1758
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,440
neural neural network can can use and do

1759
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,440
use individuals these entirely different

1760
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,079
parameters with like two to four full

1761
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,200
differences in iron challenge

1762
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,280
concentrations to achieve the same end

1763
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,440
result and it's actually the the

1764
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,280
response to resilience to stress to

1765
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,359
perturbations in the environment is that

1766
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,440
in the details but in the end the actual

1767
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,520
homeostatic aspect of it is kept the

1768
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,240
same right the goal of having something

1769
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,920
um end up the same

1770
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,680
stephen would like to speak uh go go

1771
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,440
ahead

1772
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,000
oh hi thanks yeah i was just gonna

1773
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,599
one question

1774
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,720
is

1775
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,079
the idea of flow in a way more flow is

1776
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,359
better

1777
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,480
even though that

1778
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,440
um so unlike i say a generative model

1779
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,480
where you maybe don't want too much

1780
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,839
complexity

1781
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,520
you can have a lot of flow but as long

1782
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,440
as that flows not noise um

1783
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,240
it just is able to inform so that's the

1784
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,400
first part and the second part is are

1785
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,680
you saying it's

1786
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,039
with this flow it's about finding

1787
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,960
where the choice point is or whether the

1788
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,640
threshold is to say

1789
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,720
okay that's now

1790
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,720
going to decide that that's going to

1791
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,440
create a morphological

1792
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,039
target

1793
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,440
as opposed to it just being a gradual

1794
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,520
gradient descent on energy

1795
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,839
it it is more aggression aspect so the

1796
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,720
it is i would say it's it's not ideal to

1797
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,200
think about decision points even though

1798
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,400
in the end it doesn't happen it's

1799
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,440
something that we're just we're used to

1800
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,200
in our level of speech

1801
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,760
but on the level of of outside online

1802
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,520
cells that is very much gradual process

1803
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,359
right at this basically you have all

1804
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,640
these different probabilities which are

1805
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,240
probabilities of being one cell in the

1806
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,839
other and the simulation

1807
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,599
and uh the idea of increasing

1808
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,200
information flow or increased

1809
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,799
sensitivity with our aspect your

1810
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,720
modeling and manipulating or precision

1811
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,760
as well

1812
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,880
is that you are trying to get

1813
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,559
the vibration for energy to be minimized

1814
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,119
but also specifically to converge on a

1815
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,319
system where those probabilities

1816
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,920
actually end up somewhere meaningful

1817
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,280
right where if you don't want to be in a

1818
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,319
state where they're constantly

1819
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,240
fluctuating constantly randomized either

1820
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,520
you mentioned noise that's one aspect

1821
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,599
you want to avoid you also want to avoid

1822
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,520
that they basically um

1823
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,839
do this and like that

1824
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,039
that's where you write the decision

1825
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,319
point right like that the cell is

1826
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,680
basically going towards one state and

1827
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,039
then there was a wrong one and then you

1828
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,480
increase the information flow of the

1829
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,240
other cells and the cancer rescue from

1830
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,680
um stimulation

1831
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,359
to bring it away from that but you're

1832
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,559
not

1833
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,559
you first of all not actually working on

1834
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,720
like you know identifying that point and

1835
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,160
then you're fixing that you're basically

1836
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,640
just just uh realizing that the

1837
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,319
the simulation overall basically you

1838
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,559
basically look at the the probability

1839
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,079
changes over time so how are they

1840
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,000
updating and how fast are they updating

1841
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,119
and then of course in the end what are

1842
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,640
they updating towards and that gives you

1843
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,599
a cue

1844
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,440
if you think from experimental point of

1845
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,799
view or even like experimental

1846
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,960
assimilation or point of view then that

1847
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,520
tells you okay so um if if that happened

1848
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,280
too fast if there was

1849
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,200
malformation happening too fast then you

1850
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,880
probably want to act and you want to

1851
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,039
increase sensitivity or something um

1852
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,160
early on but you don't do it at one time

1853
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,440
you just set the parameters for the

1854
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,799
whole simulations but it tells you

1855
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,760
basically the strength that the

1856
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,160
sensitivity is with respect to how early

1857
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,760
and how strongly that misinformation is

1858
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,359
happening does that answer your question

1859
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:00,640
somewhere

1860
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,200
yeah i think that does one i suppose one

1861
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,599
question just on that is

1862
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,960
is it

1863
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,440
is there like an optimum level in terms

1864
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
of this flow

1865
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,480
um i it peaks or is it like the more

1866
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,880
flow you can get the better it's just

1867
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,079
literally

1868
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,280
a limit on

1869
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,880
how much information flow is possible

1870
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
um

1871
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,440
well the short answer is that the boring

1872
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,799
answer is that always will depend on the

1873
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,880
context i would say um there is no i i

1874
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,640
don't think you can say you know more

1875
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,720
like the broad statement like more

1876
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,480
information feels always better

1877
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,839
doesn't make sense i think you already

1878
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,520
gave the answer to that why that is

1879
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,599
right because you in the end it will end

1880
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,280
up too much noise based on the system so

1881
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,200
that answer has to be a respect of how

1882
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,599
much information actually is being can

1883
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,839
be processed what is the time scale of

1884
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,079
the sensory parameters some my

1885
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,799
experimental work works a lot on um i'm

1886
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,880
basically having different uh

1887
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,720
variation of input signals to my model

1888
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,640
system which is actually an algae i'll

1889
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,400
get to that but long story short i

1890
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,920
actually had once got the question that

1891
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,680
where i was at these randomized signals

1892
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,160
and that was defeating it um and then

1893
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,520
someone asked like well you actually

1894
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,238
this is actually taking more information

1895
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:17,198
because you're having and i was like

1896
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,560
well and that like white noise

1897
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,238
technically carries more right more

1898
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,080
variation but it's not informative right

1899
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,279
so that's

1900
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,960
more information flow by itself is not

1901
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,679
better more informative information flow

1902
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,359
the informative part being is actually

1903
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,960
does it how quick does it change over

1904
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,399
time so there's a lot of important

1905
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,120
aspect other directors there and with

1906
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,198
respect to also the sensory precision

1907
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,640
and you know the timings there's certain

1908
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,399
time scales involved in like how center

1909
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:41,839
space how fast

1910
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,920
sensory states lead to updates of

1911
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,359
internal states

1912
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,679
all these things together make up

1913
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,679
basically how fast an agent can react

1914
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,759
and uh how much information can process

1915
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:52,880
and that's

1916
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,399
the optimal level will be dependent on

1917
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,278
that essentially

1918
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,080
okay awesome dean or blue before we have

1919
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,799
anyone go again

1920
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,359
so i have a question um can you flip to

1921
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,000
figure four daniel please yep um

1922
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,479
just so you had mentioned earlier on hi

1923
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,839
by the way it's nice to see you i'm

1924
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,279
really glad

1925
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,920
we i'm glad you couldn't make it

1926
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,880
it's a pleasant surprise um but here in

1927
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,799
figure four you mentioned that you

1928
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,839
didn't

1929
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,920
model proliferation in this model but

1930
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,319
it seems to me that there's like more

1931
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,520
like it looks proliferative here so is

1932
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,839
it just like a very dense cluster at the

1933
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,080
first time step or do you duplicate it

1934
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,080
every time step or like how

1935
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,799
how did you end up with so many more um

1936
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:43,839
like

1937
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,319
beads or or whatever you know agents uh

1938
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,198
cells at the end than at the beginning

1939
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,158
that there might be an optical um so

1940
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:53,759
a communication problem on my part so

1941
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,840
the the the

1942
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
the actual cells are eight in each of

1943
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
those images all of them

1944
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,520
but what you're seeing is the trace of

1945
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,199
it right so only the ones that have like

1946
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,360
the the the strongly colored dot and

1947
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,040
then like the little star around it at

1948
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,880
the end right if you look at the last

1949
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,800
frames on there those are actually the

1950
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,640
the cells and what you see in the back

1951
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,719
is basically like time lapse kind of

1952
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:15,440
like

1953
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,880
snip snip snip shots they're not

1954
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,480
actually cells in there

1955
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,480
uh it would be actually interesting i

1956
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,000
know you even thought of that that would

1957
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,920
actually be a fairly simple uh

1958
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,360
introduction that each of those point

1959
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,360
steps you just make that and you sell

1960
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,199
that'll be pretty cool actually um i i

1961
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,600
know i i think basically carl

1962
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,440
i know and one of us when he initially

1963
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,760
published that i think he had way at the

1964
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,679
end of the simulations he basically just

1965
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,080
added some new cells but he never went

1966
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,520
further with that and i think it's the

1967
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,199
same problem that i mentioned that when

1968
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,640
you have it initially and like in the

1969
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,040
first time frame at t equals one

1970
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,480
that if you have to make cells close

1971
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,480
together it's um you have to kind of set

1972
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,640
the sense the precision lower because

1973
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,239
otherwise they're too close together i

1974
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,960
mean it works somewhat but it's very

1975
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,360
susceptible to perturbation at that

1976
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,400
stage

1977
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,840
so in order if you basically want to

1978
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,480
reintroduce perforation either like you

1979
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,040
said or like like you gave me the idea

1980
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,960
to do in between what you do at the end

1981
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,320
you would have to have more which of

1982
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,760
course what cells do right if you have

1983
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,040
new transformation that are not going to

1984
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,960
be the same kind of sense of rest that

1985
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,360
than a mature or a form cell is

1986
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,120
um but that was basically i think just

1987
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,560
for the simulation what was making a

1988
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,960
little bit complicated but um

1989
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,120
it is i'm not right now actively working

1990
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,600
on that simulation anymore if i did

1991
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,040
um that would be great yeah maybe i'll

1992
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,159
come back to that

1993
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,440
no that would be way cool and if it

1994
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,199
needs to be like less sensitive at the

1995
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,520
beginning like you just double the urge

1996
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,280
or yeah you just double the sensitivity

1997
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,520
at each um time step and then that way

1998
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,719
like you know you would get that

1999
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,800
enhanced sensitivity over time and it's

2000
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,239
also very interesting from the point of

2001
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,600
view of fractals and there's something

2002
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,800
really cool right right now all stuff

2003
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,719
but i recently read that wolfram the guy

2004
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,159
behind often alpha

2005
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,679
he's like signing this whole new physics

2006
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,040
approach where they basically just have

2007
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,480
simple set of rules and then they just

2008
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,239
use fractal kind of multiplications and

2009
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,760
then each each time that that goes on

2010
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,120
and they create all these kind of physic

2011
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,080
laws

2012
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,159
um which i haven't yet gotten deep into

2013
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,760
i can't really say anything about how

2014
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,520
good and useful that is but

2015
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,000
the fact that we all know is a very kind

2016
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,679
of informative

2017
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:10,880
mechanism that's used in biology

2018
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,080
extensively

2019
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,360
um and that's something you could use

2020
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,120
here as well where basically each step

2021
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
where you introduce a new cell you kind

2022
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,800
of just have the same rule set with the

2023
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,640
initial and you run like a

2024
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,560
small simulation in that simulation

2025
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,960
essentially and with the same simple set

2026
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,239
of rules you could probably make up a

2027
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,840
whole much more complex so it probably

2028
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,199
looked nothing like this i i wouldn't

2029
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,560
expect this to then afterwards still

2030
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,960
have like the same shape but

2031
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,960
cool stuff cool ideas about the top

2032
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,800
just kind of unpack that because it's a

2033
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,760
great suggestion and thanks for kind of

2034
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,040
giving your take on two friends it's

2035
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,360
really cool to hear like when the cells

2036
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,600
divide you may need a first symmetry

2037
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,600
breaker to introduce a symmetry break

2038
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,920
you get some gradient it can be gravity

2039
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,600
it could be a nutrient gradient it can

2040
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,159
be the entry point of the sperm that

2041
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,560
triggers a calcium wave but it's like

2042
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,800
asymmetries can give rise to asymmetries

2043
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,400
and then interacting you get two

2044
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,640
morphogens and then now it's high high

2045
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,440
and low low and then the alternations

2046
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,960
influence gene regulation and that's

2047
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,480
like very complex but um

2048
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
adjacency effects are really important

2049
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,600
and that's how we get the

2050
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,320
self-organization like of the insect eye

2051
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,199
or of tissues because they don't have to

2052
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,719
do what this challenge is which is sort

2053
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,000
of like getting formation spaced out

2054
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,159
this is like the bird flock morphology

2055
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,600
which is also so cool because it does

2056
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,520
apply to other systems too

2057
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,600
which i'm sure we'll be exploring more

2058
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,280
but like

2059
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,920
bodies fill out into a morphology not

2060
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,040
just

2061
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,760
dissolve this is yeah cool though i mean

2062
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,600
of course we really

2063
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
learned a lot let's return to least

2064
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,239
action just and feel free just to leave

2065
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,000
any time you'd like but on least action

2066
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,600
where does it come into play

2067
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,840
or what is it doing here

2068
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,520
yes so it's

2069
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,600
that was more of a background um section

2070
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,640
so um

2071
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,480
georgie gorgiev who is also on on that

2072
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,560
paper is also my um

2073
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,560
excellent bertie supervisor

2074
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,040
um we kind of talked to him because

2075
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,960
this is not nothing that i did and there

2076
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,760
was like novel um i didn't like

2077
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,679
it was not the way we framed it but i

2078
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,040
didn't make it i didn't make new map for

2079
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,199
that but the idea was that is that what

2080
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,120
what yogi um who's doing all these

2081
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,040
action principles you know the classical

2082
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,199
action principles applied to biology

2083
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,199
questions and he was like well you know

2084
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,560
it's really

2085
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,840
um i think you're missing like a

2086
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,440
communication um

2087
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,640
aspect of this where you're like you're

2088
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,920
not going to be committing clearly how

2089
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,320
this fits into these action principles

2090
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,440
um and you're not going clearly of of

2091
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,400
what

2092
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,480
like where diverge essentially and um

2093
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,920
car actually did by a people on to

2094
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,920
whether he sprinkles in there but i want

2095
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,440
to make this more explicit essentially

2096
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,600
that that the variation pure aviation

2097
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,840
principle is at least action principles

2098
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,000
by definition essentially but what i was

2099
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,159
trying to show here is um is simply kind

2100
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,719
of like the the whole idea of this paper

2101
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,320
from from background was that we could

2102
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
anyone could start from this that has

2103
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,760
more of a physics background and then

2104
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,520
can work themselves to

2105
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,080
through active inference to biology and

2106
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,960
it's not that something that's

2107
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,640
physically very familiar with white and

2108
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,120
and the idea is actually where does this

2109
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,800
um what is the interesting take on it

2110
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,120
from the from the from the variational

2111
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,400
free energy

2112
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,800
and that's what um i think in the so you

2113
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,719
start this general definition what is an

2114
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:25,760
extrema

2115
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,920
and then you kind of see later on that

2116
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,320
the the whole definition of the

2117
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,199
um

2118
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,719
of the global clever diversion of

2119
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,000
innovation of energy very much

2120
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,480
corresponds to that and it's also

2121
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,239
um just interesting to see basically

2122
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,600
where where that takes from so that

2123
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,960
that's not that answers your question

2124
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,480
that's basically that the point of that

2125
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,840
was more

2126
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,159
not not that least action that i used

2127
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,520
that particular equation i didn't use

2128
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,320
the classical uh the typical equations

2129
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,760
that carl uses for his variation for

2130
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,920
energy there's more motivation and i

2131
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,480
hope that goes to show essentially where

2132
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,320
this all flows from like how how do you

2133
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,600
get from

2134
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,760
from you know from from from from the

2135
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,040
opponent function in the beginning for

2136
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,280
stability how or lagrangian function how

2137
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,120
do you get from that to a variational

2138
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,280
peer energy to really make that

2139
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,440
um kind of integration into physics

2140
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,679
tighter which i know i failed at because

2141
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,440
there were the comments to that paper

2142
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,719
that were published with it and if you

2143
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,880
read that one two of them were like

2144
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,480
you still don't see how the integration

2145
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,239
is doing then my comment to that was

2146
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,480
then i think i called that that mini

2147
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,080
paper response paper like a cheaper

2148
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,520
integration to physics so i know i

2149
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,679
didn't succeed in that i apologize but

2150
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,320
that was the goal

2151
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,560
okay awesome

2152
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,800
dean

2153
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,560
would you like to go anywhere ask

2154
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,840
anything

2155
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,960
yeah i i don't even know no i'm just

2156
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,040
gonna sit back and then

2157
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,719
because

2158
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,840
well well for me

2159
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,840
you've taken a whole bunch of stuff

2160
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,000
around what a form

2161
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,760
might turn into

2162
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,280
based on what signals it's

2163
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,960
capable of

2164
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,520
acting on is that

2165
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,960
is that

2166
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,880
a gross besides being a crossover

2167
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,360
simplification can we start there does

2168
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,120
that make sense

2169
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,199
yeah so like

2170
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,199
yes yes that makes sense basically what

2171
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,400
what

2172
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,679
i always like like talking about models

2173
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,800
like what you put in what you get out

2174
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,560
right so what we put into the model is

2175
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,719
it's an encoding of signaling responses

2176
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,080
which is like a classical like if you

2177
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,320
see signaling a b but not much of c and

2178
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,040
d

2179
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,360
then you think your cell type

2180
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,239
a whatever that means head type and then

2181
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,640
you adjust your own signaling expression

2182
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,000
so each cell basically has four

2183
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,480
signaling molecules um that they can

2184
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,719
exchange they can express they can sense

2185
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,400
and based on different combinations of

2186
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,600
those they think they're one or the

2187
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,480
other

2188
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,440
um and and that is semi-place encoded um

2189
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,040
so they have basically from that map

2190
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,800
that's what the type of morphology is is

2191
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,960
meaning so what we put in basically is

2192
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,600
is uh is that encoding the genetic model

2193
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,360
um genetic process how they update that

2194
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,600
the the particular diffusion constants

2195
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,800
all that stuff that basically holds

2196
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,199
information and spreads to each other

2197
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,320
and then what we get out essentially is

2198
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,159
is what kind of shapes like you said can

2199
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,560
can emerge from that um

2200
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,239
of course initially right the initial

2201
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,280
model was basically you're not

2202
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,400
interested in how many shapes because

2203
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,000
you're interested can do the shape that

2204
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,080
you put into it so the purpose of this

2205
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,159
paper was is keeping that same target

2206
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,360
the same kind of like i i um each cell

2207
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,120
has these options that it can be based

2208
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,800
on where it's sensing and then it's on

2209
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,280
secreting but keeping with that can you

2210
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,960
get different shapes

2211
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,120
just by messing up the way that the

2212
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,960
information flows in outside of the cell

2213
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,800
and it's being processed around the

2214
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,640
things that's again

2215
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,920
that the inspiration from that comes

2216
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,120
from the lab that i'm working on where

2217
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,800
we do a lot of this where we don't don't

2218
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,560
actually mess up the genetic genetic

2219
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,840
coding so we don't mess up the genetic

2220
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,080
model in inactive inference terms but we

2221
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,960
mess up how how basically the the state

2222
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,560
space looks like how information at each

2223
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,080
point in time times updated and that's

2224
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,960
that's the idea of this

2225
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,840
what does it look like to engineer or

2226
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,640
design a different target morphology

2227
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,719
how did you fit

2228
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,600
the bayesian model

2229
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
or fit the

2230
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,400
flow descriptor whatever it was in its

2231
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,520
representation towards the represent

2232
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,560
towards the um anatomy that's described

2233
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,320
in figure three

2234
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,920
yes so um

2235
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,920
the the the the outcomes that we get

2236
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,360
like the experimental outcomes here we

2237
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,280
didn't like design the

2238
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,880
fault like i said we keep those the same

2239
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,640
we just basically had some intuition

2240
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,800
that some of them found to be true of

2241
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,560
how we could change it based on just the

2242
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,719
asymmetry that we put in an information

2243
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,600
flow

2244
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,040
um how would we design this one um

2245
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,360
mainly so this is an active level and

2246
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,120
again this model itself is not that

2247
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,400
that's already called this before i

2248
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,239
joined it so that's not i didn't didn't

2249
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,080
do as new but how do you approach this

2250
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,239
so basically the idea is um this is the

2251
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,000
idea of is fairly biological the idea is

2252
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,120
that you have

2253
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,400
chilling encodings where certain

2254
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,920
transcription factors basically right

2255
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,800
will

2256
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,320
based on whatever you sense will then

2257
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,640
basically activate gene expression in

2258
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,239
the cells that were then allowed to

2259
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,760
differentiate so cells most of

2260
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
morphogenesis essentially starts off

2261
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,639
from

2262
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,440
um

2263
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,960
from something i mentioned initially you

2264
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,360
have some asymmetry in in signaling that

2265
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,880
there's this thought that basically even

2266
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,400
when you already have the

2267
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,600
the the unfairlist egg in an animal

2268
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,560
system

2269
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,159
there's some asymmetry word that's being

2270
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,560
stored actively by by the whole organism

2271
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,880
of the mother essentially and based on

2272
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,120
that asymmetry then you have gradient of

2273
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,480
already of difference and then so

2274
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
basically some cells will say will sense

2275
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,880
more of signaling type a and lesser b

2276
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,480
and then from that they will make they

2277
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,239
will be um so certain things will be

2278
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,159
expressed that will then um change the

2279
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,440
sulfate to a

2280
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,760
sub-sulfate and that and then you have

2281
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,199
more sulfates and the same thing happens

2282
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,360
there you have now more symmetry but

2283
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,280
starting off in the same one so you

2284
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,280
again will have cells that will sense

2285
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,960
more and less of some signaling

2286
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,440
thickness signaling ligands that will

2287
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,199
basically then turn out to

2288
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,480
be incorporated through transcription

2289
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,520
factors

2290
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,440
differential genetic expression

2291
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,520
um to differentiation

2292
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,239
so

2293
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,520
what this is essentially what this is

2294
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,440
doing right you're you're encoding what

2295
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,800
what the codes here are essentially

2296
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,920
those different

2297
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,920
uh relationships between transcription

2298
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,920
between signaling receptors

2299
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,679
transcription factors downstream two

2300
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,000
genetic code where then basically we

2301
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,280
don't do proliferation again but there's

2302
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,320
the the first step type there's

2303
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,320
basically one snippet of type mythology

2304
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,960
one aspect we have at that point in in

2305
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,639
this hypothetical morphogenesis

2306
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,000
experiments you have

2307
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,679
four different signaling type signaling

2308
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,239
cell type four different signaling

2309
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,400
ligands um that that are being that

2310
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,400
being expressed that can be expressed by

2311
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,719
the cells and based on where you are in

2312
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,480
the cluster you will see more or less of

2313
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,800
it and based on that information you

2314
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,960
will then yourself this cell start to

2315
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,040
express more or less of because you

2316
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,960
basically start differentiating

2317
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,639
um so then we'll start expressing more

2318
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,400
and less of that at some point of that

2319
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,920
you reach certain threshold where they

2320
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,320
actually will fully have undergone the

2321
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,320
differentiation process and have a new

2322
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,000
sulfate and that's what these different

2323
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,400
um head tail and stuff so of course like

2324
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,679
you know there's no

2325
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,600
animal system dyno off that has a you

2326
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,760
know eight cells and uh four cell types

2327
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,520
and makes a whole body that would be

2328
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,639
pretty crazy although there are some

2329
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,560
interesting um there's some small

2330
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,480
ornaments and systems where there are

2331
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,159
um the these um the c elegans these are

2332
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:23,600
one example where they have a a complete

2333
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,159
map from from from cell to cell from

2334
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,239
basically a gene so they know exactly

2335
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,400
which cell base it turns out um to be

2336
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,920
what cell the ends they can go from the

2337
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,760
embryo and they can tell exactly this

2338
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,120
cell is going to be at that at the end

2339
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,000
of time

2340
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,239
this is the minority of examples most uh

2341
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,239
assembled most modal origins i know a

2342
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,000
lot more messier than that and that's

2343
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,320
what this um trying to basically answer

2344
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,000
given that you have a lot of messi that

2345
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,400
but cells can be different things

2346
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,920
and then if perturbations happen like

2347
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,360
they happen all the time in environment

2348
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,880
and often we do see then you know

2349
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,880
misformed embryos a lot of that we start

2350
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,480
in the lab other labs to it too we sit

2351
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,920
in nature all the time

2352
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,480
where you get completely different um

2353
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,840
uh outcomes in the morphology even

2354
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,480
though not all of these occur because of

2355
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,639
some genetic mutation that's not always

2356
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,080
the case sometimes it's just basically

2357
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,080
perturbation environment and the same

2358
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,000
genetic code with some little

2359
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,920
differences that here

2360
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,520
is basically that the difference is here

2361
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,880
between one simulation and different if

2362
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,400
you did it that way we didn't but if you

2363
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,120
did

2364
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,960
at least not in this paper if you had

2365
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,120
different randomization initially of the

2366
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,800
prior beliefs you can also get different

2367
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,120
outcomes but um even with one

2368
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,239
randomization of of the initial beliefs

2369
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:33,920
you will get certain outcomes for those

2370
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,199
cell types based on um on the coding but

2371
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,639
also what the environment does that's

2372
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,440
the kind of the the goal is you have

2373
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,000
cell types you have you want to see what

2374
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,719
how can you change the line of cell type

2375
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,800
differentiation based on an interplay

2376
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,400
not just like saying you do that and you

2377
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,560
tell the seller to this but based on how

2378
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,440
they interact with each other

2379
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,280
hope to answer your question

2380
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,520
it makes me think of waddington's

2381
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,679
landscape the epigenetic landscape which

2382
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,280
i'll copy in how would you say it

2383
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,360
relates to epigenetics or the epi

2384
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,839
genetically

2385
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,920
also if i have my shirt here i have a

2386
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,760
shirt with it but i i don't see it right

2387
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,920
now yeah i love the uh white instrument

2388
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,080
in it yeah it's exactly um right so that

2389
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,679
that was a the big

2390
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,520
i love you big nap

2391
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,440
i'll put it onto a slide

2392
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,400
yeah

2393
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,639
basically right the whole

2394
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,239
the whole evolution was that initially

2395
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,000
when we started understanding genetic

2396
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,360
information that it was thought well

2397
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,719
that that's that's the end of it now we

2398
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,159
know where to be done here like we know

2399
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,679
basically that there's some certain

2400
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:38,880
signals that will be recessed and then

2401
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,159
you will get certain genes but the thing

2402
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,360
rolls down

2403
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,520
um but basically just from that it's all

2404
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,520
all straightforward what was new then

2405
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,880
later on was the epigenetic part of it

2406
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,920
that was basically actually

2407
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,880
modifications happening not on the

2408
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,480
like you did not notice mutations of the

2409
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,719
genome but which genes were more or less

2410
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,280
accessible for expression

2411
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,199
which you know again so basically you

2412
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,199
kept the coding the same but based on

2413
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,040
modifications a lot of system

2414
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,880
modifications right the the way that the

2415
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,400
chromosomes where the dna is wrapped

2416
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,400
around itself and chromosomes the more

2417
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,080
or less tightly they are equal to each

2418
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,400
other the more less accessible to

2419
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,000
transcription factors

2420
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,639
um and that started basically happening

2421
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,080
later on instead and now we think a lot

2422
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,679
more about this and we even see this

2423
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,760
even that's even heritable

2424
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,880
um and uh it's it's

2425
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,800
it's also interactive with a lot of more

2426
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,960
the physical forces of it so you know

2427
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,960
perturbations in the in the mechanical

2428
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,880
or bilateral environment

2429
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,440
will lead to to a lot faster epigenetic

2430
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,880
transformations of course it's not

2431
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,320
faster it's also important to mention

2432
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,400
that there's a lot faster process it's

2433
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,080
faster to basically

2434
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,239
modify some of the proteins that are

2435
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,679
make up the histones and then make up

2436
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,760
the accessibility of the genetic code

2437
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,280
then to start off going some evolution

2438
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,560
experiment where you start doing

2439
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,159
mutating and cross over until you get

2440
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,520
the right combination so it's a

2441
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,040
different layer

2442
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,199
of information flow that is interactive

2443
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,719
with your negative level

2444
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,000
um so

2445
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,320
what this paper kind of interacts with a

2446
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,840
little bit or you know intersects with

2447
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,880
it is the aspect of of health

2448
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,360
in that initial kind of information

2449
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,639
where you have the same genetic code

2450
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,800
within basically one lifetime

2451
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,719
how do certain

2452
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,280
modifications and in sensory precision

2453
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,440
which you can think of right

2454
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,520
i didn't make that explicit claim

2455
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,280
i i hate to make claims that i'm not

2456
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,199
actually then afterwards answering some

2457
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,679
relevant biological mechanism but i

2458
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,040
could think of easily that way that use

2459
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,239
this these modifications of the the the

2460
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,159
um the response function

2461
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,400
um that the sense the sensitivity

2462
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,239
of the of the double tail experiments

2463
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,199
and the

2464
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,000
mis

2465
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
the reduced sensitivity and the cancer

2466
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
initiation those can easily be thought

2467
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,560
of as as you know short-term epigenetic

2468
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,719
modifications and we do see that a lot

2469
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,159
this happens especially in stress

2470
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,560
environments and embryos and stressful

2471
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,440
environments and beyond genesis

2472
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,600
where where there's very quickly changes

2473
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,120
that can lead to drastic outcomes and

2474
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,719
it's it's thought of as a as a quick

2475
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,880
response mechanism to two basic

2476
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,360
perturbations and and it's involved as

2477
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,960
co of course in cancer as well that's

2478
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,320
that's well known

2479
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,760
so that's kind of how

2480
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,360
i would think about that just the

2481
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,600
landscape here is can be thought of as

2482
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,199
the variation of energy landscape in the

2483
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,120
sense of like what different outcomes

2484
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,520
you can get how how how quickly you

2485
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,280
update your your probabilities based on

2486
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,000
the changes in the environment

2487
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,520
awesome thank you dean

2488
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,840
when i was reading this i i was thinking

2489
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,159
of a

2490
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,760
company that i'm

2491
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,320
invested in that has taken stem cell

2492
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,560
derived isolates

2493
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,520
because people have diabetes and they

2494
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,880
have created

2495
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,120
an environment to protect against the

2496
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,360
perturbation so instead of

2497
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,440
injecting those pancreatic cells

2498
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,440
directly into the portal vein

2499
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,040
they try to

2500
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,360
they have we're working on trying to

2501
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,120
sort of create the environment in which

2502
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,800
the isolates

2503
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,920
survive so it so essentially it's again

2504
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,600
rather than looking

2505
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,840
from the bottom up it's it's sort of

2506
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,360
creating that

2507
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,600
safe environment in which these isolates

2508
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,320
can then carry out their function

2509
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,520
and so that's what i was kind of

2510
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,760
thinking about throughout when i was

2511
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,360
reading your paper now i'm not sure if

2512
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,239
that

2513
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,520
again whether i was thinking of the

2514
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,440
correct analogy but

2515
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,480
but yeah um in terms of what the

2516
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,520
pancreatic isolates can do depends on

2517
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,360
their survivability so if you don't have

2518
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,639
the right kind of

2519
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,400
environment for that um they tend to die

2520
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,280
or

2521
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,120
worse they don't die they become

2522
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,360
cancerous so it's kind of interesting

2523
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,159
that

2524
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,840
you're looking at it here and then i i

2525
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,679
know of some sort of practical

2526
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,280
application but the research is really

2527
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,320
trying to

2528
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,080
build these environments so that they

2529
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,440
can actually protect against the

2530
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,080
perturbations yeah no that's exactly the

2531
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,280
long lines i'm thinking as well

2532
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,320
i do i like two more minutes um if i get

2533
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,639
the knife and go

2534
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:01,520
um

2535
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,080
really appreciated you joining

2536
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,320
if it works for you to drop in or out at

2537
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,400
any point in the dot 2 please feel

2538
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
welcome and any other time you or anyone

2539
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,560
else are welcome to participate but

2540
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,159
thanks a lot for joining

2541
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,679
you're welcome my pleasure

2542
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,520
see you later

2543
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,040
okay

2544
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,000
bye

2545
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,800
bye thank you

2546
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,000
excellent that was great fantastic

2547
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,880
great

2548
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,639
yeah fun times

2549
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,280
um okay so here's here's one thought on

2550
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,960
the relationship with foraging kind of

2551
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,719
picking up on what we were just looking

2552
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:35,440
at

2553
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,320
so

2554
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,040
he described some of the

2555
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,880
manipulations as kind of like

2556
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,920
interventions that were epigenetic so it

2557
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,080
wasn't the addition of

2558
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,360
um

2559
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,199
like another changing the model

2560
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,280
structure like changing their from four

2561
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,440
to five transcription factors

2562
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,400
um

2563
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,080
it was just

2564
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,920
changing their state it's like picking

2565
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,000
one cell up and moving it would be

2566
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,440
changing its position but then there's

2567
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,280
other levers of intervention like

2568
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,120
changing its sensitivity or other

2569
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,800
aspects of its cognitive or its

2570
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,239
generative model

2571
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,480
and the whole point with

2572
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,800
science and active inference

2573
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
though c anticipating brain is not a

2574
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,679
scientist by broonberg's paper so it's

2575
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,440
not exactly the same thing but it's

2576
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,960
about informed

2577
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,000
or directed experimentation

2578
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,840
and that's true from the epistemic

2579
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,320
foraging with the isocating to the

2580
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,600
scientific

2581
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,239
experiment

2582
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,400
when we make targeted interventions into

2583
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,840
systems

2584
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,360
based upon

2585
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,600
a good understanding of them

2586
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,560
we can learn about the cognitive model

2587
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,639
that's underlying it or the as if

2588
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,719
cognitive model so there's a lot of

2589
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,080
interventions that would not be

2590
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,040
informative about morphogenesis like

2591
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,960
jokingly you know hitting the petri dish

2592
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,280
with a hammer it's it's an intervention

2593
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,440
that does kill cells it kills cancer but

2594
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,600
of course isn't that the joke right like

2595
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,760
there needs to be more to it

2596
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,199
in the experimental design and in the

2597
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,440
the measurement of the outcomes so that

2598
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,360
we're actually learning something and so

2599
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,880
to make increasingly nuanced designs

2600
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,880
and learn more and more and apply better

2601
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,000
and better

2602
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,239
that's where having like this kind of

2603
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,639
formal modeling really matters so this

2604
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,120
is kind of taking just saying like well

2605
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,679
changes in receptors might be a

2606
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,000
precursor or a biomarker or an early

2607
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,120
mechanistic warning of x disease

2608
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,639
you'll read that a hundred thousand

2609
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,719
times in the molecular biology

2610
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,840
literature and this is picking up there

2611
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,440
and putting it into a modeling

2612
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,719
architecture

2613
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,800
where we actually can talk about changes

2614
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,880
in signaling and position in an

2615
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,480
integrated way

2616
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,159
so that it might be able to actually

2617
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,159
model real settings just like people use

2618
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,320
the epigenetic landscape heuristically

2619
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,880
but also increasingly quantitatively to

2620
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,360
model selfie decisions but just to kind

2621
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,040
of close that again it's the

2622
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,400
interventions

2623
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,719
that we as the investigator know based

2624
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,080
upon our understanding of like the

2625
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,239
natural history of the system

2626
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,360
that

2627
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,600
give us updates on our cognitive model

2628
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,840
of the system so like an ant foraging

2629
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,400
example is they'll take a desert ant

2630
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,840
that forges

2631
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
alone the decimate goes out without

2632
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,520
following like just simply a pheromone

2633
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,880
trail

2634
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,880
and pick the ant up when it's like let's

2635
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,040
just say 30 meters away from the nest or

2636
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,560
10 20 meters away and then move it to

2637
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,719
like 90 degrees rotated

2638
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,560
the same distance

2639
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,760
so

2640
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,760
one extreme case would be it continues

2641
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,080
from that location a hundred percent as

2642
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,800
if it were walking back from the north

2643
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,239
let's just say

2644
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,639
that would be a pure direction step

2645
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,120
integrator model

2646
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,880
there might be

2647
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,600
an angle it takes between that

2648
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,960
and for example heading towards the nest

2649
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,280
that might reflect the usage of other

2650
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,040
sensory or cognitive features like

2651
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,600
detecting the polarization of light or

2652
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,400
scene memory or other ways that it might

2653
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,560
be able to

2654
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,679
adjust and turn its vector to some other

2655
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:13,360
direction

2656
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,080
so

2657
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,400
that's the kind of experiment where

2658
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,320
we can start to learn like how much are

2659
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,040
the

2660
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,520
nest mates in their foraging adjusting

2661
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,480
between

2662
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,639
their own onboard memory versus these

2663
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,239
external cues that might be picked up

2664
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,639
like in one instance by any nest mate in

2665
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:29,920
that location

2666
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,239
so there's some cells where moving it

2667
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,840
into a different tissue the first thing

2668
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,199
it would do is die

2669
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,880
because it's just like too acidic or

2670
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,040
just like not a good environment for it

2671
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,120
but there are certain interventions that

2672
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,719
do seem to happen

2673
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,800
that lead to at the very least we can

2674
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,639
say states we don't prefer

2675
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,320
or just more directly like states that

2676
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,280
are abnormal or unhealthy

2677
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,800
though it really does come back all to

2678
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,800
blue's question about death

2679
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,400
and aging and

2680
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,639
how is that related and

2681
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,120
what is this living phase between the

2682
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,440
developmental part

2683
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,679
and the death part

2684
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,600
even though there's such a complex

2685
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,719
continuum between them

2686
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,120
stephen

2687
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,880
can i just ask a question on what you're

2688
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,120
just saying there daniel um

2689
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,480
do you feel that or do you think that

2690
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,000
the um

2691
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,040
the the level of what's happening with

2692
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,560
epigenetics is fairly flat

2693
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,159
and it and the once these other types of

2694
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,320
changes these types of changes happen

2695
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,639
that the adjacencies

2696
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:39,120
permeate out and can

2697
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,199
the the cells are kind of finding their

2698
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,400
place

2699
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,520
um

2700
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,280
and is that a bit different to the

2701
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,800
nestedness you know that we're talking

2702
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,320
about the nestedness is

2703
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,840
because um like for instance a tissue

2704
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,920
or is that also

2705
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,400
does it then fall into some other

2706
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,400
type of um

2707
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,239
behavior

2708
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:01,679
where it's like into this idea of the

2709
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,040
nested

2710
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,800
um

2711
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,280
the nested kind of markov blankets

2712
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,679
and is it then a case of

2713
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:11,600
what was

2714
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,000
the types of information flows which

2715
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,080
were conservation at one scale

2716
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,159
have become noise

2717
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,920
that makes sense so maybe

2718
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,000
i'm just curious about

2719
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,040
if that

2720
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,159
is in here

2721
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:29,600
um

2722
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,320
it very well might i mean what it just

2723
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,440
makes me think about is the eye

2724
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,440
specification in

2725
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,600
fruit flies and and similar in other

2726
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,000
insects so this is like an example of a

2727
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,679
developmental genetics pathway

2728
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:45,920
at a relatively downstream level being

2729
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,119
worked out

2730
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,719
through a lot of work

2731
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,920
but these cells are pre-committed

2732
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,280
to being eye precursor cells but then

2733
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,520
they undergo a second

2734
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,320
or a future stage of differentiation

2735
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,880
that results in a compound i and then

2736
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,480
it's the modularity of this

2737
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,840
developmental

2738
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,159
framing of first i precursor cell and

2739
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,400
then to a specified eye compound

2740
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,280
cell

2741
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,360
that lets like the insect eye scale in

2742
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,880
different ways for example than the

2743
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,520
mammal eye developmentally so over

2744
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,800
evolutionary time there's different

2745
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,679
affordances for insect eye evolution

2746
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,920
versus mammalian cell eye evolution um

2747
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,920
because they're on different pathways

2748
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,719
so

2749
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,960
it's kind of fractal because

2750
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,840
this

2751
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,480
eye field precursor it's not

2752
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,760
the second one that comes out of the

2753
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,520
embryo so

2754
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,960
there's multiple

2755
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,400
like fractal

2756
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,400
layers and pre-committals

2757
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,760
and it's not possible to jump from a

2758
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,840
canyon way at the bottom

2759
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,639
directly over there's a few cancers cell

2760
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,400
papers that do a little bit more of like

2761
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,159
a reversion and around or a perturbation

2762
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,520
that pushes

2763
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,520
and then changes to like susceptibility

2764
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,040
or kind of like changes in the elevation

2765
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,480
of these hills between

2766
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,159
so it's a landscape

2767
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,840
which isn't just simply flat

2768
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,239
um it has some scale

2769
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,199
and then

2770
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,320
the

2771
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,760
relationship between how jagged it is

2772
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,199
and how much

2773
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,280
noise or flow

2774
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,520
there is is about how navigable that

2775
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,600
landscape is

2776
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,639
in that one model

2777
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,880
blue

2778
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,080
so i have a question for

2779
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,880
daniel and dean specifically um so when

2780
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,159
franz was here he talked about the block

2781
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,840
matrix operator that he used in equation

2782
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,679
39

2783
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,480
and you guys well maybe it was daniel

2784
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,639
specifically we're talking about some

2785
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:51,119
kind of housekeeping term in the dot

2786
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,119
zero and i couldn't remember or place

2787
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,040
the housekeeping term that you were

2788
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,800
referring to and i wondered if it was

2789
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,520
like the same or similar in a similar or

2790
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,360
used in a similar way

2791
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,159
i think it's connor i'll bring in a

2792
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,600
housekeeping

2793
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,800
term slide it was from 32

2794
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,679
live stream 32 stochastic chaos markov

2795
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,040
blankets

2796
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:13,700
and um

2797
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,119
[Music]

2798
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,040
here

2799
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,320
is the slide in slide 45 here

2800
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,159
yeah

2801
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,600
it was um

2802
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,639
basically

2803
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,960
the helmholtz decomposition

2804
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,159
is

2805
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:29,600
usually discussed in terms of just the

2806
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,679
gradient the solenoidal so sort of like

2807
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,119
directed

2808
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,040
term and then the iso contour

2809
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,280
circulation change in elevation ruler on

2810
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,360
the hill and then around the hill on the

2811
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,880
isocontour

2812
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,000
and then

2813
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,199
this paper

2814
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,360
32

2815
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,320
brought in the housekeeping term

2816
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,679
and then there was like a supplement so

2817
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,159
we didn't really totally go into it but

2818
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,280
together

2819
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,600
um they represent the total flow so it's

2820
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,119
a slight kind of

2821
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,440
um fristen variation on the helmholtz

2822
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,719
decomposition

2823
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,280
in this context but as conor mentioned

2824
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,960
in 32.3

2825
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,960
it also has like sort of antecedents and

2826
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,840
maybe even similarities with other areas

2827
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,360
so totally remains to be a little bit

2828
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,239
unpacked but it's the influence of how

2829
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,199
movement changes the landscape

2830
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,719
at least that's a little bit how we were

2831
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,800
framing it like change on a trampoline

2832
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,800
where the movement is going to influence

2833
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,119
it you can't just snapshot the landscape

2834
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,040
and then calculate what would happen and

2835
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,400
what the gradient and the solenoidal

2836
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,000
flow would be at every point because

2837
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,760
it's going to be the future

2838
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,600
well that might be related to what franz

2839
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,360
was saying because he said he used it to

2840
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
smooth out the landscape because

2841
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,800
otherwise you get stuck in like a little

2842
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,400
local pocket when you're talking about

2843
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,320
like you know something that that's

2844
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,719
bumpy so it sounds like it could be a

2845
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,000
similar type of um like housekeeping

2846
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,159
thing or just like a smoothing

2847
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,600
smoothiness when you're when you're

2848
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,119
going into the bowl you don't want to

2849
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,360
get stuck in a bump down along the way

2850
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,920
right if you're a marble traveling down

2851
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,620
like i thought it was a cleanse

2852
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:04,400
[Laughter]

2853
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,159
there's just too many too many jokes to

2854
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:09,199
be made um but

2855
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:10,960
um

2856
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,600
wow i think in our last you know

2857
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,560
ten ish minutes we should just chill

2858
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,639
land the plane prepare for dot two it

2859
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,080
was pretty unexpected and awesome

2860
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,080
to have the um

2861
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,800
time that we got to speak and i think

2862
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,560
that's like the housekeeping term in

2863
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,679
action

2864
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,239
which is a process and a protocol

2865
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,239
and then people who have different

2866
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:36,320
perspectives on a situation but the

2867
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,440
group

2868
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,520
can always re-adapt to a changing

2869
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,199
landscape and so even if that's

2870
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:42,880
interpreted as structure learning at a

2871
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,239
higher level

2872
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,080
from the sort of

2873
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,239
agent view looking up

2874
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:50,000
it's equivalent to adapting to a

2875
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,400
different situation in some fractal way

2876
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,719
slightly different or very different

2877
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,960
using the same affordances and

2878
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,679
perceptive and cognitive features as it

2879
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,920
had in the time step before

2880
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,360
and that's why

2881
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,639
um

2882
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:05,600
this

2883
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,560
model

2884
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,600
that looks at the flow of the autonomous

2885
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,199
states

2886
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,360
so um the states that can actually be

2887
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,199
controlled in the markov blanket

2888
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,199
partition

2889
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,040
in 30

2890
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,440
by defining a specific function that we

2891
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:27,679
want to like be fitting well

2892
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:30,560
by really focusing on the flow over the

2893
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,760
blanket and internal states

2894
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,040
it allows inference on that component

2895
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,360
perception cognition and action

2896
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,840
of the given modeled entity

2897
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
to be

2898
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,719
uncoupled in a certain way from

2899
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,159
inference on

2900
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,600
the hidden external state evolution

2901
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
which is fundamentally unknowable but in

2902
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,560
a slightly different way

2903
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,840
if that makes any sense

2904
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,400
and a classic moment blue to suggest the

2905
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,119
the

2906
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,360
mitotic elements

2907
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,760
and like

2908
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,000
just to bring in the continuity and then

2909
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
the way that that gives rise to symmetry

2910
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,719
breaking sort of for free

2911
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,610
um and that this or and

2912
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:25,360
[Music]

2913
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,520
so it's

2914
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,159
cool conversation that we had today and

2915
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:31,119
so

2916
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:34,000
so i ended up as a dot one might

2917
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,520
i didn't get to mention that i was gonna

2918
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,679
mention it um but like you know

2919
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,600
there's that fractal

2920
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,560
fmri brain pattern paper that i'm like

2921
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,239
dying to read and

2922
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,080
would love to discuss with the authors

2923
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,040
also

2924
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,040
but it's interesting just in terms of

2925
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,440
the the fractal dimension also that

2926
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,280
franz was talking about is super cool

2927
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,639
um

2928
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:00,000
is there anything else that we want to

2929
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,280
like

2930
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,599
um

2931
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,239
write down to think about in the dot two

2932
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,000
or questions that we would like to ask

2933
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,239
franz if he returns or just things that

2934
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,638
we want to

2935
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,520
take moving forward in the dot 2 already

2936
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,560
yeah i i agree it's like it's like

2937
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,840
you're eating dinner it's like when you

2938
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,639
want dinner tomorrow

2939
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,040
inverting space and time we didn't

2940
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,119
really get to um and some of these

2941
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,440
initial points it was

2942
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,719
right at least action math and

2943
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,560
morphology and then

2944
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,400
generalized flow and taking us all the

2945
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,960
way back dean so i i would like to maybe

2946
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,520
ask ask friends about quantum mechanics

2947
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,719
and what

2948
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,560
role if any that that played in um

2949
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,719
like what is there a quantum perspective

2950
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,320
that that he was

2951
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,880
perhaps viewing in from

2952
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,639
um when he was writing this paper i

2953
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,040
would i would like to ask just that one

2954
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,520
question because that will encompass

2955
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,440
inverting space and time and it will

2956
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,480
encompass

2957
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,360
what we're talking about with the

2958
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,119
probability current

2959
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,520
and um the probability mass conservation

2960
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,480
so like that all is like bridging into

2961
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,560
the quantum where we'll go in the 40. so

2962
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,320
i think i would like to ask about that

2963
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,159
one thing

2964
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,760
dean what are you like looking forward

2965
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,360
to or would you want to add here at the

2966
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,560
end

2967
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,080
i'm just going to go back to the drawing

2968
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,320
board and basically look look a little

2969
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,639
more closely at some of those math

2970
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,560
operations because i don't tend to give

2971
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,880
those as much attention as i need to i

2972
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,040
think it's really interesting uh

2973
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,400
now that we've

2974
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,320
had a chance to sort of

2975
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,239
bring more people into the conversation

2976
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,080
i think

2977
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,960
of there's three parts to i think we can

2978
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,960
agree there are three

2979
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,880
things that we can really center on now

2980
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,159
there's the

2981
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:59,360
the formally form forming which is what

2982
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,199
figure four and five do

2983
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,040
but as soon as you go to figure five

2984
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,119
what's interesting is is that the

2985
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,920
the attention seems to be on the shape

2986
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,280
that the

2987
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,000
cells eventually take and yet in the in

2988
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,400
the sort of in the blackness around each

2989
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,440
one of those moment captures

2990
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,480
there's

2991
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,040
there's signaling and there's changing

2992
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,880
right there's so there's all the part

2993
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,159
we've talked about today which is the

2994
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,480
whole flowing piece and what where is it

2995
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,400
going and how is it channeling and how

2996
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,639
is it narrowing or how is it spreading

2997
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,239
and how is it dissipating and all that

2998
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:33,600
stuff

2999
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,600
but in those even in those diagrams it's

3000
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,119
hard to figure out

3001
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,480
where the signal is even when they

3002
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,080
introduce arrows

3003
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,040
they introduce the arrow pointing at

3004
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,719
the form

3005
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:45,679
not

3006
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,840
the necessarily the signaling and the

3007
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,600
changing and that's where the math

3008
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,760
really comes in i think because

3009
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,639
without the math you you lose sight of

3010
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:56,239
those other two

3011
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,440
present

3012
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,440
factors that are you know

3013
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,320
all

3014
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,119
moving and mixing and and turning into

3015
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,320
something

3016
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,199
so

3017
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,560
i hope

3018
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,560
france comes back because

3019
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,520
man he's got a heck of a lot more um

3020
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,520
he's got a lot more to tell us about

3021
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,600
really because this is such a dense

3022
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,360
paper like i think i mentioned to you

3023
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,440
daniel before before the point zero this

3024
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,600
could be a 13 week course this one paper

3025
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,719
if you really

3026
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,800
wanted to i don't know how many hours he

3027
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,880
spent on this but he already admitted

3028
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,679
that going to carl's lab and and

3029
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,000
and from the lab he's at there's way

3030
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,960
more multiples of ten thousand hours of

3031
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,040
work that we're done before he

3032
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,679
started typing things out so

3033
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,760
yeah

3034
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,520
awesome what that

3035
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,000
made me like think about is this idea of

3036
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,719
like multiple kinds of invisibility or

3037
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,080
overlay

3038
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,440
or unpacking like projection up into a

3039
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,000
bigger dimension of interpretation

3040
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,840
like you pointed out how the sig like

3041
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,639
the focus was on morphology which is to

3042
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,280
say the final realize like this picture

3043
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,320
is of the morphology of the animal it's

3044
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,360
not of the signaling density but this

3045
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,119
could be like presented as just a

3046
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:13,760
gradient of transcription factor a

3047
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,440
or it could be presented as a gradient

3048
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,800
of vitamin a

3049
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,480
or like it's kind of like krillian

3050
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,760
photography

3051
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,159
like looking at the morphology with the

3052
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,520
energy field i don't know if that's

3053
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,159
exactly what it is but that sort of idea

3054
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:29,360
with the the field based perspective

3055
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,360
but then it gets hard to show

3056
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,040
many overlaying

3057
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,560
fields

3058
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,400
because like what do you do 20

3059
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,400
overlaying colors but we we can't

3060
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,119
actually see that and so that's just

3061
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,800
kind of interesting like a question

3062
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,159
about visualization of higher

3063
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,600
dimensional models with a lot of

3064
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,679
overlays and then

3065
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,199
that's like one kind of invisibility

3066
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:50,719
which is something that's modeled but

3067
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:53,840
just not graphically shown easily like

3068
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,080
the density of 50 pheromones or 50

3069
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,400
transcription factors or vitamins

3070
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,639
but then also but but it does exist and

3071
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,040
it's like modeled as an actual chemical

3072
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,880
component of the biological system like

3073
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,960
the generative process

3074
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,000
and then

3075
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
there's this generative model with the

3076
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,639
mathematical derivatives

3077
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,880
the generalized coordinates of motion of

3078
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,119
cellular position and those are also

3079
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,520
like invisible in a different way

3080
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,960
because they're

3081
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,760
um

3082
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,920
a modeling

3083
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,119
tool

3084
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,960
and the derivatives are not anywhere in

3085
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,000
reality like what is where's the seventh

3086
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,400
derivative of the baseball's movement

3087
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,199
just

3088
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,199
relative to what where is it hiding in

3089
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,960
the current moment

3090
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,040
this is just a purely

3091
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,280
tool-driven way of thinking about the

3092
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,239
current moment not just in terms of its

3093
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,719
composition and like anatomy

3094
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,639
and position and the lowest level of the

3095
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,159
observed model but like these higher

3096
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,600
levels which are

3097
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,960
real yet

3098
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,440
not existing in the moment

3099
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,040
structurally real

3100
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,080
in the

3101
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,719
structural realism sense i'll take your

3102
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,159
word for it

3103
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:03,920
i've been wanting to say that for a long

3104
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,000
time

3105
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,080
i have to now go back and figure it out

3106
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,960
so

3107
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,760
um but

3108
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,159
but uh discussion i hope like for those

3109
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:17,760
who stick around to the end here that

3110
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,679
they enjoyed this that this wasn't just

3111
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,000
um

3112
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,480
total uh

3113
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,520
total

3114
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,320
morpho apostrophe

3115
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,800
all right well

3116
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,639
fun times and awesome to have all the

3117
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:39,920
good discussions and appreciate

3118
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,119
everybody who

3119
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:43,840
was here blue and steven and dean so see

3120
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,719
you all next week or any other time

3121
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:48,080
peace

3122
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,800
bye thank you

3123
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,719
you
