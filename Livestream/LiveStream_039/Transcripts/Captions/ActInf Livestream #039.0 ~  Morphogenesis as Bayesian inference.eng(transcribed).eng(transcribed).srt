3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,960
all right hello and welcome everyone to

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,680
active lab live stream number 39.0

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,160
it's february 25th 2022

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
welcome to the active lab we are a

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
at the links here on the slide

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
this is a recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
feedback so we can improve our work

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
welcome and we'll be following good

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,440
video etiquette for live streams

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
if you want to learn more about

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
coms which is the organizational unit

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
that puts on all these live streams and

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
many other products or any of the other

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,799
activities in the active lab go to

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,799
activeinference.org

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
all right well

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,920
today in active stream number 39.0 the

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
goal is to learn and discuss

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
this really awesome paper called

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
morphogenesis as bayesian inference

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
a variational approach to pattern

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
formation and control in complex

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,720
biological systems it's by franz

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
koochling carl firsten georgiegiv and

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
michael levin from 2020

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,399
and just like all the dot zero videos

34
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,119
and indeed all our videos it's just an

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
introduction to some of these ideas it's

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,720
not a review

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
or a final word

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
that being said we're going to go over

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
the aims claims abstract roadmap keyword

40
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,520
etc of the paper and then

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,239
with a focus on the first parts of the

42
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,639
paper and less so on the formalism and

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,480
more on the big ideas we're going to go

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
over the paper and the figures

45
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
and that will put us in a good position

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
cognitively or morphologically we might

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
even say for

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,319
the discussions in the coming weeks 39.1

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,080
and 39.2

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
when we'll get to unpack this so if you

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
would like to it'd be awesome to have

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
you participate live or if it's past

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
39.2 you can still ask questions

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
all right we'll start with introductions

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
and warm-ups

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
we can each

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,680
say hi and maybe one thing that was

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
exciting or interesting about the paper

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,640
which all reserved for after you but i'm

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
daniel i'm a researcher in california

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,040
and dean thanks a ton for joining

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,440
uh thanks natalie i'm dean i'm here in

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
calgary

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,519
and

65
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
what really got me excited about this

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,640
was

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
uh the idea that they talk a little bit

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
later close to the end we may not even

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
talk about it today is

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,120
the uh role that epigenetics might play

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
in terms of how cells behave and

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
and what sorts of things we might be

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
able to turn turn in terms of

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
simply um what we see in biological form

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
into some sort of static

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
statistical prediction device so i'm

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
really excited about that awesome

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,879
yeah

79
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,400
it's a

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
complex paper about complex systems so

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
we'll see what we can get done today but

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,799
i'm really excited to bring

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
active inference into

84
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,599
this domain at least as far as our

85
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
discussions go into the morphological

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
and the morphogenetic areas

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
and it's just bringing like another

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
lens another way that we can apply

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
active inference as a filter

90
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
another set of phenomena that we're

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
bringing into

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
this active inference

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,599
realm

94
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,080
so we'll just go right into the big

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
question so i'll read this and then feel

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
free to give a thought

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
the big question or at least one way to

98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
put one of the questions is how can we

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
find an integrative path between math

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,960
and morphogenesis morphogenesis means

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
form

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
like physical form morpho and genesis

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,400
meaning how it arises so how does

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
physical form arise and how is that

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
related to math

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
and to kind of unpack that here's some

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
quotes

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
the molecular mechanisms

109
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
which are like signaling pathways of all

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
different kinds

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
underlying development and regeneration

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
in biological organisms

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360
have undergone a tremendous amount of

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
knowledge gain in the last several years

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,360
due to genomics and biotechnology

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
advances

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
so that's kind of the

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
one side with the biological and then

119
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
from the mathematical and the formal the

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
emerging field of the free energy

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
principle in pattern formation

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
not always morphogenetic patterns but

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
can be cognitive patterns rhythmic

124
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,120
patterns

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
provides an essential quantitative

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
formalism for understanding cellular

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
decision making in the context of

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
embryogenesis regeneration and cancer

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
suppression

130
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,440
so if that's the if

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,639
then

132
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
how might the mathematical formalism

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
reveal new understandings about

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,320
developmental change in evolution

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
and for designing new interventions in

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,759
regenerative medicine settings so what

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,720
do you think about that

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,000
well i just love anytime that two things

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
that seem disparate or distant are are

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
brought together because i think all

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
sorts of good things can happen and i'm

142
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
going to do a little shout out that's

143
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
kind of what i would like to

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
see if we can organize in august with a

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
couple of other papers that don't start

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,560
out necessarily appearing to be

147
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
close or proximal but by bringing

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,560
together all kinds of interesting things

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,400
can happen

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
awesome

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
okay

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
to the main aims and claims of the paper

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,319
so the paper is in physics of life

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
reviews 2020 and we already mentioned

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
the title and the authors

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,479
just to select a few aims that the

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,800
authors represent and then a couple of

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
key claims that are relevant for the

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
paper

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
so as far as aims go one of their aims

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
is to introduce an overarching concept

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
that can predict the emergence of form

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,800
and the robust maintenance of complex

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
anatomy

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
another aim is to

166
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,039
derive the mathematics behind bayesian

167
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
inference and use simulations to show

168
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,039
simulations that are consistent and

169
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
within the bayesian framework to show

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
that the formalism can reproduce

171
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
experimental top-down manipulations of

172
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,319
complex morphogenesis

173
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
and then just a few of their claims more

174
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
of which we'll be unpacking in the

175
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
coming minutes

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,599
classic

177
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
i.e dynamical systems and analytical

178
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
mechanics

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,759
approaches such as last at least action

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,960
principles

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,039
are difficult to use when characterizing

182
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
open far from equilibrium systems that

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
predominate in biology so that's kind of

184
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,000
a big challenge that's come up again and

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
again which is we might have really

186
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,479
great equations for a pendulum maybe

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
even a pendulum with friction but how

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
about an active pendulum that's doing

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
strategy and trying to run away from you

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
a bit harder to put those same equations

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,919
on

192
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
the bayesian inference framework treats

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
cells as

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,080
information processing agents

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
where the driving force behind

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
morphogenesis is the maximization of a

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
cell's model evidence

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
which is to say its reduction of

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
uncertainty relative to a generative

200
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
model which is what we're going to be

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
unpacking

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
and

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,160
we had previously read this

204
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
about how they're applying free energy

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,039
principle to morphogenesis

206
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
when it goes well

207
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
like during embryogenesis

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,319
and results in a zygote becoming like an

209
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
adult life form as well as all of the

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
ways that it's maintained during that

211
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
stationarity of healthy life and

212
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,000
including cases where it might be

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,759
relevant to even think about making

214
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
interventions like medical settings

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
so those are a few of the aims and

216
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,719
claims

217
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
anything to add on it

218
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
yeah just real quick it's really

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
interesting that they said top down and

220
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
then we're going to see some

221
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,120
slides where there's a top top

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
and

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
a down down so

224
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
stick around

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
because there's actually going to be

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
something kind of interesting happening

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
here

228
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
okay

229
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
how about you read the first half of the

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
um the top half of this abstract slide

231
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
yeah sure recent advances in molecular

232
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
biology such as gene editing bioelectric

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
recording and manipulation and live cell

234
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,920
microsc

235
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,560
microscopy

236
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
using fluorescent reporters especially

237
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,360
with the advent of light controlled

238
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
protein activation through optogenetics

239
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
have provided the tools to measure and

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
manipulate molecular signaling pathways

241
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
with unprecedented spatial temporal

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
precision this has produced

243
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
ever-increasing detail about the

244
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
molecular mechanisms underlying

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
development and regeneration bought in

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
biological organisms however

247
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
an overarching concept

248
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
that can predict the emergence

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
of form and the robust maintenance of

250
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
complex anatomy is largely missing in

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
the field

252
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
classic

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
i.e dynamic systems and analytical

254
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,560
mechanics approaches such

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
at least action as least action

256
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
principles are difficult to use when

257
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
characterizing open

258
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
far from equilibrium systems that

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
predominate in biology similar issues

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,519
arise in neuroscience when trying to

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
understand neuronal dynamics from first

262
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
principles so they're basically covering

263
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,200
their

264
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
bases here by making sure that we

265
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
understand this is open

266
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
system

267
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,000
yes

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,720
increases in tools

269
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
in biological systems like genomics

270
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
microscopy optogenetics are helping us

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
reduce our uncertainty about the what

272
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,800
but without

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
a bit more information about the how and

274
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,440
the why etc that's the overarching

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
concept that's largely missing

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
so we can grind up the cells and

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
sequence the genome we can extract the

278
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
rna and we can even tell what the ratio

279
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
of different rna molecules is but it

280
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
turns out that that type of information

281
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
alone

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
doesn't help us understand why two

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,680
related species or the same species in

284
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
two different contexts or the same

285
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
genome in two different tissues or the

286
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
same tissue in two different

287
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
environments has such different

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
morphology

289
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,519
okay

290
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
and then the second half in this

291
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
neurobiology setting a variational free

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
energy principle has emerged based upon

293
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
a formulation of self-organization in

294
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
terms of active bayesian inference

295
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,079
the free energy principle has recently

296
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,399
been applied to biological

297
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,040
self-organization beyond the

298
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,640
neurosciences

299
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
for biological processes that underwrite

300
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
development or regeneration

301
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
the bayesian inference framework treats

302
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
cells as information processing agents

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
where the driving force behind

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
morphogenesis is the maximization of a

305
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
cell's model evidence

306
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
this is realized by the appropriate

307
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
expression of receptors and other

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
signals that correspond to the cell's

309
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,399
internal ie generative

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
model of what type of receptors and

311
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
other signals it should express

312
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
the emerging field of the free energy

313
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,399
principle in pattern formation provides

314
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,480
an essential quantitative formalism for

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
understanding cellular decision making

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
in the context of embryogenesis

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,519
regeneration and cancer suppression

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,760
okay and then if you read the first

319
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
um two parts here on the second slide

320
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,480
yeah no problem in this paper we derive

321
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
the mathematics behind

322
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
bayesian inference as understood in this

323
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
framework and use simulations to show

324
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
that formalism can reproduce

325
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
interesting experimental top-down

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
manipulations of complex morphogenesis

327
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
first we illustrate the first principle

328
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
approach to morphogenesis through

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
simulated alterations of anterior

330
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
posterior

331
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
axial polarity

332
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
the induction of two heads or two tails

333
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
ah spoiler alert as a planarian

334
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
regeneration

335
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,519
don't you hate it when the abstract

336
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,399
spoils the paper

337
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
then we consider aberrant signaling and

338
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
functional behavior of a single cell

339
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,680
within a cellular ensemble as a first

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
step in carcinogenesis the formation of

341
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
cancer

342
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,399
as false beliefs about what a cell

343
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
should sense and do

344
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
inference perception action inference

345
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
we further show that simple

346
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
modifications of the inference process

347
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
can cause

348
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
and rescue

349
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
mispatterning of developmental and

350
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
regenerative events without changing the

351
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
implicit generative model of a cell as

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
specified for example

353
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
by its dna

354
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
this formalism offers a new roadmap

355
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
for understanding developmental change

356
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,959
in evolution and for designing new

357
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
interventions in regenerative medicine

358
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
settings

359
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
speaking of the new roadmap

360
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
let's look at the roadmap

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
kind of cool that they actually

362
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
say that it is

363
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
providing a road map so we've talked

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
about guides

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,079
we've talked about road maps where do

366
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,760
you see all of that before we look at

367
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
the section titles

368
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
well

369
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,160
a guide i think

370
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
basically gives

371
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
sort of gives you um

372
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
the parameters i think a roadmap is a

373
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
lot more specific in terms of the

374
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
sequencing but that's just my

375
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
interpretation of it i think

376
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
other people can interpret roadmap

377
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
roadmap differently in terms of sort of

378
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
the relational aspect of how the

379
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,399
different parts come together and we've

380
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
talked about that in other live streams

381
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,880
but

382
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,240
i don't want to get bogged down in this

383
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
part right now because

384
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,120
i think we got a lot of stuff to cover

385
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,240
here

386
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,279
cool yeah so the paper begins with an

387
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
introduction to bayesian inference

388
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,560
section 2 is mathematical foundations

389
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
that are building on bayesian inference

390
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
so going from kind of bayes theorem to

391
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,399
several dynamical systems

392
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,160
representations some of which we've

393
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
discussed before others which will push

394
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
it into a little bit of a new area

395
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,079
then

396
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
the key

397
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,199
contribution and the focus of the paper

398
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,600
is modeling morphogenesis

399
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,399
and so instead of just presenting bays

400
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
and then variational bays and then free

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
energy minimization on

402
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,000
a bacterium like we saw axle constant do

403
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,560
in live stream number 34

404
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
we're going to take that

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
momentum

406
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,880
and move it towards an application of

407
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
modeling in morphogenesis

408
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
and that's where we'll talk about like

409
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,519
what model they construct and how it

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
relates to some of the formalisms that

411
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
were brought up earlier

412
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,839
and then

413
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,440
there's a discussion and conclusion

414
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
section which we won't go too much into

415
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
today in the dot zero but it's going to

416
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
be awesome to go into it in the dot one

417
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,040
and dot two

418
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
because there's a ton of awesome

419
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
content and material

420
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,600
all right

421
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
so here's the keywords that were listed

422
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,290
and we won't go into um

423
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,519
[Music]

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
most of them

425
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
just to say that they're going to come

426
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
up in this discussion we have free

427
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
energy principle bayesian inference

428
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
morphogenesis and developmental biology

429
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
regeneration

430
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,079
kind of got some mathematical stuff

431
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,360
we've seen before

432
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,519
we have a triad

433
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,639
of

434
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,880
developmental biology which broadly

435
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,079
understood includes embryogenesis as

436
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,199
well as

437
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
aging and cancer and all these other

438
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
developmental things that happened

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,360
during biology and top-down muddling and

440
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
maybe we'll see what that means coming

441
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,199
up

442
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,880
okay well to get right into it

443
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
section one is an introduction to

444
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
bayesian inference

445
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,880
so

446
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
here's a nice picture by sasha

447
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
and here are the opening lines of the

448
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
paper

449
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
they wrote and then feel free to give a

450
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
thought

451
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
evolutionary change results from

452
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,199
mutations in dna and selection acting on

453
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
functional bodies

454
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,039
thus it is essential to understand how

455
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,679
the hardware encoded by the genome

456
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,599
enables the behavioral plasticity of

457
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,079
cells that can cooperate to build and

458
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,799
repair complex anatomies

459
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
indeed most problems of biomedicine

460
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
repair of birth defects regeneration of

461
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,559
traumatic injury tumor reprogramming etc

462
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,160
could be addressed if prediction and

463
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
control could be gained over the

464
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
processes by which cells implement

465
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,799
dynamic pattern homeostasis

466
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
the fundamental knowledge gap and

467
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,480
opportunity of the next decades in the

468
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
biosciences

469
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
is to complement bottom-up molecular

470
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
understanding of mechanisms

471
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,919
with a top-down computational theory of

472
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,880
cellular decision making and info taxes

473
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,840
movements towards information

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,799
so

475
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,720
dean what do you think

476
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
what should we study and why and how is

477
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
this related to active and fep

478
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
okay well my background in genetics is

479
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
is near zero but what i did come away

480
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
from with that last bullet in particular

481
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,679
was

482
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
uh some one of the things that i

483
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
beat like a dead animal which is that

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
you need a minimum of two and i think

485
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
that the

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,280
the bottom up sort of building blocks

487
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,080
aspect of it with the top down how do we

488
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
get a better grip on what the signals

489
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
are that are passing between

490
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
all of those bricks um was really

491
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
interesting and so

492
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
carrying on through

493
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
i i kind of wanted to open that up and

494
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
see what that um that marriage looked

495
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
like

496
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
awesome

497
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,280
so speaking as someone who started in

498
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
the science journey with genetics pretty

499
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
much

500
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
it always was so interesting how

501
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
genetics would frame itself as if the

502
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
bottom-up information flow could just

503
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
simply replace theory we'll sequence so

504
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,720
many genomes we won't need to speculate

505
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
about evolution or we'll have your

506
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
genome so we won't even need to ask

507
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,799
about what medicine is best

508
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,720
and that's kind of this bottom-up

509
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,200
molecular understanding which is vital

510
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
it's essential it's important it's

511
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
changing a lot

512
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
but it's this bottom-up

513
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
sub-unit description

514
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
the what and the where of the subunits

515
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,919
and how they touch and all of that

516
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
and that is always met implicitly and

517
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
increasingly explicitly with a top-down

518
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,679
theory of cellular decision-making and

519
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
infotaxes and so we're always kind of

520
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
meeting in the middle with empirical wet

521
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,440
lab biology revealing these mechanisms

522
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
and these findings

523
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
and we're meeting that as researchers

524
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
doing model-based science with what are

525
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
being called here top-down modeling

526
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,280
top-down computational theories

527
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
okay that's just how they open up and

528
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
also set a challenge for the coming

529
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,200
decades

530
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,679
it's their expectation of the next few

531
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
decades

532
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,039
then they provide a math roadmap

533
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,600
which is an awesome paragraph

534
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
so they write we lay out the

535
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
mathematical foundations of a type of

536
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,720
bayesian modeling

537
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
that they're going to use to simulate

538
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
pattern formation

539
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,039
so red bayesian modeling

540
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
orange we start by identifying a

541
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
lyapunov function

542
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
that can be used to analyze and solve

543
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
any dynamic system using the fundamental

544
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
theorem of vector calculus i.e the

545
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
helmholtz decomposition

546
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
so we're using bayesian modeling and

547
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
layering in what we'll talk about soon

548
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
the leopard function

549
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,039
green we use it to characterize the

550
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,919
generalized flow of systemic states

551
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,080
states of the whole system in terms of

552
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
conversions to a non-equilibrium steady

553
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,200
state a ness

554
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
next layer blue

555
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
we then introduce the notion of a markov

556
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
blanket that separates the external and

557
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
internal states of the system

558
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
and finally purple

559
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,240
we can then replace the leopard function

560
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,200
with a variational free energy function

561
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
to solve for the evolution of internal

562
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
and active states

563
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,919
that's

564
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
of the particle

565
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
and thereby characterize

566
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
self-organization in far from

567
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
equilibrium systems that can be

568
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,200
partitioned into a cell

569
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
and an external milieu

570
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
that's the math that they go through

571
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,039
that's the math rainbow then

572
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
sections after that

573
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
apply this formalism to illustrate

574
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,640
morphogenesis and neoplasia which is the

575
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,360
growth of new forms neoplasia

576
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
using simulations

577
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,120
and what's so cool is this

578
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,760
trajectory

579
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
from 400 to 700 nanometers

580
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
from the bays

581
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
through the vector calculus and flow

582
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
states

583
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,520
to the finding or the figuring out of a

584
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
markov blanket

585
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,039
and then

586
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,000
the usage of the markov partitioning

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
legitimated

588
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
by the orange and the green steps

589
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,840
to find a heuristic way to go about

590
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
solving

591
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
what was

592
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
needing to be addressed right in the

593
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,440
beginning

594
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
we've seen some variants of this

595
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
trajectory multiple times

596
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,960
and then

597
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,440
in this paper they studied morphogenesis

598
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,559
and so then they model morphogenesis but

599
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,120
say for a couple of words

600
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,039
a different paper could have said we do

601
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,280
the base thing the lyapunov thing the

602
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,400
helmholtz

603
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
the nest the markov and then we're back

604
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
to doing far from equilibrium

605
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,799
strategy in

606
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
online teams

607
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,960
and then we applied it to online teams

608
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,919
and so

609
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,760
let's keep in mind like the paper can be

610
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,159
long there are a lot of equations but

611
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,200
where is this broader trajectory that's

612
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,360
helping us fine-tune our regime of

613
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
attention and update our generative

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,039
model about what we are doing here and

615
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,280
how it's different than other approaches

616
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
and then where is the part that's

617
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,039
actually studying morphogenesis

618
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
just things to keep in mind okay

619
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,320
anything to add on this

620
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
well you

621
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
correct me if i'm wrong on this but i

622
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
think what we're doing is

623
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,480
essentially

624
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
taking

625
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
as you said we can we can look at a

626
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,799
variety of things we can look at

627
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
the physical nature of ants we can look

628
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,559
at cells we can look at

629
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,080
online teams

630
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
whatever we're looking at what they

631
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,120
basically said is

632
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
there is a there is a parallel

633
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
way of looking at the formalisms

634
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,159
that exist in those contexts with that

635
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,279
with that

636
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,799
type of content

637
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,039
that's essentially what this said to me

638
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,679
there's a way of bumping it up into that

639
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
sort of statistical mathematical realm

640
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
and now we're going to walk you through

641
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
what that is

642
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,480
great

643
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
okay so into

644
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
the bay

645
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,960
the bay's area where i grew up

646
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
so

647
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,640
sitting by the dock of the base all

648
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
right oh i thought so i'm gonna say

649
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
where the water well where the

650
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
watermelons grow carry on

651
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
base theorem rests on three basic axioms

652
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
of probability theory and is used to

653
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,440
relate

654
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
the conditional probability of an

655
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,400
unobservable event a okay so the

656
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,799
vertical bar means conditioned upon or

657
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,840
given

658
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
and so what we really want to know is

659
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,440
like the probability of something that

660
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
we cannot observe

661
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,960
conditioned on what we did observe be

662
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
so you're never observing the lightning

663
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
strike you're observing photons on your

664
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,760
receptor and then you want to know about

665
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
whether there was lightning in that

666
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,559
cloud over a few miles away so we want

667
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
to know the conditional probability of

668
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,440
an unobservable event a that's this left

669
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,840
hand side

670
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
we want to relate that to

671
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,640
an observable quantity b

672
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
that's what the data are

673
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
and that's going to be calculated using

674
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
the bayes theorem as

675
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
the probability of the data

676
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
given

677
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,159
the unobservable state which is called a

678
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
prior so that's like

679
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
had to do with cats and meowing or in a

680
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
previous example or it has to do with

681
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600
like

682
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,080
if there were lightning yes or no what

683
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
would be the likelihood of me observing

684
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
photons

685
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,559
multiplied by the probability of those

686
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,880
unobservable states happening which is

687
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
of course a prior about them but it

688
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
could be

689
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,840
set with empirical data

690
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,520
divided by how likely the data are which

691
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,080
is called p of b the marginal likelihood

692
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
or evidence

693
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,400
okay so p of a given b is called the

694
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
posterior because it's like after

695
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
you've done your inference you want the

696
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
correct posterior which is like updated

697
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
beliefs about how likely the thing that

698
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,279
you care about a is given what has come

699
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,480
in

700
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
priors are like prior to this round of

701
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
inference

702
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
what are your beliefs about how likely a

703
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,039
is

704
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,080
and then

705
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,480
the evidence coming in is be

706
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,520
okay

707
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
and the likelihood is how likely the

708
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
data are

709
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,279
under the prior distribution

710
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,840
so that's bayes theorem and we've talked

711
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,279
about it multiple times and i'm sure

712
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
there's other awesome videos and courses

713
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,000
that can explain it even better

714
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
how are they using it here

715
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
to describe the dynamics of an ensemble

716
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
of information processing agent like

717
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
cells

718
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
as a process of bayesian belief updating

719
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
we need to relate the stochastic

720
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
differential equations governing

721
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
newtonian motion

722
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
and biochemical activity to the

723
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
probabilistic quantities above

724
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,039
long sentence but

725
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,120
it's kind of saying we need to connect

726
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,520
these variables which are informational

727
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,799
they're probabilistic they're

728
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,279
statistical to

729
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,320
movement in space

730
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
movement in a newtonian coordinate

731
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,600
system

732
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
because we need these variables to

733
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,840
measure spatial movement so we can study

734
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,720
morphogenesis this is fairly

735
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,600
straightforward to do if we

736
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
associate biophysical states with the

737
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,159
parameters of a probability density

738
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,080
and ensure their dynamics perform a

739
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,919
gradient flow on a quantity called

740
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,399
variational free energy

741
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
variational free energy is a quantity in

742
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
bayesian statistics that

743
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
when minimized

744
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
ensures the parameterized density

745
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,679
converges to the posterior belief as we

746
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,960
will see below

747
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,679
so yes this is our first slide on bayes

748
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
theorem and we did just kind of go from

749
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,919
the total

750
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
description of the variables and what is

751
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,840
bayes theorem out of first pass to this

752
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,279
introduction of the variational free

753
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,640
energy so

754
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,520
it can be accordioned out and unpacked a

755
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,120
lot more but

756
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,600
what variational free energy is doing

757
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,080
is helping us tractably

758
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
converge to

759
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,840
the appropriate posterior

760
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,360
belief and that's its role here

761
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
okay

762
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
anything to add on this one dean

763
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
well i'll ask you a question so if you

764
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,039
were to talk to this to somebody for the

765
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,240
first time

766
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
not people who probably listened to

767
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
other of our live streams

768
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,320
would you say that it would be

769
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
um dangerous to say that we're taking

770
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
something that's kind of ratio based

771
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
and now

772
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,679
using that to try to build a model of

773
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,440
what our predictions

774
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,799
are going to

775
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,320
be based on

776
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,600
is that

777
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,559
is that fair to say

778
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,360
i believe so

779
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
it's like

780
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,960
one way to approach that

781
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,880
i hope this would be accessible the

782
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
ratio-based part is on the right-hand

783
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,360
side

784
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,320
and um one could say depending on like

785
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
how much data you're getting and what

786
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
you're trying to estimate it could be

787
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,399
very hard to go from

788
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,279
observations to inference on hidden

789
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,640
states

790
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
pretty fair conclusion

791
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,600
so

792
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
what we could do

793
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,440
would be construct a smooth

794
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
approximatable model

795
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,679
so that when we slide to the bottom of

796
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,760
our model just like the ball sliding

797
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
down the hill

798
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,279
we would actually be doing the same

799
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,720
thing as

800
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
fitting this effectively

801
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,480
so instead of like number crunching and

802
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,919
putting everything into this equation

803
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,840
and running the calculation

804
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
we're going to construct

805
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,279
a bowl

806
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
which is the variational free energy

807
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
that we can do gradient descent on that

808
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,919
is going to converge to a really good

809
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,440
solution

810
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
do we construct it or do they do they

811
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,120
kind of tell us that

812
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,960
we should assume it if we want to make

813
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,679
it tractable

814
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,639
assume the bowl

815
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
when we pick up this instrument

816
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
we're making variational free energy

817
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,799
bowls

818
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
yeah okay good

819
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,640
and we've seen this before

820
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
um

821
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,960
in

822
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,159
live streams

823
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,760
26

824
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,799
32 and 34

825
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,120
we did some variants on moving from

826
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,640
bayes theorem and exact base

827
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
to

828
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,720
variational inference which uses this

829
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,279
variational free energy value

830
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
so those are a few times that we've seen

831
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,840
this discussed before

832
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,399
in neuroscience the minimization of

833
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,399
variational free energy

834
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,080
is referred to as

835
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,159
active inference

836
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,000
we will see that the basic when the

837
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
basic condition for an inference type

838
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
description of a system

839
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,640
namely the existence of a markov blanket

840
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
separating external and internal states

841
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,120
is satisfied

842
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,679
agents such as biological cells form

843
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,640
into organized conglomerations based on

844
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
their generative model of how their

845
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
blanket states influence

846
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
and are influenced by

847
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
external states in the external milieu

848
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,399
so the connection between bayes theorem

849
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,120
and markov blankets is the unobservables

850
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
are external states

851
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,320
the observables are blanket states

852
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,480
it's a pretty fair model

853
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
whether it also provides like strong

854
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,720
guarantees on optimal perception or

855
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
optional action that's another

856
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
discussion but

857
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
at the very least it's a fair framing

858
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,559
that external states are unobserved if

859
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,840
you could observe them they'd be

860
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,640
observables then they'd be more like b

861
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
than a

862
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,200
so we're talking about a situation where

863
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
we have some a's and we have some b's

864
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,799
and we're going to think about that in

865
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,880
terms of a blanket formalism

866
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,679
and

867
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,519
the dynamics of a system with a markov

868
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,960
blanket that self-organizes to

869
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,039
non-equilibrium steady states can be

870
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,519
described as a gradient flow on this

871
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,519
computable variational free energy bound

872
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,240
so we can set up the blanket and it

873
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
turns out that we don't have to do the

874
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,159
ratio number crunch we can do

875
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,880
the bowl gliding down

876
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
that's the beginning part on just bays

877
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
that takes us from bayes theorem to

878
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,080
introducing variational free energy and

879
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,159
doing gradient descent on variational

880
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
free energy

881
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,039
so that one can effectively essentially

882
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,799
perform bayesian inference

883
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,559
cool

884
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,360
perfect okay section two mathematical

885
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
foundations

886
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
all right

887
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,679
so section 2.1 stability and convergence

888
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,159
in coupled dynamical systems and

889
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,840
subsection 1 the helmholtz decomposition

890
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,200
so they write the helmholtz

891
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,799
decomposition states that any

892
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,480
sufficiently smooth

893
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,760
i.e possessing continuous derivatives

894
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,519
vector field f

895
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,320
can be decomposed into an irrotational

896
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,679
curl free

897
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,279
so kind of

898
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
straight up and down putting the ruler

899
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,679
and finding the slope of a hill

900
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,039
and

901
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,440
a solenoidal divergence-free vector

902
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,720
field the divergence free solenoidal is

903
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,480
like putting the ruler

904
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
at ground level

905
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
and then being able to make an iso

906
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
contour around a hill

907
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,240
because an irrotational vector field has

908
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
only a scalar potential

909
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
and the solenoidal vector field has only

910
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,360
a vector potential we can express the

911
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,240
vector field as

912
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,159
insert formalism two

913
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,159
and just so people know the upside down

914
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,600
triangle is called del or nabla which

915
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,799
means harp due to the shape

916
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,480
so del

917
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
phi

918
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,679
is

919
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
the irrotational

920
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,440
vector field

921
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,679
del a is the solenoidal field

922
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,719
we talked about this mostly in

923
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,760
um

924
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
number 26 and 32

925
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,918
where we talked about the partition or

926
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,280
the decomposition

927
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,639
into a solenoidal and a gradient

928
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,520
as well as this housekeeping term which

929
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
was

930
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,800
everyone's favorite housekeeping term so

931
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
we're not um

932
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,960
having a housekeeping term here

933
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,679
but we're keeping in mind that it's not

934
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
implausible that

935
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,800
it's

936
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,280
still there

937
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,839
it's just that there was a whole paper

938
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,280
coming out after

939
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
this morphogenesis paper

940
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,399
that

941
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,639
talked about the housekeeping etc so

942
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
again it wouldn't be surprising if a

943
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,440
future morphogenesis paper or project

944
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,560
did have this housekeeping term but um

945
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,520
32 was actually a later paper so that

946
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
might be a more advanced placed um or

947
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,599
updated place to check out

948
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,560
how the partition i'm sorry the um

949
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
helmholtz decomposition works

950
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,839
and here was a image from

951
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,760
just showing how you could have like a

952
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,640
kind of

953
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
um

954
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
hill

955
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,599
and in physics you could have hill

956
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,839
climbing and trying to get to the top

957
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,880
or

958
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
sometimes it's easier to think about

959
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
that as like the flip

960
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,839
and the ball rolling to the bottom of

961
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,839
the hill so whether it's the optimistic

962
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,880
biologists talking about going up to the

963
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,599
fitness peak or whether it's the

964
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,160
pessimistic physicists talking about

965
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,800
going to the bottom of the energy well

966
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,640
it's the same idea

967
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,079
that there's a particle on a landscape

968
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,640
and there's been a ton of work on

969
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
passive particles that's not to say

970
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,680
immobile particles but particles that

971
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,599
roll and get trapped and then once

972
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,160
they're trapped they stay or they jiggle

973
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
stochastically

974
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,119
we're studying active particles and so

975
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,200
that's where action selection comes into

976
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,599
play landscapes of energy with balls

977
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,200
rolling down them but they're kind of

978
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
like jumping beans where they also have

979
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
a few tricks that they can play

980
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
okay anything to add here

981
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,920
just just a reminder to people that

982
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,359
that's a density that we're looking at

983
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,760
not not a

984
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
not a

985
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,680
not a vacuum it's a

986
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,920
i know most people when they hear like

987
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
if i was to talk to younger people and

988
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
they started imagining a ball rolling

989
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
down a hill they would they wouldn't

990
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,400
necessarily

991
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
confirm that it's an

992
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
actual density that we're looking at so

993
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
just reinforce that

994
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
yeah like the bottom right here it's

995
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,680
kind of like you're looking down at an

996
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,800
ink drop

997
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
and that's where it's densest is where

998
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
it's darkest and then that is like a

999
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,520
landscape where where it's darkest is

1000
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
highest

1001
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
right

1002
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
okay

1003
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
section two one two the openiv functions

1004
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
okay so the opposite functions have been

1005
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
used extensively in dynamical systems

1006
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
theory and engineering

1007
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
to characterize the stability of fixed

1008
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,359
points of a dynamical system

1009
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,040
the operative functions are generally

1010
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
defined for smooth systems through the

1011
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,560
following conditions

1012
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,960
so l is going to be the leopard if

1013
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
function

1014
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,078
and x is going to be a point

1015
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
so

1016
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
a fixed point is going to be x star

1017
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,280
and a non-fixed point is going to be

1018
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,079
just regular x so x star the special

1019
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
points where if you are there you're

1020
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,119
perfectly balanced

1021
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,240
so

1022
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
this is saying that

1023
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,760
at fixed points

1024
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,599
the lyapunov function

1025
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,680
evaluates as zero

1026
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,599
and it's not zero

1027
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,760
if it's not a fixed point

1028
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
and

1029
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
the leaping function

1030
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,400
change in l with respect to time

1031
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
it's below zero

1032
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,040
for all x

1033
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,839
equation three a requires the leopard

1034
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,240
function to be minimal for fixed points

1035
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,960
x star representing local minima

1036
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
and b denotes conversions to these fixed

1037
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,079
points over time so what does it mean to

1038
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,720
have a leopard value of 0

1039
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,680
above zero or below zero so if you're at

1040
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,520
zero just like it said with the fixed

1041
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,280
points that means that it's not moving

1042
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,480
at all

1043
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
a leopard if exponent below zero means

1044
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,280
that things are converging towards

1045
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,640
the openiv

1046
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,000
bigger than zero means diverging away

1047
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,079
specifically what it means is two points

1048
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,440
that are really really close to each

1049
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,400
other

1050
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
do they stay exactly the same distance

1051
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,200
away that's zero

1052
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,040
a negatively operative means that two

1053
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,359
points close to each other will converge

1054
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,599
so that's a convergence attractor

1055
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,160
and then positively open of exponents

1056
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,839
the opposite values

1057
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,079
mean that two points that are placed

1058
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,000
very close to each other will diverge

1059
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
away from each other

1060
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,640
i hope i have not oversimplified or made

1061
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
unforced errors about the opponent

1062
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,680
functions because it's obviously a

1063
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,920
really technical area

1064
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,640
and they write following 16 we can

1065
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
generalize this local leopard function

1066
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,160
of stability

1067
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,960
so zero equal fixed point positive

1068
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
equals divergence negative equals

1069
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,200
convergence to a globally open a

1070
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
function that plays the role of a

1071
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
potential function of any dynamical

1072
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,160
system

1073
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,440
and we won't go into it but it is the

1074
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,480
citation to this ryoshi

1075
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
paper from 2013

1076
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,720
and they do some pretty interesting math

1077
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
so if somebody's more familiar with this

1078
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,960
it would be awesome to hear about

1079
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
but what this is doing is it's taking

1080
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
this same dynamical systems perspective

1081
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
that we've been thinking about about

1082
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,440
things changing through time and then

1083
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,040
overlaying

1084
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
on that landscape

1085
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,760
a stability landscape and so if we think

1086
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,319
about like this hill on the top right

1087
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,000
again hopefully not

1088
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,040
being

1089
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,520
wrong or misleading here

1090
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,079
at the very top of the hill

1091
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,160
it's like a fixed point it's an unstable

1092
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,839
fixed point but if one were perfectly

1093
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,240
balanced there we could just say

1094
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
um it could get knocked off by

1095
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,440
stochastic things which we'll come back

1096
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,119
later but it's perfectly balanced it's

1097
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,040
like a fixed point

1098
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
two points that were very close to each

1099
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,760
other

1100
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,119
on a hill

1101
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,640
two balls placed right next to each

1102
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
other would start to diverge as they

1103
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,520
rolled down the hill

1104
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,760
so that would be like a slight

1105
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,440
divergence

1106
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,920
and so that is what the lyapunov

1107
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
function as potential function is

1108
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,839
allowing it's allowing us to take the

1109
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,119
landscape of ball rolling where gravity

1110
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,880
is the potential function

1111
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
the higher up the more potential you

1112
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,079
have and then it rolls down because the

1113
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,480
dissipation of potential energy

1114
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,160
and they're going to

1115
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,760
um

1116
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,319
show that any dynamics with lyapunov

1117
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
function so any smooth differentiable

1118
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,119
etc landscape has a corresponding

1119
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
physical realization a friction force a

1120
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
lorentz force and a potential function

1121
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,920
so we can think about this leopard

1122
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
function being related to potential

1123
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,520
functions like something that draws the

1124
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,880
system back

1125
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,560
that's where the negative lyapunov comes

1126
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,280
into play okay dean

1127
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,359
just a quick thing daniel

1128
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,440
when we were setting up the slides

1129
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,880
between those two bullets um they they

1130
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,560
talked about something called a saddle

1131
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,319
point did you understand what a saddle

1132
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,000
point was

1133
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,720
previous to reading this or do you know

1134
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,119
what a saddle point is now

1135
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,560
yes let us i'm just pulling up the um

1136
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,200
paper in the window okay so people can

1137
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,480
see it

1138
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,640
um okay so

1139
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,240
yeah the stability um okay

1140
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,079
so it's the following sentence so we can

1141
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,680
generalize the leop the function to a

1142
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,200
global function that plays the role of a

1143
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,920
potential function of any system

1144
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,680
this follows by generalizing condition a

1145
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,839
to allow for saddle points

1146
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,480
so a saddle point is when the landscape

1147
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,720
is shaped like a saddle

1148
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,119
and there's like um

1149
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,280
so if it were on top of a hill

1150
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,040
the curvature is negative with respect

1151
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,119
to all directions

1152
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,920
right in a saddle point the curvature is

1153
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,680
negative with respect to one of the

1154
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,760
dimensions

1155
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
but it's positive with respect to

1156
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
another dimension

1157
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,000
and so it's just like just like a saddle

1158
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,880
yeah

1159
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,839
okay

1160
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,359
why do they call it that um and so

1161
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,400
the ball on the top of the hill

1162
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,520
is like an infinite multifurcator

1163
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,280
like a little jiggle it could go any

1164
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,400
direction

1165
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,359
because it's unstable in every direction

1166
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,640
saddle points

1167
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,400
induce a symmetry

1168
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,800
where that ball is never going to roll

1169
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,319
up the hill

1170
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,920
it's going to fall to one side of the

1171
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,319
saddle or the other side of the saddle

1172
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,800
and one of those could be like um

1173
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,240
a certain attractor and the other one

1174
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,599
could be like another elevation

1175
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,720
basically

1176
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,839
um

1177
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,079
though i don't know the details of how

1178
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,480
the saddle point is related to

1179
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
some of this lyapunov stuff

1180
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,440
okay

1181
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,720
all right so following

1182
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,000
16

1183
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,119
so this is they're showing that the

1184
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,200
leopardive is equivalent to a potential

1185
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
function

1186
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,000
in physics a potential function psi

1187
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
can be constructed to describe the flow

1188
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,800
of

1189
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
or forces acting on

1190
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,119
a particle through a potential energy

1191
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,400
gradient

1192
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,319
so the potential

1193
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,640
energy function f is

1194
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,760
del

1195
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
psi

1196
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,319
so here's just one way to state the big

1197
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,160
idea of equations five through nine

1198
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,920
which are not discussed here

1199
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,160
so the idea is create a potential

1200
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
function

1201
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,599
and when you think of potential function

1202
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,560
think it's like kinetic energy

1203
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,960
based upon elevation

1204
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,079
but it's not for gravity and elevation

1205
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,079
it's like balls falling down tall

1206
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
buildings

1207
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,200
but for

1208
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,720
not gravity

1209
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,240
for something that's related to

1210
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,400
dynamical conversions

1211
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,000
so if you were like at the bottom of the

1212
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,520
bowl you'd only have a little bit of

1213
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,280
potential energy

1214
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,440
the potential function would be low if

1215
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,599
you were really far up the ball

1216
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,359
wall you'd have a high potential

1217
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,880
function you'd have a long way to fall

1218
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,000
that

1219
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,480
is going to be reflected by a balance of

1220
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,079
forces

1221
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,680
namely an attractor force

1222
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
which is the combination of the lorenz

1223
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,839
force and the potential energy-induced

1224
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,800
force

1225
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,880
and then there's the dissipative force

1226
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
and that's the frictional force

1227
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,839
due to dissipative random fluctuations

1228
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,720
so

1229
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,640
that's like the velcro ball on the

1230
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,440
velcro bowl

1231
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
the friction is so high

1232
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,400
that it still is being kept on the side

1233
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,240
or it's rolling down very slowly or

1234
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,839
something like that

1235
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,200
combining these definitions we can

1236
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
express the total balance total force as

1237
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
a balance of the forces defined above

1238
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,560
resulting in

1239
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,119
and so just like if it was two colliding

1240
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,680
vectors and then we were gonna express

1241
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
the outcome resultant as like the total

1242
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,920
forces being applied on something

1243
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,079
it's like that but it's not about the

1244
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,319
physical forces in the gravity it's like

1245
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,880
more about

1246
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,319
these forces

1247
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,200
abstractly and so equation 10 is

1248
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,839
expressing this balance of forces

1249
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,839
on

1250
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,880
x using a gradient landscape so there's

1251
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,920
that

1252
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,680
del psi

1253
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,400
and here's the combination of forces

1254
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,520
being expressed as

1255
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,640
del psi dean

1256
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,680
so

1257
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,359
they use the word tensor here and when i

1258
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,359
was reading this i didn't

1259
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,920
i didn't see it i mean okay so if we're

1260
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,319
having a tug of war on a rope

1261
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,800
it might appear to the outsider upside

1262
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,920
outside observer that there's a balance

1263
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,839
but really what i read into this and

1264
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,079
maybe i'm wrong was that there's a

1265
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,200
tension

1266
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,119
between these two forces

1267
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,560
between the attractive force and the

1268
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,240
dissipative force am i

1269
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,839
am i misinterpreting that

1270
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,240
someone has a different answer would be

1271
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,280
awesome to hear it a tensor is like a

1272
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
generalization of a matrix it's like a

1273
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,680
matrix through time

1274
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
i don't think that

1275
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,480
it is directly related to tensile or

1276
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,240
tensegrity

1277
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
okay that being said you're right that

1278
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,079
there is

1279
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,200
a tension between these forces or there

1280
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,480
can be

1281
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,599
and that they like tension

1282
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,960
can reflect

1283
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,720
like a compromised position like if you

1284
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,640
have a rope with tension on it

1285
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,280
then the ending of the rope is going to

1286
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,839
be like some compromise between the

1287
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,359
various forces

1288
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,559
and so we're thinking about like the

1289
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,559
various forces

1290
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,640
and then we're expressing it as like

1291
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,240
this matrix

1292
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,440
through time

1293
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,960
that's what makes it a tensor not the

1294
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,440
fact that the forces are in tension or

1295
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,240
um opposition with each other yeah okay

1296
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
i hope that's accurate okay

1297
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,880
um

1298
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,160
and then they follow 16 again

1299
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,880
and transform that expression in 10

1300
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,119
into a more standard form using the

1301
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,160
diffusion tensor gamma

1302
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,598
and a tensor q

1303
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,800
this is like a rewriting

1304
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,599
that helps them get to this format

1305
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,839
where f x is describing the flow of

1306
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,240
states so that's the change in states

1307
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,920
through time

1308
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,000
and it's like a vector field

1309
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
and it is going to be q minus gamma

1310
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,160
so

1311
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,280
tensor

1312
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,160
minus diffusion

1313
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,799
both of that so that multiplied by

1314
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,680
that landscape

1315
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,720
so that's kind of like the

1316
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,720
decomposition

1317
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,200
but if someone could explain this more

1318
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,359
let's hear it

1319
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,760
and my simple words this is where i i i

1320
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
keep bringing up the idea that

1321
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,280
maybe when we're looking at these things

1322
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,640
through an active inference lens we're

1323
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,720
not just looking through a frame

1324
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
we're also looking through and they talk

1325
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
about filters later on

1326
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,720
so

1327
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,319
so like

1328
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,920
how do we how do we make sure that we're

1329
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,599
including both

1330
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,559
and that and sort of the tension between

1331
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,599
both of those views working

1332
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,920
together and being in tension with one

1333
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,760
another so yeah

1334
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,079
this is very this is very formal

1335
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,400
but i think it kind of reinforces that

1336
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,920
there's there's

1337
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,599
what's inside the

1338
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,040
the

1339
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,800
the partitions and then what's going on

1340
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,240
within them as well

1341
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,200
yeah

1342
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,440
and it um so it's describing the flow of

1343
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
states resulting from this conservative

1344
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,319
and dissipative forces so if q and gamma

1345
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,079
were the same

1346
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,200
then the flow would be zero

1347
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,920
if one is larger than the other then

1348
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,000
it's going to be dominated by that

1349
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,680
component with respect to being

1350
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,079
multiplied by this landscape

1351
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,280
so

1352
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,079
we'll return to it many times

1353
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,960
okay

1354
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,559
variational free energy um

1355
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,640
what did you want to add on this slide

1356
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,960
well i i don't know that there any i

1357
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
mean most people already know what we're

1358
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,720
talking about in terms of variation free

1359
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
energy but what they what they're doing

1360
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,280
is introducing it in terms of so now

1361
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,960
where does the model

1362
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,880
the model of a of a

1363
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,960
biological entity

1364
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,720
where is that sourced from and that's

1365
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
this sort of idea of these

1366
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
these

1367
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,240
these things like

1368
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,359
posterior beliefs the foundation or the

1369
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,720
the idea that we we don't walk into a

1370
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,119
situation completely blind we have some

1371
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,040
sort of prior

1372
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,720
and we're modeling situations where

1373
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,240
internal states can be interpreted and

1374
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,280
framed as a generative model so it's not

1375
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,960
they're focusing on the model aspect of

1376
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,880
this as opposed to the generative

1377
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
processing side they're gonna they're

1378
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,280
going to talk about what the external

1379
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
milieu is and where the generative

1380
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,240
process is here shortly

1381
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,839
great so

1382
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,240
good point to pause the video and read

1383
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,599
this because we're not going to read it

1384
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,280
out here but you're absolutely right

1385
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,400
they're focusing on the generative model

1386
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
of the agent of the cell

1387
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
not

1388
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
doing that

1389
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,040
analysis on the niche for example

1390
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,240
all right

1391
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,559
section 2.2.1

1392
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,280
okay so this is a fun part

1393
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,760
we can describe dynamics in generalized

1394
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,079
coordinates of motion denoted with a

1395
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,119
tilde

1396
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,000
where x tilde is defined as

1397
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
x tilde equals x that's like the

1398
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,040
absolute state of x and then x with a

1399
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,839
dot is the first derivative of x that's

1400
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,359
called velocity

1401
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,319
x with two dots is um or a two double

1402
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,880
prime depending on the notation is the

1403
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,480
acceleration

1404
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,400
what people don't always know is that

1405
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,760
there are higher derivatives and they

1406
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,079
also have names so the third derivative

1407
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,000
is the jerk and then the fourth fifth

1408
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,559
and sixth are the snap crackle and pop

1409
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,119
so that's just kind of funny

1410
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,880
but the generalized coordinates of

1411
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,760
motion which came up in

1412
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,160
number 26

1413
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,319
have to do with doing

1414
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,119
prediction on not just

1415
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,319
um

1416
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,200
how high or low something is or like on

1417
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,720
the number line left and right that

1418
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,200
would be like if x were just one number

1419
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
but even if it's just one number that

1420
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,960
we're tracking like body temperature for

1421
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,079
example

1422
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,839
we might be interested in kind of

1423
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,520
unpacking that

1424
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,599
into this generalized coordinate where

1425
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,599
we want to know body temperature and how

1426
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,119
fast it's changing

1427
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,440
and how fast that is changing

1428
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,880
and so one can imagine that once a zero

1429
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,920
has been achieved

1430
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,359
the higher derivatives are also zero if

1431
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,200
it's zero through time the higher

1432
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,119
derivatives are also zero

1433
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,880
if it's zero instantaneously that's not

1434
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,160
always the case

1435
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
but if it's zero through time then it's

1436
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,319
kind of like you've cashed out the

1437
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,400
derivatives the derivative of zero just

1438
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,200
stays at zero and so it's like if the

1439
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,880
position is unchanging

1440
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,720
the velocity is zero

1441
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,839
ends

1442
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,480
if the position is five miles an hour

1443
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,359
going in the same direction the velocity

1444
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,400
is constant but the acceleration is zero

1445
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,960
so keep on carrying that out to how fast

1446
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
things are changing how fast they change

1447
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,040
et cetera et cetera

1448
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
and then they're going to take that x

1449
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,720
tilde

1450
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,839
how x tilde changes with time x tilde

1451
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,440
dot

1452
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,640
equals

1453
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,200
the flow on tilde

1454
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,119
plus

1455
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,319
a variance

1456
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,400
so a noise or fluctuation a random

1457
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,079
fluctuation term

1458
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,240
this is the form of the langfine

1459
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,160
equation

1460
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,400
generalized coordinates of motion

1461
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,839
plus

1462
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,280
a random fluctuation term

1463
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,400
um

1464
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,599
any of the

1465
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,440
mathematical colleagues would be awesome

1466
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,480
to hear

1467
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,240
how this is related to the weiner

1468
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,760
assumptions

1469
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,160
etc but we're going to continue

1470
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,079
so

1471
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,240
using the helmholtz decomposition we can

1472
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,319
now express steady state flow in terms

1473
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,640
of a divergence free component and a

1474
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,319
curl free descent on a scalar of the

1475
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,440
operative function l of x tilde

1476
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,800
to obtain

1477
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,200
f of x tilde

1478
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,319
equals there's the q minus gamma that we

1479
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,480
saw a few slides ago multiplied by now

1480
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,079
the l

1481
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,480
so here we had f of x

1482
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,280
not generalized coordinates of motion

1483
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,880
q minus gamma

1484
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,000
del

1485
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,480
psi of x that was the potential function

1486
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,000
now because the potential function and

1487
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,480
lyapunov are related to each other

1488
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,000
we're looking at the generalized

1489
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,480
coordinates of motion

1490
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,960
using the same q minus gamma helmholtz

1491
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,760
decomposition but multiplying it now by

1492
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
the opening of exponents or i'm sorry

1493
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,680
the lyapunov function on

1494
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,920
x tilde

1495
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,520
it's the solution at non-equilibrium

1496
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,119
steady state and is exactly the same

1497
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,839
solution

1498
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,720
for

1499
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,319
the flow of particles in the classical

1500
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,880
treatment above

1501
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,960
crucially we can now see the operative

1502
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,280
function is the negative log probability

1503
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,440
of finding the system in any generalized

1504
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,400
state

1505
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,640
the leopard of x tilde is the negative

1506
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,640
natural log of

1507
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,400
how surprised

1508
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,040
one should be p of x tilde this is known

1509
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,400
as self-information of a state in

1510
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,440
information theory surprisal or surprise

1511
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,799
in bayesian statistics it is the

1512
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,200
negative log evidence so

1513
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,040
the change in the generalized

1514
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
coordinates of motion

1515
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,440
f of x tilde

1516
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,200
breathe

1517
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,760
is an irrotational solenoidal

1518
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,000
decomposition

1519
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,760
that's the left part of the right hand

1520
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,920
side

1521
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,040
multiplied by a lyapunov function

1522
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,960
which also has the interpretation of

1523
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,960
surprisal

1524
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,799
so if you are exactly

1525
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,440
resting so to speak

1526
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,119
you'd be totally unsurprised

1527
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,440
in summary any weekly mixing dynamical

1528
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,280
system at non-equilibrium steady state

1529
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,480
will events give us evidence for or look

1530
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
like it is

1531
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
a flow that can be decomposed into a

1532
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,359
gradient flow on surprise and an

1533
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,960
accompanying solenoidal flow

1534
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,720
because we can associate the lyapunov

1535
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,040
function in 18 with a free energy

1536
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,760
the system is effectively minimizing

1537
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
a free energy in its convergence to a

1538
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,000
set of attracting states

1539
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
which have a high probability of being

1540
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,559
occupied

1541
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,559
so it's a little

1542
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,440
circular it's like

1543
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,280
we're finding ourselves where we expect

1544
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,359
to find ourself

1545
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,040
and so if we just said well how

1546
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,400
surprised are we

1547
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,040
and let's gradient descend towards not

1548
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,799
being surprised

1549
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,880
just at a first approximation

1550
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,480
we would find ourselves

1551
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,799
in regions of low surprise

1552
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,280
and we would be surprised to find

1553
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,960
ourselves in regions of high surprise

1554
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,440
is it is it circular or is it kind of

1555
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,000
the byproduct of a recursive

1556
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,559
process

1557
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,000
again i'm asking i'm not questioning

1558
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,799
it's a great question

1559
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,319
in like a really

1560
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,880
meta way all of math is circular once

1561
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,960
the axioms have been stated because like

1562
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,960
the equal sign is there so we're just

1563
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,400
you can add one to both sides and it

1564
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,839
would still be equal so is that circular

1565
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,400
right um it's useful

1566
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,559
and that's what matters for this paper

1567
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:45,920
okay yeah

1568
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,799
um

1569
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,319
we're not going to talk about it too

1570
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,599
much but in a dot one we absolutely will

1571
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,079
and that's this least action principles

1572
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,640
in 2-2-2

1573
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,880
and they even give the example we love

1574
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,839
to see

1575
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,319
for example in colonies ants find the

1576
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,880
path of least action to harvest food and

1577
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,960
bring it to the colony

1578
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,640
citation needed slash let's see that

1579
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,640
but conceptually

1580
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,079
no problem

1581
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,079
this example considers their paths as

1582
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,400
flow channels or trajectories finding

1583
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,640
the least average action for each

1584
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,960
instance of foraging given available

1585
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,400
resources

1586
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,119
so

1587
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,400
what does least action principle mean

1588
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,200
what does least action mean

1589
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,040
and what is it necessary or sufficient

1590
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,920
for because certainly foraging is not

1591
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,319
the least biochemical expenditure of

1592
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,599
energy

1593
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,079
that's like the sort of

1594
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,839
naive interpretation of least action

1595
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,079
meaning just stay where you are

1596
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,920
but we're thinking about a usage of

1597
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,839
least

1598
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,400
action that impels this ant to forage in

1599
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,000
an adaptive way

1600
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,559
such that even when it's foraging trip

1601
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,480
is hard and the seat is heavy and it

1602
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,319
gets like lost or something

1603
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,559
that is still a realization of at least

1604
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,119
action on something it's still a ball

1605
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,359
rolling down a hill as efficiently as it

1606
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,880
can

1607
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,839
in a space

1608
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,680
so it's a

1609
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,440
nuanced topic that

1610
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,200
it will be great to discuss

1611
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
because they also write minimization of

1612
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,799
action in an open system leads to

1613
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,880
structure formation

1614
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,200
so that'd be a good thing to unpack okay

1615
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,759
carrying on

1616
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,200
in dissipative random dynamical systems

1617
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,119
action is not minimized for each element

1618
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,880
of the system

1619
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,119
but on average over an ensemble of

1620
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,599
elements or repeated trajectories of the

1621
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,480
same element

1622
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,599
since self-organizing open systems are

1623
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,359
not conservative

1624
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,720
their structured flow is

1625
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,399
quintessentially dissipative

1626
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,640
good to

1627
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,240
think about that and hear many

1628
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,319
perspectives and questions on it

1629
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,359
classically for a conservative system

1630
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,480
the lagrangian is defined as l

1631
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,520
this is

1632
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,880
l not the operative now it's lagrangian

1633
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
equals t minus v

1634
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
so t is the kinetic energy

1635
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,119
of the particles and v is the potential

1636
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,520
energy

1637
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,079
[Music]

1638
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,160
and so that's how

1639
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,280
the

1640
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,119
trajectory of system states could be

1641
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,839
solved for a conservative system

1642
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,839
where the total energy is going to be

1643
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,599
conserved

1644
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,400
but

1645
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,599
they're

1646
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,640
opening up into this

1647
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,960
dissipative and open

1648
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,640
scenario

1649
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,920
where this is not going to cut it

1650
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,220
um

1651
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,760
[Music]

1652
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,680
a little bit more detail on least action

1653
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,280
which we're not going to go into

1654
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,520
okay

1655
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,319
continuing on

1656
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,319
two two three markov blanket

1657
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,000
okay

1658
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,640
a robust literature is developing about

1659
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,720
around the ability of cells and other a

1660
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,040
neural non-neural systems measuring

1661
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,960
aspects of their environment via

1662
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,079
specific sensors

1663
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,799
they introduce here the markov partition

1664
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,760
as this general case of

1665
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,960
separation of states into four

1666
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,599
categories

1667
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,200
e

1668
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,720
external states

1669
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,559
sensory states s

1670
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,599
active states a internal states i

1671
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,240
and so the little e is like it's a

1672
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,480
realization of big e that's the bigger

1673
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,680
space

1674
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,280
and then

1675
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,960
x tilde

1676
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,960
comes back

1677
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,799
and the generalized coordinates are

1678
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,359
going to be

1679
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,520
a realization of values of those

1680
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,480
partitioned states

1681
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,000
so we've talked about the markov blanket

1682
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,960
before

1683
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,119
but now we're interested in

1684
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,839
the generalized

1685
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,200
flow on

1686
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,000
the blanket partition states

1687
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,880
so

1688
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,200
here's what the markov blanket looks

1689
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,640
like

1690
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,038
and

1691
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,480
we'll talk more about it in the dot one

1692
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,200
and dot two what do the arrows mean and

1693
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,079
why are sense and action connected

1694
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,240
what part of the cell are we looking at

1695
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,240
is it a part of the cell is it a model

1696
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,520
of a cell

1697
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,799
all these things that have come up

1698
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,200
before but just to say that's their

1699
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,359
figure one and table one gives the math

1700
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,000
formalisms

1701
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
okay anything to add on markov before we

1702
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,400
continue

1703
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,359
no because we'll we'll unpack yeah

1704
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,960
so

1705
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,039
this is where they apply the markov

1706
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,240
blanket

1707
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,039
so m is describing the markov partition

1708
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,720
that defines the underlying random

1709
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,599
dynamical system such the cell

1710
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:03,680
so that is like um

1711
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,280
the uh

1712
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,200
model that's the partition markov

1713
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,960
partition of the cell

1714
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,160
so inserting c into a and b is going to

1715
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,839
give

1716
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:14,720
there's

1717
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,240
a is actions and i is internal states

1718
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,880
so the top equation is basically saying

1719
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,240
the flow

1720
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,000
on action

1721
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,640
is a function of sense action and

1722
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,160
internal

1723
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,599
and then

1724
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,760
it has a right hand side so the flow on

1725
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,799
action

1726
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,680
the performance of action

1727
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,039
is

1728
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,680
and then there's that gamma minus q

1729
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,440
but now they have a subscript a because

1730
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,480
it's those about the action landscape

1731
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,599
multiplied by del triangle on action

1732
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,760
tilde generalized action

1733
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,240
and then a self-surprisal

1734
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,760
looking like

1735
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,839
the self-surprise of

1736
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,240
sense action and internal conditioned on

1737
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,839
m partition

1738
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,799
and the bottom equation in b 30 b is

1739
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,640
basically the same

1740
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,640
but it's the flow on internal states

1741
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
f sub i on

1742
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,880
generalized states of sense action and i

1743
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,039
and that same gamma minus q

1744
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,440
del self-surprise condition on model

1745
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,760
so we're seeing some patterns come up

1746
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,000
and even if um it's like confusing and

1747
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,160
we all definitely are confused by it to

1748
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,240
some extent we're starting to see like

1749
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,839
some patterns

1750
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,400
why does it matter to focus so much on a

1751
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,200
and i the action

1752
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,280
and the internal states because those

1753
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,440
are like the ones we control

1754
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,520
we know we don't control external states

1755
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,640
directly

1756
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,240
maybe we can intervene so that they

1757
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,599
change differently but we know we don't

1758
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:46,960
control them

1759
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,599
we also don't directly control sense

1760
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,680
states we're getting dealt this hand

1761
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,640
every second by the niche the generative

1762
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,760
process

1763
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,359
and so we can

1764
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,440
take action so that we can expect

1765
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
different sensory outcomes but even then

1766
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,960
we wouldn't be controlling sensory

1767
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,160
outcomes

1768
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,200
and so

1769
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,720
a lot of active inference comes down to

1770
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,119
doing inference on

1771
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,559
internal model

1772
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,920
internal states

1773
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,319
generative model learning

1774
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,760
and

1775
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,319
action action selection

1776
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,799
flows on action

1777
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:23,090
um

1778
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,119
[Music]

1779
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,319
this

1780
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,240
bounds the surprise

1781
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,400
on the particular states which is the

1782
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,799
internal and the blanket states

1783
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:33,920
through

1784
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,960
control of the autonomous states which

1785
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,680
is just the action and internal states

1786
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,799
the states we control

1787
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
because of the sparsity

1788
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,799
of the blanket

1789
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,559
not every node is connected to every

1790
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,160
node

1791
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,760
there might be a factorized and

1792
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,599
tractable form

1793
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,760
to bound our surprise

1794
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,440
about the particular states

1795
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,000
in general it would be very difficult

1796
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
problem to solve

1797
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,559
however we can replace the lagrangian

1798
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,319
that's the one

1799
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,359
here

1800
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,359
that was like going to be used for

1801
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,720
conservative systems but it didn't

1802
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,319
really apply

1803
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,200
um

1804
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,799
with a variational free energy

1805
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,119
functional or of a probabilistic model

1806
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,440
of how a system thinks it should behave

1807
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,680
or how we think the system should think

1808
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,680
it should behave

1809
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,680
so it's hard to solve these

1810
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,200
generally but

1811
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,960
in practice there are heuristics such

1812
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,240
that these are approximatable

1813
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,640
section 2.4 goes like one layer deeper

1814
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,119
into kl divergence in the vfe but we're

1815
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,440
not going to go into it

1816
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,640
okay

1817
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,480
we're just going to keep on plowing

1818
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,359
through

1819
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,839
two three is bayesian filtering and

1820
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,680
self-organization

1821
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,119
we're not going to talk about it now but

1822
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,200
the big questions here are like how does

1823
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,319
bayesian statistics relate to identity

1824
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,960
and what is self-evidencing

1825
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,640
and there's probably a lot of other good

1826
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,200
questions we could ask like why does

1827
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,359
bayesian filtering and self-organization

1828
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,079
come here

1829
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,400
all right

1830
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,520
modeling morphogenesis so now we

1831
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,920
actually get to the contribution of the

1832
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,200
paper

1833
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,480
um which is the modeling of

1834
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,000
morphogenesis so they're going to

1835
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,440
illustrate self-organization to ness

1836
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,440
using the variational principles above

1837
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,280
by trying to explain the behavior of a

1838
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,039
model of pattern regulation by

1839
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,799
consideration of information processing

1840
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,559
and error minimization with respect to a

1841
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,799
specific target morphology in this

1842
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,359
setting the game changes subtly but

1843
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:42,559
profoundly

1844
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,280
it's a dean line if i ever read one

1845
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,520
um

1846
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,559
above

1847
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,720
which is what we've reviewed

1848
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,720
the dynamics of any random dynamical

1849
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,319
system equipped with a mark called

1850
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,079
blanket can be formulated in terms of a

1851
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,440
gradient flow on variational free energy

1852
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,359
that was just

1853
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,079
here the flow on action and the flow on

1854
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,319
internal states

1855
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,640
here we turn this formulation on its

1856
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,839
head

1857
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,319
by specifying a generative model

1858
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,799
an implicit vfe function

1859
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,880
and simulate self-organization by

1860
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,520
solving the equations of motion in

1861
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,158
equation 34.

1862
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,759
so they're going to specify the form of

1863
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,839
the attracting set

1864
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:28,560
v

1865
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,759
uh the generative model

1866
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,719
and then they're going to let it ride

1867
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,759
so

1868
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,679
we have to just talk down

1869
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,839
yeah

1870
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,158
they specify the external dynamics as

1871
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,920
the generative process

1872
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,198
that's the niche

1873
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,279
and the generative model

1874
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,279
of that process which is being described

1875
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,759
by the flow of internal states okay so

1876
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,600
we're going to look at the figures

1877
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,679
and then we're not going to even like go

1878
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,198
into the details so let's just look at

1879
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,439
the figures and see what they're doing

1880
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,640
so

1881
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,279
here's some empirical biology happening

1882
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,719
in the lab of mike levin and others

1883
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:07,439
so

1884
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,198
in a

1885
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,120
it turns out that when you dissect out

1886
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,319
the center of a flatworm a planarian

1887
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,479
those cells will remodel into a new worm

1888
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,359
so cutting out the middle and it reforms

1889
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,040
into this

1890
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,839
new

1891
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,560
flatworm and red is the head and then

1892
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,560
like blue is the tail

1893
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,759
so

1894
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,238
there's a self-organization

1895
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,439
of this target morphology even from an

1896
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,040
initially clumpy cell

1897
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,839
what they're going to do in b

1898
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,679
is showing like the final fixed point

1899
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,600
of these different cells so here we have

1900
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,759
like four different cell types there's

1901
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,880
like the red neural or head cells then

1902
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,760
yellow cells green cells and blue cell

1903
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,679
and then basically like this like three

1904
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,440
two one one

1905
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,560
um and then the bottom one it's this one

1906
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,480
maybe they change the green and the blue

1907
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,480
like i think these two should be green

1908
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,400
and the bottom should be blue but

1909
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,760
minor point but it's an attractor

1910
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,880
on

1911
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,920
this target morphology

1912
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,040
um

1913
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,880
and then

1914
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,000
c

1915
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,320
is describing a little bit about how it

1916
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,760
happens which is that cells are

1917
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
constantly comparing their sensed signal

1918
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,040
concentration like of a gradient of some

1919
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,120
um morphogen

1920
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,440
to expectations by minimizing their free

1921
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,120
energy functional

1922
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,840
so it's like what kind of a cell type am

1923
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,960
i

1924
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,320
and what should i be expecting

1925
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,440
flip side what should i be surprised by

1926
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,320
because to say what i expect is

1927
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,000
the other side of the coin of what one

1928
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,239
is surprised by okay so they're modeling

1929
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,880
this empirical scenario where a flatworm

1930
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,280
can regenerate its form from just a

1931
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,040
clump of cells here

1932
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,040
and that

1933
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,640
if we think about the location of these

1934
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,840
cells as being like a steady state

1935
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,800
attractor like we want to have this body

1936
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,400
form last

1937
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,480
then if all the cells just get in line

1938
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,280
like that everything's going to work out

1939
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,719
all right

1940
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,760
how do we take this

1941
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,600
first jump that we made from the

1942
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,520
empirical biology

1943
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,400
to the

1944
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,040
state space framing

1945
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,600
here it is an x y state space

1946
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,159
and now take the next jump

1947
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,120
one more mathematical

1948
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,199
here on the right side

1949
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,880
is

1950
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,080
that

1951
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,080
x y positioning of each cell

1952
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,760
this is reflected by the position

1953
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,480
in

1954
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,920
x and y

1955
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,480
of the cells so like negative nine and

1956
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,640
zero so that's like this top red one

1957
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,920
zero is the midline so it's like y and x

1958
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,600
and here like negative five it's a

1959
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,520
little lower

1960
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,280
and then like negative four and four

1961
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,760
it's like one is on they're on the same

1962
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,520
y elevation

1963
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,840
but then one is four to the left and one

1964
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,679
is um four to the right

1965
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,840
and so this e star of x

1966
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,480
is the position

1967
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,920
so it's um a matrix of position because

1968
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,199
there's like

1969
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,360
um eight cells

1970
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,920
and two location variables per cell so

1971
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,239
it's like a two by eight matrix

1972
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,000
and it changes through time so it's a

1973
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,640
tensor

1974
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,640
the e star c

1975
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,280
is the external signals

1976
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,560
and so

1977
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,600
in this

1978
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,920
steady state attractor

1979
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,640
all three red cells are getting like

1980
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,080
signal one here's the binary signal

1981
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,840
there are four signals but they only

1982
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,920
have an on or off state in reality

1983
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,400
there's many many more signals than four

1984
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,640
and there's a lot more uh nuance than

1985
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,560
just on or off but it's a

1986
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,840
it's a toy example all three red cells

1987
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,920
are getting the exact same signaling

1988
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,040
milieu

1989
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,960
of one one zero zero so factor a and b

1990
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,040
are diffusing near me

1991
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
but not c and d

1992
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,320
the yellow cells are experiencing

1993
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,320
those two diffuses and one other one

1994
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,000
the blue cells are experiencing the

1995
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,159
first the fourth and then the green one

1996
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,159
is another

1997
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,120
and so

1998
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,640
this is like the attractor state

1999
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,560
for a stable

2000
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,400
location

2001
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,960
and signaling expression

2002
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,320
so converging to this spatially makes

2003
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,159
your body look like that but the way

2004
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,800
that you get a beach ready planarian

2005
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,159
body like that

2006
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,960
is actually by reducing your

2007
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,440
your surprise on signal expression

2008
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,520
okay so here's them

2009
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,679
running it through time

2010
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,280
so it's a time-lapse movie montage

2011
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,840
of simulations of morphogenesis

2012
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,679
and so here it is converging towards on

2013
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,199
the right side

2014
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,800
the morphology that's been discussed

2015
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,560
here

2016
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,960
and so the cells start out with

2017
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,159
undifferentiated they know what they're

2018
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:23,920
sensing

2019
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,360
they don't know what kind of cell they

2020
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,159
are

2021
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,360
and they

2022
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,280
don't know where they are

2023
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,120
and then

2024
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,800
they sharpen

2025
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,640
their expectations about what kind of

2026
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,400
cell they are

2027
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,320
while also

2028
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,560
moving into a different spatial niche

2029
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,800
but they're not tracking their location

2030
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
like i'm at three comma two where are

2031
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,760
you

2032
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,159
it's like this is what i'm biochemically

2033
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,440
sensing

2034
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,159
and so it's a relational morphology

2035
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,840
that doesn't need the blueprint in the

2036
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,400
nucleus

2037
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,640
so it's a lot like an ant colony there's

2038
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,800
not the nest architecture blueprint in

2039
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,199
the brain there's the process for stigma

2040
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,320
g

2041
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,719
and then they show that with some other

2042
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,960
um changes

2043
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,679
in

2044
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,320
the generative process

2045
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,760
a positive squared gradient in the

2046
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
generative process

2047
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,000
they get double head formation

2048
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,800
which some modulations have been shown

2049
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,080
to empirically result in in the lab and

2050
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,760
they can also make it so it gets double

2051
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,800
tail formation

2052
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,320
so it's just recapitulating this basic

2053
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,000
example and then showing that like

2054
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,640
modifying the external field changes the

2055
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,960
morphology that gets attracted to

2056
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,760
so those are the key pieces that's

2057
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,080
modeling morphogenesis

2058
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:46,960
as

2059
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,320
bayesian inference

2060
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,400
reducing surprise

2061
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,239
with a variational free energy flow on

2062
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,920
action and internal states action states

2063
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,280
internal states

2064
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,360
okay

2065
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,320
um

2066
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,159
we're not gonna go into it here

2067
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,800
definitely for the dot one and dot two

2068
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,600
so um 3.1 is the construction of the

2069
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,920
model

2070
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,199
they then

2071
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,120
unpack that signal

2072
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,480
matrix

2073
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,839
the combination of the signals

2074
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,040
and then um

2075
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,800
[Music]

2076
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,960
they give even more information about

2077
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,199
modeling signals

2078
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,679
and they also imbue it here with like

2079
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,000
this steminess

2080
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,440
which helps the cells start out with um

2081
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,840
i believe a weaker prior

2082
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,000
about what kind of cell they are which

2083
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,840
translates to where they should be

2084
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,800
um

2085
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,480
in figure five

2086
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,800
they do a targeted intervention in their

2087
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,159
studying of anomalous cell behavior

2088
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,239
and so basically they start off with

2089
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,239
these um cells that have initially

2090
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:04,000
unspecified state and they converge in a

2091
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,800
this panels on a by 32 time points

2092
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,920
they're converged to the target

2093
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,679
morphology

2094
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,360
but in b

2095
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,199
they show that if one of the cells that

2096
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:17,839
gets hit with a white arrow here

2097
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,679
has a perturbed signaling response it

2098
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,679
fails to correctly infer its place in

2099
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,440
the ensemble

2100
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,560
so b is like sort of like um it could be

2101
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,640
like a genetic mutation or a targeted

2102
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,960
modification of the signaling and it's

2103
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,840
like that third red cell

2104
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,480
never forms

2105
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
and then in c

2106
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,719
the same aberrant cell from b is

2107
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,800
initially is rescued by an increased

2108
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,199
signaling sensitivity of other cells

2109
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,960
leading another cell

2110
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,400
green arrow

2111
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,159
to switch position with the aberrant

2112
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,120
cell pink arrow

2113
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,840
pretty

2114
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,159
cool okay yeah i wanted to come up with

2115
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,400
an analogy that would actually work that

2116
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,400
would explain this like if

2117
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,560
you're out geocaching one afternoon and

2118
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,239
then all of a sudden

2119
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,679
some

2120
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,199
something was able to turn all the

2121
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,360
lights off and then the person that was

2122
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,040
geocaching beside you change their

2123
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,800
behavior but i couldn't even come up

2124
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,360
with a valid analogy to try to explain

2125
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,320
this

2126
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,679
how about um

2127
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,560
uh we're playing american football

2128
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,719
and so there's a plan and everyone's

2129
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,000
trying to reduce their uncertainty about

2130
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,440
how the plan is playing out from their

2131
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,640
perspective

2132
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,159
and so if all goes to plan we're all

2133
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,080
going to deploy into the exact right

2134
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,280
positions

2135
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,400
but then

2136
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,400
somebody um doesn't move

2137
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,199
if each nestmate on the football team

2138
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,960
has low sensitivity

2139
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,880
then they're going to continue in their

2140
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,280
own expected trajectory as if nothing

2141
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,640
had happened that's kind of like what we

2142
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,360
see in b it's like a partial rollout

2143
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,560
whereas

2144
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,400
this is changing the environment mixing

2145
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,080
our metaphors etc

2146
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,960
so that a high sensitivity

2147
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,719
teammate

2148
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,719
fills in for that critical position so

2149
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,719
that the attractor state of the strategy

2150
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,520
can still be morphologically realized

2151
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,960
even though

2152
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,199
um there still is that one individual

2153
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,560
who's not moving

2154
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,880
but but they're not interfering

2155
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,800
with the strategy's attraction

2156
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,400
but we'll come up with probably some

2157
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,440
other and better ways to talk about it

2158
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,239
okay

2159
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,520
and then they um just mentioned that

2160
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,280
this is something that can be modeled

2161
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,920
and it's in spm

2162
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,360
and also on franz kuchling's um

2163
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,480
github

2164
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,640
so maybe we will um look at the code

2165
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,920
and then

2166
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,600
just to say that we're not going to go

2167
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,600
into it at all today but all of section

2168
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,080
4 is super interesting

2169
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,679
they review some of the mathematical

2170
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,320
assumptions and limitations of the model

2171
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,080
there's a really fascinating discussion

2172
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,400
about variational principles and open

2173
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,400
systems

2174
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,430
and so um

2175
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,520
[Music]

2176
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,520
like just to read we have shown that the

2177
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,360
variational free energy minimization in

2178
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,280
active inference is related to the

2179
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,000
variational principle of least action

2180
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,080
it is worth pointing out with where

2181
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,840
these two approaches

2182
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,840
diverge

2183
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,880
two instruments

2184
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,880
in a wood diverged

2185
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,000
and then it's all about that divergence

2186
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,760
and the contrasting

2187
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,080
and so

2188
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,280
i think there's gonna be a lot of

2189
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,639
unpacked there

2190
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,960
and then they have some closing remarks

2191
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,120
on the applicability in biological

2192
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,880
systems and some of the predictive

2193
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,960
capacities of the simulations

2194
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,719
um in terms of like you could make a

2195
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,159
simulation of a healthy functioning

2196
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,840
tissue and then have predictive capacity

2197
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,679
about asking counter factuals well what

2198
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,040
if this happened what might i expect so

2199
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,040
that is

2200
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,120
a lot of info so

2201
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,120
thanks to everybody who's been

2202
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,280
watching and

2203
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,120
again hope that especially with some of

2204
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,360
these technical parts

2205
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,600
that we were able to represent it with

2206
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,360
high integrity

2207
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,199
so you won't have the last word but what

2208
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,600
would you say in closing as we move from

2209
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,760
the dot zero into the one two and beyond

2210
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,679
well first of all you went through a

2211
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,080
heck of a lot of stuff in a very

2212
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,159
short period of time so that's that's

2213
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,080
quite the gradient flow right there so

2214
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,440
that's impressive

2215
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,120
um

2216
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,040
i don't think much in terms of i mean

2217
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,960
this is a classic example of where you

2218
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,719
have to unpack

2219
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,320
as opposed to

2220
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,239
lots of the other papers that are maybe

2221
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,560
more philosophically based whether you

2222
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,360
you

2223
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,760
provision like you pack a bunch of stuff

2224
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,080
and then you kind of go off on a bit of

2225
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,239
a journey and i think in the point one

2226
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,800
and the point two we may still be doing

2227
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,719
a little bit more unpacking just because

2228
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:53,760
of the

2229
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,920
the the density of this kind of

2230
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,480
information but that doesn't i mean you

2231
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,800
want to be able to do both so i think i

2232
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,719
think being able to cover

2233
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,000
this and

2234
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,080
hopefully we got it right like i

2235
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,840
i did my best to try to understand it

2236
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,440
and i think he did a good job of

2237
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,679
explaining it so we'll see who shows up

2238
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,920
in the point one and two whether the

2239
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,760
point one and two or more unpacking or

2240
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,639
maybe

2241
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,159
starting to actually

2242
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,840
think of ways that we could employ this

2243
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,600
you already mentioned that we could we

2244
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,239
can apply it to digital teams but

2245
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,440
whether or not people have the

2246
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,159
confidence to be able to take this and

2247
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,199
apply it like they've done to

2248
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,880
morphogenesis

2249
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,400
maybe that's part of that conversation

2250
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,760
cool

2251
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,880
yeah i'll be looking forward to

2252
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,360
going through with multiple

2253
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,679
concurrent regimes of attention

2254
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,120
some of the formalisms that we either um

2255
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,800
disgraced or skipped in this discussion

2256
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,840
and then keeping it open

2257
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,280
to think about

2258
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,120
morphogenesis like

2259
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,679
where has morphogenesis been in numbers

2260
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,520
1 through 38

2261
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,360
why haven't we been talking about

2262
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,400
morphogenesis and if not morphogenesis

2263
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,199
then what else have we been focusing on

2264
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:09,520
um

2265
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,880
[Music]

2266
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,199
how does it relate to embodiment

2267
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,840
and to spatial and physical aspects of

2268
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,000
cognition

2269
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,400
there's so many interesting angles

2270
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,520
and uh

2271
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,199
i'm sure we'll have a lot to discuss so

2272
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,440
dean thanks a ton for all the help on

2273
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,760
the slides and for this discussion

2274
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,090
um

2275
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:29,199
[Music]

2276
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:31,520
hope to see you in the coming weeks

2277
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,679
all right thanks daniel take care peace

2278
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,840
see you later
