"Speaker 1","00;00;27;27","00;00;52;16","All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Active Flav. Live stream number 39.2. It's March 9th. 20, 22. Welcome to the Acton flap. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on the slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;53;09","00;01;05;01","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following the video etiquette for live streams. Check out active inference, talk to learn more about anything that the lab is up to."
"Speaker 1","00;01;07;08","00;01;37;20","Today in stream number 39.2, we're in our third discussion around this paper, Morphogenesis as Bayesian inference a variational approach to pattern formation control in complex biological systems by France Kuechly, who's here with us as well as first in Georgia and Levon. So we're going to have a fun discussion in the dot to the dot zero with some background and context hopefully over viewing the paper."
"Speaker 1","00;01;38;09","00;01;59;02","The dot one, we had a discussion that opened up several threads and today we will in the dot to say hello on the introductions and then just jump in to a blank slide or to a not blank slide. So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California, and I'll pass it to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;02;01;22","00;02;23;09","I, I'm Dean, I'm in Calgary and I am going to say that I have one thing I want to look at down the road and which is how long is a person a stem cell, which I think this paper might help us pass a little bit and I'll pass it down to blue hi."
"Speaker 3","00;02;23;09","00;02;51;15","I'm blue. I'm a researcher in New Mexico. And I also, similar to Dean, have questions about when a cell becomes a cancer cell and like how does it develop its own generative model? And just in general, like when you're looking at complex systems, how these small perturbations can lead to like a totally different effect downstream, which I think is kind of related to the stem cell question that Dean has."
"Speaker 3","00;02;52;03","00;02;58;17","And I'll pass it over to the first author facts hi."
"Speaker 4","00;02;58;17","00;03;14;29","I'm France Trance. I am a student in the lab in Tufts near Boston. And I study part of my theoretical work and I do love experimental work as well, looking at information processing and organisms and cells."
"Speaker 1","00;03;19;14","00;03;35;10","So where does stubbornness or how do stem cells play into this paper and this line of research? Fraud's definitely something we've touched on, but just to kind of start generally and then we'll zoom in somewhere, so take it away sure."
"Speaker 4","00;03;36;22","00;04;10;02","The idea is that the cells initially when they're in the simulation, when they're being initialized, they have the random initialize and they have very low beliefs about what cell type they are. They can be one or four different cell types in this particular simulation, and they all share a model, a target morphology. They could achieve that they essentially are programed to achieve at some point but none of the cells, any of the cell host initially, at least not with any significant precision."
"Speaker 4","00;04;11;21","00;04;25;02","And as they move along signaling to each other and sensing each other and secreting certain types of response to each other, they then slowly, by slowly and first step, which essentially is differentiation."
"Speaker 1","00;04;30;13","00;04;54;23","So so starting with low precision about what kind of cell they believe themselves to be and then there's a process of differentiation. So DNA, any thoughts on that sort of stem to differentiated continuum? And I'll pull up an image from a non active perspective that also shows that kind of a continuum."
"Speaker 3","00;04;58;09","00;05;38;22","So I have just something to add that ties into the paper where there's aberrant signaling so a stem cell differentiates, but then during the process of customer Genesis like retains some kind of or D differentiates into something that's more similar to a stem cell than it is to a different kind of cell. And so this plasticity is important to retain look like so that we can repair cells, but also it can lead to kind of an aberrant signaling pattern yep."
"Speaker 1","00;05;39;20","00;06;07;13","Like this notion of having a terminal cell revert to a state and regain the ability of having stem. This is one of the characteristics of cancer because it can then sometimes differentiate into other cell types that are like normal and downstream of a precursor or abnormal in some other way."
"Speaker 1","00;06;12;00","00;06;12;17","How is this."
"Speaker 4","00;06;12;17","00;06;13;02","Also some."
"Speaker 1","00;06;13;22","00;06;14;10","Big difference?"
"Speaker 4","00;06;15;08","00;06;36;15","I was going to say it's also something that happens, especially in higher organisms. Right not not every organism keeps absolute stem cells and all kind populations. One example that I used to work on this and and zebrafish where you have an always developing eye and there's certain parts of the retina essentially that can be differentiated to some extent."
"Speaker 4","00;06;36;15","00;07;11;04","They're not entirely stem. So they have a stem cell need as well. But there's also, especially at an ultra high organisms, while they keep those populations of either stem cells or already differentiate sulfur can be differentiated. So it's an important part of regeneration. And ironically, this is something that's not been studied for for for one of this older research that was done where highly, highly we don't have organisms when they undergo therapies and salamanders and they injected them of carcinogens basically had saw a tumor progressing and then they caught a limp."
"Speaker 4","00;07;11;04","00;07;42;02","And this one that's highly regenerating, we actually we normalized the tumor essentially to initiation of a generation. And this organism seems to actually counteract cancer progression. And you can kind of remove the tumor, which is very interesting. And a kind of this fits a little bit into that you and this paper as well, that regeneration, right? What happens is you suddenly now have a much higher flow of information, obviously things and to we to to we differentiate."
"Speaker 4","00;07;42;19","00;08;11;14","And and that is kind of like what I was thinking as well. With the simulation after the cancer rescue phenomena where you you get you rescue this this formation of aberrant aberrant cells again signaling by having a strong contact between cells as a well, nothing more than regeneration here although you can I think the original paper call has done some weights cut I think cut off that it let it grow again."
"Speaker 4","00;08;11;15","00;08;23;03","I think that's been done in the original paper and knowing one place that's something to kind of keep in mind. This is something that that that is experimentally highly studied to an extent."
"Speaker 1","00;08;25;18","00;08;59;05","So one general note and then a question, this question, this idea that the organisms that have the highly regenerative capacity and there's a continuum from regrowing just the tail to regrowing a whole limb to kind of an extreme or highly regenerative case like the plan area that was studied in this paper. So it's all kind of on a continuum from total ability to regenerate from any adult somatic cell can fully recapitulate the full population all the way to a total opposite of that."
"Speaker 1","00;09;00;06","00;09;28;03","And then you pointed out that it might be related to cancer progressions and phenotype, and that speaks to a blue brought up about the like system level effects. There's the individual cells and there's the system level because clearly there's something about the system level in the regenerative situation that would lead to this be different, or maybe it could be explained by just something internals about anyway."
"Speaker 1","00;09;30;22","00;09;40;17","You mentioned that higher inflammation was associated with rearrangement. Could you explain a little bit about that or how does it play out in this paper? Or in general."
"Speaker 4","00;09;42;18","00;10;05;03","Yeah, it's basically the, the idea that not so much the total of content but the flow of it. And we talked about this last time, it's hard to really kind of quantify this in a more meaningful biological sense, but the idea is that it's information flow. I think Dean asks a question, like I said, more information, always good."
"Speaker 4","00;10;05;03","00;10;36;08","And my answer to that was it's, it's, it's within context of what the participant always can receive and can process. So in the sense that if you have, you know, cells that are processing certain information with a certain kind of rates, time concepts, then kind of getting information in rhythm with that time frame in mind is what what makes it more likely for them to kind of understand better their environment and react to it as opposed to a cell kind of thing."
"Speaker 4","00;10;36;12","00;11;02;23","But also cancer cells that have the whole sensory part completely perturb that to not react to the environment any more than anything. Else becomes noise and it gets ignored. That's kind of the idea. So there's there is a lot of different differences in of how the cancer cells because they have changed in profile and channel profiles have changed machinery of what they are actually transcribing."
"Speaker 4","00;11;02;23","00;11;17;19","So all of that leads to the difference in how signals are being processed and understanding that. And then reacting to that I think is a key to to understand that and treating this disease Awesome."
"Speaker 1","00;11;17;26","00;11;18;15","Thanks, Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;11;21;10","00;11;53;19","I don't know if I have the answer to that, Mike. My question, which is how long is a person to lay a finger and scarecrows a stem cell? But one of the things you mentioned bronze and the white one was I think Steven asked the question about how much volume or in the flow. And what I've heard you say back was it's always a state space dependency which which I when I'm reading the papers, I think you made a really good sound case for that."
"Speaker 2","00;11;54;00","00;12;17;00","But then one of the things that when you had to check, when you had to sign off, one of the questions that I brought up, hopefully that maybe we can discuss a little bit today is they can figure four and five of the paper, all that black area around when the sort of cells move into place. That's a crude way of describing what's going on there."
"Speaker 2","00;12;17;00","00;12;45;18","But all that black area around that Am I is it fair to say that that's kind of the the state space dependency or is it just assumed? And how would we because Daniel did a good job of sort of saying there's some invisibility aspects to this when we multi do multiple layering. And so how how do you give people a sense of what's going on in that in that black that black dot area."
"Speaker 2","00;12;45;18","00;13;13;01","Right. I think I think black is a good a good color representation because it's not really a color I don't think. But it but it kind of speaks to this idea that we've got these little beliefs, but how long or how long as a person whereas cells as a cluster of cells is that beneficial Right. Well, we're we're talking of course here under the the big umbrella of morphology."
"Speaker 2","00;13;13;10","00;13;34;19","So that was kind of where I was wondering today, maybe you could you could explain it because you the focus, the eye tends to focus on the object within the frame as opposed to sort of the area around the what we would consider to be the object. So if you can kinda help me understand this state space dependency piece."
"Speaker 4","00;13;35;26","00;14;02;08","Yeah. I mean, so if you had a biblical figure to so why didn't plot in the figure four and five and two. I did is two concentrations, right? So yeah, of course some some levels of kind of signaling molecules in the back one as well, which will also of course be the case and that in the actual simulations down the line of four and five the, the blackness."
"Speaker 4","00;14;02;08","00;14;26;29","So the one interesting part about the simulation which was done mainly for simplicity and lack of necessity, is to not actually have an external environment per say. Like there's nothing right? There's no external force outside of base. Everything in some nations is done by the cells where the cells they make the environment right is essentially the same environment by the signaling molecules that they put out."
"Speaker 4","00;14;27;14","00;14;59;29","But we don't have any external limit like limits around it. We just basically that's it's basically plot the signaling. Michael Stone go farther than that and there isn't any external force which we could do. Right. We we the how the simulations we do this asymmetry we essentially get we get sort of an implicit environment by changing the response to the signal, which you can imagine if you put something in the medium that that flips housing being processed and then that's it."
"Speaker 4","00;15;01;09","00;15;32;21","So back to your question. So this is why this blackness and when I that beneficial turns of that question correctly, it's there is of course, like a hype, like a precision component to it and kind of more less and less hand-waving if, you know, if your environment is very volatile and constantly changes and you keep but you have a nut not just the such as a closed system where if you had an open system constant, you would get second thoughts for the environment."
"Speaker 4","00;15;32;21","00;15;52;26","This will also become a lot messier and especially initially right in the in the first frames of that figure four and five. So you get the simulation two also together. I mentioned last time there are certain smoothness, requirements where like if you had to put this dampening on the sensitivity a long time. So in burst happening, it will get more sensitive with time."
"Speaker 4","00;15;53;11","00;16;13;08","But just because initially they're very unstructured, they have very low power beliefs and they will jump crazy if they have high sensitivity each other because they're in such close proximity and that is something that we do of course do some in biology, right? We did be most especially the high organ I'm sorry, they start off often, usually in closed environments."
"Speaker 4","00;16;13;23","00;16;40;01","Now of course, you can you can argue this. You don't need to call that an information stuffiness. OK, you all it's just, you know, thermally insulated. They have their own food supplies. It makes, you know, just makes like a more safe zone, like just physically energy speaking. But I do think there's a big component to it. It's like shutting this highly volatile, you know, itself and firing organism off from inputs from the environment at a stage when all these cells are figuring out what to do each other."
"Speaker 4","00;16;40;15","00;17;04;22","So they need they kind of need to have a kind of a barrier between signals from the environments which normally, you know, to us adults and in between a mature organism are not really dangerous. But to end developing organism full of stem cells can be problematic and will basically would would perturb its natural progression in this state space to almost sulfate acquisition."
"Speaker 4","00;17;05;21","00;17;30;23","There is a cool paper I can reference to you from Chris Fields, who I am from Disclosure. I'm working with him very much admire him who wrote a paper about multicellularity, and that's exactly the consequence of what I'm talking about. I said the multi celebrity basically emerging in as a way to shut down cells, cells that are an initial evolution of motor celerity."
"Speaker 4","00;17;31;06","00;18;11;27","So it's not going through an evolution to us complexity, needing some kind of barrier from the environment, basically making themselves making, creating a model bank around them that makes it so they're not constantly being perturbed by the environment. And that's the idea of, of how one would slow to motion in first place is to insulate niches which would become stem cell niches from the environment, so that cells that are undergoing, you know, very, very dynamic changes in short of time that therefore need to be sensitive to the environment cannot be need to be isolated from influencing the environment that would perturb this careful inference of cell type."
"Speaker 1","00;18;14;01","00;18;14;23","Things, steam."
"Speaker 2","00;18;16;28","00;18;42;25","Yeah. So in this in this figure too, you can see that there's we're talking about ranges because we've got values on the horizontal and the vertical sides of the box. So so one of the things that I think is really interesting is that once you cells you we've all spelled it out. If we're dealing with active inference, we want to avoid something surprising."
"Speaker 2","00;18;42;25","00;19;19;21","Right? The whole the whole variational aspect of this. So again, if we're talking about going from something that is has low beliefs to something that gains in I'll say gains in sensitivity without hopefully killing. What I want to say next, if if it's a boat signal adaptation to these top down two conditions which influence the final form taken, is there some way, based on what you researched with this paper, is there some way to know as you're approaching that place of energy exhaustion?"
"Speaker 2","00;19;20;02","00;19;45;19","Like is there something that the cell tells you that it's it's finding this too surprising? Because one of the things we again, we talked about was that rate of change being so rapid, say like the U.N. report on global warming where we simply don't have the refinery to be able to adapt. Is there something that you found out through this paper that kind of said to you as you were looking at these things oh, wait a second here."
"Speaker 2","00;19;45;19","00;19;54;29","We're just going to we're going we're not our intent is not to kill this thing off, but we're approaching that place where the environment is just to changing too fast."
"Speaker 4","00;19;57;03","00;20;16;15","Yeah, I'm trying to give you a more data answer than hand-waving. Yes. But that was the general answer first. So, yes, you do it. You can you can like one way you can quickly see it. Isn't that kind of like something that you get with the prediction or a plot that you all set with the free energy plot?"
"Speaker 4","00;20;16;15","00;20;49;02","If you write in a perfect world, you will get like a nice move like exponential decay of the energy function. If that keeps changing, bouncing up and down, that will be very problematic. I did some simulations afterward. We're not included in this paper, but based on exactly the same stuff where I was including a time on top of this time sensitivity, you know, increase that I use for basically, you know, increased intensity all over the time."
"Speaker 4","00;20;49;02","00;21;15;12","But having that low in the beginning. On top of that, it put in a pulsing like a sinusoidal or a rectangular function, which was we were just trying to simulate what I'm doing. And my and my experiments in the lab were basically held certain signaling inputs to my organisms. And I wanted to see basically if I randomized that or met that in a certain certain pattern, how well with the simulations still be able to cope with that."
"Speaker 4","00;21;15;12","00;21;48;16","And and in the case where I had like a nice regular pattern of that in their free energy and efficient decay, you hardly saw that, you know, initially initially when minutes energy was very high, it was not you couldn't see it there. There was like a big jump in this and fuzziness, you could say also. And, and the belief updates, you know, the basically there were they kind of emerged kind of like diverged initially very strongly and diverge in terms of their beliefs that they had about themselves."
"Speaker 4","00;21;48;27","00;22;24;05","But then kind of off towards the when the sensitivity overall was kind of acclimating. But was kind of varying around this acclimation point. You didn't see that much anymore in the in the regular pattern, but the ones were less regular that was very much perturb and and found you also didn't actually quite did not only did it not come to kind of like to this asymptotic behavior but actually started increasing and then basically you just was really protected and you didn't see that."
"Speaker 4","00;22;24;05","00;22;57;05","So change a question like how do you see if if you are not adapting correctly even though you don't actually know yet what what the what you actually see as I would answer it, how much are you switching back and forth between your beliefs and I guess more precisely, also like how certain are you off that? Right. This is something that we talk about metacognition, which recently from a lot of people have been getting into and reading about metacognition that in rats and primates, other animals."
"Speaker 4","00;22;57;05","00;23;30;21","And the first step to metacognition, this, as far as I understand it, is having a certain confidence about your results. So they have rats where they basically gave rats the option. And this kind of cognitive task that they could also just not answer that tastic, not to not push those levers for the task, but it was base levers and they had the option to not push a lever for which they would get a lower reward than if they a much lower what if they got it correctly, but more than if they got it wrongly."
"Speaker 4","00;23;31;03","00;23;50;06","And so what they saw is that they actually would and in certain cases, when they hadn't learned when they hadn't learned the task correctly, they would just not push the lever. And that is used as like a first hand sense off of the metacognition, that sense of they must have been unsure about what to do and chose not to do it."
"Speaker 4","00;23;50;24","00;24;13;01","So I think that's kind of like if you it's one thing if you kind of lean back and forth because you always think, well, you know, and this and that being unsure is normal, but kind of a kind of constantly going back and forth between certain states of of sureness is also problematic. So that's the generalized answer to this."
"Speaker 2","00;24;15;02","00;24;35;17","I think I think the interesting thing there is the emphasis on the back and forth. Metaphorically speaking, we tend to give a lot of attention over to the balance piece. But like what you're talking about when you're talking about the environment is not the plank as much as a moving fulcrum. So how do you how do you adjust right."
"Speaker 2","00;24;36;07","00;24;54;20","The balance, I guess, is the is the outcome, but it's the the process itself is the back and forth. So, yeah, I wondered about that because some things you do want from like from an epigenetic standpoint, you do want certain cells to die. You want their energy to expire."
"Speaker 4","00;24;55;03","00;24;55;27","Absolutely. I mean."
"Speaker 2","00;24;56;04","00;25;06;05","Right. That's part of the back forth as opposed to the balance. You know, there's no balance metaphor. You want there, you want them to die and they're not dying. So that's really interesting. Thank you."
"Speaker 4","00;25;07;29","00;25;35;18","I wanted to add 11 more kind of an attempt to answer more specifically, is this paper by I'm probably parents in the same room truthfully, but was it just Google of and an active inference? They basically looked at, you know, a balance in terms of like judging if your actions, you know, so like are they better or worse basically, is that are you assigning a sign positive or negative to two outcomes?"
"Speaker 4","00;25;36;18","00;26;07;02","And they were doing that and that two different schemas and they were defining a you know, there's other definitions my one was going to be about this, but they were looking at it and that been schema about the rate of change. They were looking at the first and second order evidence of how or I'm saying this correctly about how the time beliefs were updated to the precision, how important they how how sure they were, but what cell type there were."
"Speaker 4","00;26;07;14","00;26;39;29","And so basically in the second order derivative, basically how much would they change at any given time? In their beliefs? That's what they would they plucked in balance and to differ, that gets more complex than that. But that's the gist of it. So that I think is a in the within the family and friends to some like with regards to a question that look at the rate of change by which your beliefs are updating and with respect to uncertainty, you have, of course, just this whole course written about this as well."
"Speaker 4","00;26;40;13","00;27;04;19","I have as well a poem about I'm one of You is that stress make stress sensing mechanisms like stress as a universal driver in biology. It's actually much more important than rewards that can. I find that we always talk about rewards, but biology is much more focused on on stress. One form different it's more important to deal with and then the what maximizing question."
"Speaker 4","00;27;04;19","00;27;42;08","I always say it's just the negative. But the point of being is stress as a as in terms of uncertainty like not having not minimizing your energy effectively and stably, that will lead to stress. And this paper that just in humans I think I mentioned last time as well with the two experiments with humans and mice as well with ethical where they with the gift that the electric shocks, I think the data both from mice and humans and then they showed that they were more stressed out not just by this later shocks themselves but they couldn't predict right electric shock."
"Speaker 4","00;27;42;08","00;28;02;17","So it's the uncertainty of what coming next I think that is the most if I had to say one thing that is most they go off of you're going in a bad place. So if you are stressed because you have no idea what's happening and you cannot even if you know something bad is going to happen, you know when it's happening, that's a lot less bad than if you don't know at all."
"Speaker 4","00;28;03;27","00;28;25;20","One last really dark example to really make. It's a dark place is there is I'm from I was born in East Germany. I guess I was on newly opened a wall fell so but we know my parents were very much and there was this now it's a museum but it was a prison for the basic political detainees and East Germany and Poland."
"Speaker 4","00;28;26;11","00;28;51;10","And we went there as a class once and they showed us all the thing all the techniques they used to interrogate prisoners including torture. And one of the torture devices was, I believe, a Japanese device where you would it's free to you put your head down on this device and there's the water that's dropping from the top onto your neck so you think at this point like that doesn't sound about right."
"Speaker 4","00;28;51;26","00;29;16;06","The problem was, is that the drops, you know, this this lives classically in this kind of fluctuations so the drops wouldn't always come at the same time and a ripple happening or time and time again. So what the and the prisoners actually that people are used to prison. They actually went on giving the tour. So they were telling us, yeah, if you want a device after a couple of hours or so, these drops will feel like hammers on your on your neck."
"Speaker 4","00;29;16;27","00;29;44;17","And apparently a big component of that was the not the body not being able to adapt to it because, you know, the drops don't come at a perfect five segment level it happens kind of at some twice randomized into volts. So that I think that's a huge part and not just looking at stress all the time, but how you conduct that stress and how to adapt to stress."
"Speaker 4","00;29;44;17","00;30;21;27","Adaptation to me always involves a component prediction if you can't predict the source of the stress when it happens, it makes things a lot worse. That has been shown extensively in humans and also and lower organisms and I believe very strongly that there's something fundamental to any biological system to fundamental growth. If you if you if you if you prescribed scratch to the point of view that minimizing uncertainty and environment is a fundamental drive of life, then before that you describe that minimizing stress and the source of stress over time and being able to predict it is also fundamental."
"Speaker 4","00;30;22;07","00;30;29;11","And lactose makes a very dangerous system blue."
"Speaker 3","00;30;29;21","00;30;55;03","Thanks so all that's super interesting. Just OK, so let me I'm going to start at the front and work backwards. So in terms of uncertainty and how that causes stress, I'm really kind of, I don't know, reluctant to use the word stress in a biological system. Like I think about stressing a biological system is like pushing it out of equilibrium."
"Speaker 3","00;30;57;06","00;31;25;26","But but maybe that's just stimulus, right? Like, I want you to rebalance and go to like a new equilibrium like or like turn on heat shock protein or, you know, there's a variety of different things. Like many ways you can use stress as a stimulus to do something new or to perturb the system in a new way. But but in terms of uncertainty, I think that there's a lot of truth in how uncomfortable people are with uncertainty at a cognitive level."
"Speaker 3","00;31;25;26","00;31;46;25","And you can even see it like in the stock market before, like the election is in before the election results, like the stock market goes crazy. And because nobody knows, I mean, it's not that one candidate is preferable over the other, but it's just the unknowing. It's very like people freak out. So so and that speaks, I think, to metacognition also."
"Speaker 3","00;31;47;20","00;32;11;01","And then so I wanted to back up a little bit, if I can, to your discussion of infamy. Ocean flow and how that might be difficult to quantify. And Daniel, I don't know. Can you flip to the section for me, please, on the generalized flow section? I think we started to get into that a little bit last week and we did discuss it in the zero."
"Speaker 3","00;32;11;01","00;32;38;17","But I have I know that this is very mathematically technical, and so I just have a little bit of questions about this, and maybe you can help explain it in a way that's perhaps less technical, but specifically information flow. And Chris Fields is coming to discuss the FPP four generic quantum systems next week. And so I can similarly interrogate him about about some of this stuff, and I'm looking forward to it."
"Speaker 3","00;32;38;17","00;33;07;12","But, you know, we have a discussion there's a discussion in the paper about the probability flow and information of a probability current, I think is actually what is used and getting into information currents like if you look up what is an information current, I think there's like the idea of the von Neumann information current and that like is explicitly related to quantum systems."
"Speaker 3","00;33;07;21","00;33;36;07","So is there any similar like do we have a way to measure information? Correct. Because even when Mike came to the livestream and talked about expanding cognition, biological cognition, computational boundary was out there. It was so. But when you expand biological cognition like there's you know, you're basically expanding your informational awareness. And so is there anything like an information current or how can you best relate that within a biological system?"
"Speaker 3","00;33;36;07","00;33;42;28","Is it like an expansion of your computational boundary or does it look like just more information goes in and comes out."
"Speaker 4","00;33;46;16","00;34;18;06","I think it's it depends on what level you're looking at. I would say it's both. So the the the second part you mentioned about the information to a comes in to something we just have more access to biologically speaking mentally. Right. And you could absolutely you know, you can you can look at you know, you have all these sensors for four, four senses receptors being activated for genetic transcription and response to that."
"Speaker 4","00;34;18;06","00;34;58;07","So so that's something that we can have best chance of quantifying experimentally. And in terms of computationally it's something can monitor. And then also couple that crystal thing you mentioned that and I can let him that's basically what what he's also very interested in. Right how how does physical energy of course plate all all into this and about the metabolism right now this comes for free that's something that biologists often kind of mothballed is actually know theatrical biology just off the cuff and under the table because the idea is that energy is abundant and in life, which is true."
"Speaker 4","00;34;58;07","00;35;22;26","That's true. Right. There's plenty of sunlight. That's plenty of things to put around. But at the same time, locally, just with entropy, it is a strong competition. So just because you are living in a reservoir that has plenty of food and sunlight, that doesn't mean that you locally are going to going to survive because there's people locally competing with you the same is true, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;35;22;26","00;35;55;09","I mean, this is always like when you talk to touch of people that, you know, have problems. The idea of what why does entropy I don't want to say names, but if you that saying that entropy is always increase, chaos in the universe increases, how do we see much more structure evolving? And then the quasi answer to that is that, well, just taking a bite of water, if you have said not all droplets are going to come together because overall that makes that lot gives more degrees of freedom for all the water molecules."
"Speaker 4","00;35;55;09","00;36;16;21","So the entirety entire system actually did increase. But you manage to find a solution that does increase that, but locally created clean water, that's the dry off I think, off of life overall. The quote that probably the talk that got me into biology, this was from a biophysicist in Heidelberg was saying life is not about energy. It's entropy."
"Speaker 4","00;36;18;15","00;36;43;15","But the two come together, right? Yes. It's about how much information is available. But then by extent of that, once you scratch that, once you have to form these local structures, then energy becomes important again. So and that's what I think is needed right now when you have these highly, highly spatially organized systems, energy suddenly does become something that is valuable again."
"Speaker 4","00;36;46;27","00;37;10;07","Yeah, I think I kind of lost my train of thought there. The the banner yourself. That's right. The information flow that was part of the information flow can measure that have good ideas. What was lacking is a quantum understanding of of of how metabolism is really hooked into the information flow, whether or not it's built into the model over that's ad hoc just down down the line."
"Speaker 4","00;37;10;07","00;37;30;24","You give it certain resources and after a while it just exports them the bound yourself is interesting because of course in the cell we think, well, we have a, you know, there's a membrane, the body of the cell, pathetic, fairly obvious. It's easier for us to think. And of course, if you look at two multicellular organisms comes, you know, tissue skill, then that becomes a lot more difficult."
"Speaker 4","00;37;30;24","00;37;57;12","But even on a cellular level, if you have certain receptors, you know, you have certain activations of it, then at immortality, you don't just in the active inference scheme, but especially in that scheme, you also you'd have a model of yourself. Right? And at what point your own your own what you secreting out on own and your signals that you secrete also feed feedback into what you're sensing at all."
"Speaker 4","00;37;58;00","00;38;22;25","So it is kind of thought that that's that whole system is very much perturbed in cancer cells as well. Where the how much is it is are you actually receiving things from the environment? Are you basically just secreting and secreting and you don't really anymore. So the the bounty of self what Mike was talking about, the fuel, we have been much more economic can be about this."
"Speaker 4","00;38;22;25","00;38;53;19","But the idea is the bonus health is encoded specifically with time and spatial constraints like how much you're burning the self what you ask yourself might be more general about this yourself model depends very much on your sense your your sensory memory like how how far do you sense and how and spatially how much riding can you sense and how much that you have encoded as memory, how much affects in the past persisting so that you know."
"Speaker 4","00;38;53;19","00;39;15;18","So even though if you have a cell that's said membrane, is it that cell does not actually keep any track. If that cell is not somehow sensing beyond a certain boundary and then it creates on on bound by these hyper cells that are based then surrounding themselves with each other and suddenly that environment becomes mute. So the boundary of the self has essentially expanded."
"Speaker 4","00;39;15;18","00;39;25;02","I would argue that I think that's kind of the, the, the thought train here. I hope that I was somewhat able to answer question."
"Speaker 1","00;39;25;27","00;39;26;10","Awesome."
"Speaker 3","00;39;27;18","00;39;40;06","So just I was curious you mentioned that there was a talk that got you hooked into biology. Was it Eric Smith and his discussion of biology and entropy? Because that's also fabulous."
"Speaker 4","00;39;40;22","00;40;02;03","It was not. I'm just saying that no. Was the person that I don't remember. No, the name of the person that got me into biology is I was the English flight engineer and back then and I was kind of my brain then has problems switching between those two in content as well as language. I'll come back to Mitch probably within this talk."
"Speaker 3","00;40;02;25","00;40;10;26","Eric Smith does a wonderful job, though, of, you know, discussing biology in terms of entropy. And so if you are not familiar with this work, I would just highly recommend it."
"Speaker 4","00;40;11;02","00;40;11;10","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;40;12;21","00;40;47;18","That really reflects on our discussion. What parts of the self model are important to carry forward and then what are the affordances for direct and indirect self modification? So that's one piece. Like you mentioned, the auto screen signaling, and that's not even a contentious component. It just is being modeled in a different way with active inference rather than just a molecular event that's happening that like a cells secrete molecules that they also possess receptors to measure."
"Speaker 1","00;40;47;27","00;41;23;00","It's just putting that into a framework of reflexive self modeling and stigma and niche modification. Here but just one other point that I thought was really maybe useful to highlight was this sensitivity. And just like many of the terms in acting for a kind of seeing that there is a narrow or quantitative sense, and then there's a broader sense because in any dynamical systems model, you might hear about sensitivity of the parameter, which is how much changing that parameter changes the outcome of the system."
"Speaker 1","00;41;23;17","00;42;03;12","And so that's a quantitative sense and then also it was brought up that it's important to model these like second order derivatives, like how fast are things changing relative to expectation mutations or how fast are they changing, how they're changing? And that is what the generalized flow is, is all those higher derivatives so we can use that quantitative sense of sensitivity to look at how parameter changes in the generalized coordinates of motion matter but also we can perhaps with cognitive modeling, take this discussion of sensitivity in the way that people are usually meaning it."
"Speaker 1","00;42;03;28","00;42;53;26","Like sensitivity of what is seen on someone's emotional state, and then model that using cognitive parameters like valence and affect, even though that's quite a disjoint use from the parameter sensitivity discussion on the generalized coordinates. So it's was an awesome discussion with like what is stress and how does that relate to the parametric sort of neutral perspective on what stress or sensitivity, what might mean just the model descriptive versus some of these functional or or phenomenological even ways that these terms come into play blue."
"Speaker 3","00;42;55;27","00;43;27;21","So that's super interesting thinking about sensitivity and stress and just in terms of cognition, right? So I know people that have sensory processing disorders get like super aggravated by something like a bright light or like a windy day. And just how how sensitivity does play into maybe the flow of, of information like because, you know, I'm suddenly sensitive to this and I'm also sensitized to every other thing in my environment, like someone's screaming over here and it's windy and it's hot and it's bright."
"Speaker 3","00;43;27;21","00;43;51;27","And then like I become just so overstimulated rightly, people have these, these processing things and it's sensory is that something that has momentum? Right. So you have enhanced sensitivity and is that just like then all of a sudden you're just you're so sensitive, like you hear people say stuff like that, like you stop being so sensitive. I'm just in terms of cognitive processing, I thought that that was just super interesting."
"Speaker 4","00;43;54;06","00;44;17;08","I think that's an excellent point. I mean, that's something that that that shows exactly how important it is for humans. I argue low levels as well. And in the evolution to be able to model our sensitivity to change all sensitivity. Right. We would never be able to have conversations in low environments if we couldn't change consciously our and sometimes subconsciously as well our sensitivity parameters."
"Speaker 4","00;44;17;08","00;44;47;18","And I think that's something else that also feeds into metacognition. What you'll learn like, oh, well, I not paying attention, not having to pay more attention to you trying to tune this in. And I think that's the sense of on the cell level. I think what where that fits in as the is by learning over time how much are being how many receptors are being activated, how does that feed in downstream."
"Speaker 4","00;44;48;00","00;45;11;14","Then there's this component where essentially the cell can update sensitivity by expressing more receptors by even if it's not in a sense it's it's it's inputs, it can increase those proteins so responsible for sensing these things. And that's also different. If you talk about ion channels that we work with that there are different versions of ion channels that have different rate constants."
"Speaker 4","00;45;12;10","00;45;50;27","The same is true for the actual for active proteins as well for pumps. So that becomes then a lot more explicitly modulating sensitivity over time and that way to um, to, you know, better react and cope with adapt to its environment. Again, adaptation, keep in mind involves prediction and in most cases, if not explicitly, then implicitly awesome. And by the way, you guys may Grossman and Heidelberg before I turn them on my great oh that was the first I'm coming to physics to biology biophysics."
"Speaker 1","00;45;52;16","00;46;38;13","Cool just to kind of connect that change in sensitivity to some of those mechanisms. So if it's the sensitivity to a given hormone or a given circulating molecule, then that sometimes gets accomplished biologically by changes in like the membrane receptor density or changes in downstream signaling pathways. So even if the amount of receptor in the membrane stays constant, it's like you can release more of the neurotransmitter in the synapse, or you could have more or less receptors or you could have more or less of all of these regulators and phosphorylated proteins, et cetera, in the downstream signaling pathways, because there's a lot of complexity in that space, but there's a lot of knobs including rates"
"Speaker 1","00;46;38;13","00;47;14;13","of change and rates of rates of change and lag effects with transcription factors and all this other basically any thing is possible. And then at the organism level, just to give one than anyone else, maybe at some other level, like it's kind of like a nest. We aren't being sensitive to interactions. And then a nurse who's a younger ants is like initially more susceptible or more sensitive due to multiple reasons like at the antenna, at the brain in just spatially where the nurse is."
"Speaker 1","00;47;14;20","00;47;43;12","And then there's this development towards being a forager, being sensitive to forager cues, finding oneself in spaces where there are foraging cues that are useful so there's a lot of ways that these changes in the type of sensitivity again are already things that we talk about in developing until biology. And so it's so cool to see how that is connected to the molecular mechanism, the affective angle."
"Speaker 1","00;47;43;22","00;47;53;24","And then with the underpinning of the generalized flow the idea."
"Speaker 2","00;47;56;02","00;48;31;25","So you guys can push, push back on this hard if you want. But it's interesting, I one of the terms that I coined was that stress programing or at least programing with stress assumed was basically learning either formally or informally. That's what it is. Because there's a certain amount of stress, albeit positive or negative. But I kind of threw that through that viewfinder I think it's interesting that back to the back and forth thing, stress programing can be safer or it can be riskier."
"Speaker 2","00;48;32;16","00;49;04;15","And, you know, as long as it's not sort of killing the learner, if safer in the sense of as intervention, I think this paper showed that you can intervene but riskier is as distribution, like sending something out into the unknown. It can be safer as teaching or taught it can also be riskier as I'm teaching or untaught sort of just sort of throwing somebody into a situation and see whether they can paddle or not."
"Speaker 2","00;49;06;08","00;49;43;20","The last thing is, can also be seen as post modeling in the safer sense because we reduce some of the variation or it can also be riskier as in terms of coordinating meaning the person has to kind of figure it out as they're flying the plane so I wonder what you guys think. Do you think that can we is there some agreement that learning in general be it formalized or in formalized, has has an aspect of stress programing that kind of is assumed or from way, way out."
"Speaker 1","00;49;47;10","00;49;52;29","The awesome question, Blue or France, what do you think."
"Speaker 4","00;49;55;28","00;50;20;22","I don't think you're off. It's there's definitely of course that the explicit and corporations are stressing to learning. But your question I think is like is it is kind of always implicitly there even if not explicitly so one interesting kind of discursive blue mentioned earlier that stress can be interpreted as like some oppressive stress hormones call it just be like subjugation from from equilibrium from homeostasis."
"Speaker 4","00;50;21;21","00;50;55;25","And they actually do kind of this has been breached. This has been combined and homeostatic enforcement learning where they kind of implicitly, explicitly make the reward and reward based reinforcement learning about the homeostatic off point. And then stress becomes suddenly a lot more explicit in that sense of perturbation from from your homeostatic set point in the in the act of inference, skim stress is basically just your you could just define it basically as your overall difference."
"Speaker 4","00;50;55;25","00;51;24;13","And again, like with balance, I was talking about like how much is this your belief certainty changing? Are you minimizing uncertainty year over time or not? It is it is hard. I think it's hard. It's hard both to complete the year say stress is not involved and the doubt saying that, well, you just calling everything stress. But it kind of it's really it depends on what how you define stress."
"Speaker 4","00;51;24;13","00;52;01;08","But if you think if you go off school, if something like as in like stress as you're not right now and you've been in my state, you're not in an actual game or you're not and you homicide except point and in a more basic scene then stress is I would argue ubiquitous in learning. Yes because without that, if we don't have the difference to that, if you don't actually if you don't have any drive to learn because you're not you know, you think you're everything's perfect then it's hard to to have a learning or specifically learning as about with the environment and context."
"Speaker 4","00;52;01;08","00;52;16;24","What is your what are you going to go by trying to adapt to it as a train to learning and sense of like adapt to it and find a certain equilibrium with it. Then I think stress becomes very much explicit and it's ubiquitous in learning."
"Speaker 2","00;52;19;16","00;52;41;24","OK, I just want to add one thing and that's perfect because I always talk about the minimum of two. And I think you're I think you're absolutely right friends. I think you have to then look at stress as being either voluntary or involuntary. I think that's the minimum of two that you have to look at because I think if you have voluntary stress, it's it's it's measurably different than the involuntary type."
"Speaker 2","00;52;42;19","00;53;08;28","So yeah, you're right. I don't think it's I don't think we can just throw everything under one umbrella and make it a monolith. I think we have to partition it right from the very get go and say all programing, be it a curriculum, whatever, whatever the curriculum, is that that those stem cells have, that's some of it's going to be voluntary and some of it's going to be involuntary based on their situation that they're they're placed in."
"Speaker 2","00;53;09;14","00;53;20;15","So again, I wasn't trying to pull that direction, but I didn't bring up stress. But I really like that it was brought up so."
"Speaker 1","00;53;20;15","00;53;21;05","OK, yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;53;22;16","00;53;47;00","So so just from a nurse science perspective, it's interesting, like the voluntary involuntary stress thing is so different. And I feel like maybe Daniela, remember we discussed that at some point like when you're exposed to a stress that like you do to yourself on purpose, like you're strength training or something like that versus, you know, some, some externally imposed stress that you didn't volunteer for."
"Speaker 3","00;53;47;05","00;54;14;08","I think that that has a difference in affect. I feel like we looked at a paper. I can't remember stuff in my head, though, but in terms of sensory processing, it's really interesting. In neuroscience, we actually adapt, right? So so you can listen to like you, this is a great example. If you turn on the car radio and like you're listening jamming out in the car for, I don't know, a while, 20 minutes, 30 minutes and then suddenly it doesn't seem as loud."
"Speaker 3","00;54;14;14","00;54;31;14","And so you turn it up and then you're jamming out, jamming out, German out, and still it doesn't seem as loud. So you turn it up because the same level of stimulus produces a decreasing sensation and that's true in terms of, you know, visual, like when you first time the leg, you're like, oh, it's so bright, but then you adapt."
"Speaker 3","00;54;31;21","00;54;54;28","And so in terms of sensory processing, we have a mechanism for adaptation. And I wonder about actually cells like not neurons because it's like I'm specifically talking about like a sensory processing way, but I wonder if cells do the same thing. I mean, I guess like, you know, the receptors shuts or the receptors triggered and then it can't get activated again for some certain amount of time."
"Speaker 3","00;54;54;28","00;55;25;14","So even just receptor binding in and of itself is like an adaptation mechanism. Like you can't constantly like dump the chemical into the receptor, open the channel or whatever. Like that's not like biochemically possible. But but I wonder if, you know, cells have some other adaptation mechanism outside of this like channel opening or closing or just this is there more than like the mechanical dynamics of the channel that enables cellular adaptation."
"Speaker 4","00;55;29;23","00;55;49;20","I can think of a couple of ones that but no one expert on this. But yes, you could think of course, on the on the epigenetic level, if you basically just know that the equipment is still on base, you have a more tightly packed chromosome, you're going to have less genetic expression no matter what kind of signaling input you get to the nucleus."
"Speaker 4","00;55;50;07","00;56;13;01","That's whenever I can think of it. Another one is mechanically so the right. And most of the I hope I'm not overgeneralizing, but I think most of the, you know, signaling that comes that that receptors are sensing and then has to be transported to the nucleus somehow to to cause transcription that is usually directed right there has to correct across cytoskeleton."
"Speaker 4","00;56;13;12","00;56;52;24","So if you change the mechanical properties of the first Kelvin itself and now again I'm out of my league, but that's a microwave almost an awesome one. That's my spot on that topic. Lastly, it's if you talk to cell intracellular context then you know things like, you know what we know and you all know context. You have these the synapses in the nonunion context, you still have gap junctions and other complexes that allow transport between cells and those can also be modulated by the cell."
"Speaker 4","00;56;52;24","00;57;09;29","So then there you can also get habituation and definitely not examples where people are shown habituation and even other this act active research on, on, on showing that there's more to situation but also actually to learning of of certain patterns as well. I think that's true."
"Speaker 3","00;57;10;16","00;57;36;22","So I'm really interested in the so skeleton because a lot of you know, I mean the receptors are in the membrane embedded in the membrane, but we don't really there's not a lot of work that looks at the side of skeletal dynamics with respect to like modulation of receptor dynamics. Right. Right. So that's a field that I think I haven't seen very much work in terms of how does the underlying cytoskeleton contribute."
