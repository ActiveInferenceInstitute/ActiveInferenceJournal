"Speaker 1","00;00;27;18","00;00;56;13","All right. Hello. Welcome to Active Flower. Lifestream number 39.1. It's March 2nd. 20. 22. Welcome to the Acton flap. We're a participatory lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference This is recorded in an archived live stream. Please provide feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll follow good video etiquette for live streams."
"Speaker 1","00;00;57;23","00;01;32;19","To learn more about Acton Lab, go to active inference dot org We're here in active stream number 39.1. And we are learning and discussing this paper Morphogenesis as Bayesian Inference a variational approach to pattern formation and control in complex biological systems by couching first in your give and 11 from 20, 20 and we had a fun dot zero and time probably all individually going through the paper pretty much in 39 one."
"Speaker 1","00;01;32;19","00;01;53;17","We'll just kind of go over introductions and then can go to a blank page and just see where especially Steven and Blue want to raise any questions and also anyone can ask in the live shot. OK so we'll just do introduction. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California and I'll pass it to live."
"Speaker 2","00;01;57;00","00;02;02;01","I'm blue, I'm a researcher in New Mexico and I will pass it to Stiller."
"Speaker 3","00;02;03;16","00;02;19;08","Hello, I'm Steven Celente. I'm based in Toronto. I'm a server action researcher and practitioner in community development and participatory theater and I will pass it to Dean Good morning."
"Speaker 4","00;02;19;08","00;02;21;02","I'm Dean. I'm here in Calgary."
"Speaker 4","00;02;23;12","00;02;41;26","And not much to say other than I'm kind of looking forward to hearing what the Blue and Stephen have to add to this. This rather big math question and how that fits with morphology. So back to you, Dan, OK."
"Speaker 1","00;02;43;22","00;03;08;24","Well, if anyone wants to start with a specific question or figure or we can review just sort of the main points of the paper, like let's look at the roadmap. So what section where people like to enter in or have a question or idea related to or we can just go in."
"Speaker 4","00;03;10;27","00;03;35;17","So you wanted to talk about this and I wanted to talk about this. And it was it was this all section on the list action principle, which I think we both find quite interesting because. Yeah, why? And it led me to the question of is there is there something efficient about search, pull over somebody sort of passing along and sharing."
"Speaker 4","00;03;35;29","00;03;49;23","So I'm kind of curious what people think of that in terms of the math and the morphology all right."
"Speaker 1","00;03;50;04","00;03;54;16","This action, math morphology."
"Speaker 3","00;03;55;28","00;04;24;11","Stephen Yeah, I, I never could unpack a little bit more what they were saying there. I'm, I'm interested in some of the implications of that work around looking at the math and morphology as it scales from these what you might call smaller scales and we can already perceive often what's going on with morphogenesis is not something we can be consciously aware of a lot of the time."
"Speaker 3","00;04;24;11","00;05;07;15","However, who we are is built upon morphogenesis. So I'm very curious around how some of these first principles can be thought of as rolling now so we can talk about this action as being one way of approaching it, where people often think about and energy and efficiency of energy processes as being the root that everything will take, the more informational Asian influence, which is and learning that is implied by this without sort of distracting from the paper."
"Speaker 3","00;05;07;15","00;05;19;10","I'm curious about people's thoughts about what sort of implications that has for thinking about these bottom up ways of knowing."
"Speaker 1","00;05;27;21","00;05;28;12","OK, blue."
"Speaker 2","00;05;30;19","00;06;09;19","So I have some questions going back even to before this section in the paper talking about generalized flow. And it's really interesting just in light of the paper that's coming up in number 40 but but here in it, we see that this is like a spatial like we're talking about spatial motion here or like the foundation for the way that they model morphogenesis is, you know, positions of particles through space and time."
"Speaker 2","00;06;10;05","00;06;43;20","And I just I just wonder, like we have a time evolution here and we're talking about motion in space, but could we do the reverse and talk about like a space evolution in terms of time, like in terms of like can we invert space and time here? So that's just it's something that I was curious about if it's possible or mathematically illegal or why am I even thinking like that?"
"Speaker 2","00;06;43;20","00;07;32;24","I don't know. And another question that I had you guys were really talking about, um, you know, the, the, in the generalized flow, we talked about the equations of motions, coordinates of motion, and the derivatives and something that I saw in the paper specifically at Equation 15 that I've not seen before is p with the dot and it was not defined in the paper P with a dot, but I'm assuming it's the first derivative of P and I just thought that that was interesting so it's the probability density, but is it the derivative of the probability density with respect to X with the tilde, or is it just picked out because X had the tilde"
"Speaker 2","00;07;35;17","00;07;38;08","anyway? That's my, my question."
"Speaker 1","00;07;38;08","00;08;27;12","There all right. Well, well, we have a lot kind of on the table I think the thing blue appended with generalized flow is a good entry point because this is sort of what the systems state evolution is. And in livestream number 26 with Bayesian mechanics, we also talked about the generalized coordinates of motion with relationship with control. So it's kind of like a thermometer cybernet OK model, if you only have the position of the temperature, there's certain strategies that can be applied."
"Speaker 1","00;08;27;13","00;08;56;19","Given that modeling just simply the temperature. And then if you are modeling progressively higher and higher levels of how the system changes, it's kind of like a Taylor series. It equates to basically a better depth of control and then part of the hard part is that because over the time course that action is being planned for even hypothetically changes in like the unknown consequences of one's action complicate the estimation of different policies."
"Speaker 1","00;08;57;02","00;09;23;15","So this is just not like a total perfect way to roll out the system and understand how it's going to happen, but it gives like approximation terms to higher and higher levels of the system changing. And so that's the end. All of the levels of analysis are being linked to each other by being derivatives of each other. So then some stationary like is capped out at some point, so the derivative becomes zero."
"Speaker 1","00;09;23;27","00;10;08;06","And then that's like a Harris Stickley approximate able depth of that model. So that's just like one note of what is being estimated on. So it's like temperature and it's higher order components in some either analytical, kind of infinite, generalized way or just more practically with some smaller realization and then the dot is like a derivative pretty sure to blue, like it's like a prime, like prime prime for double derivative, two dots for two derivatives and then morphogenesis is like position of particles here."
"Speaker 1","00;10;08;06","00;10;38;28","It's like the cell body or the cell nuclei or the center of gravity of something. And then those are spatially moving. So that's the lowest level of this chain of the integrator chain with the generalized coordinates of motion. So that's how it's from a Bayesian mechanics getting to morphogenesis, which is how particles are moving in space. But instead of just modeling like their X in their Y, it's like X and Y and the higher level derivatives."
"Speaker 1","00;10;40;29","00;11;21;01","So that's the developmental motion of particles just to summarize that part, before the space of time. OK, any thoughts on that? Because the generalized flows definitely where whatever least action is, is going to be based in OK, so then let's just look at that formulas here is the derivatives. OK, anything on this? Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;11;21;23","00;11;32;06","So if you're going to look at the at the formalism, did you pull it up here? Yeah. Yeah. Generalized theta so go ahead and then I'll interject where just."
"Speaker 1","00;11;32;13","00;11;41;20","Yeah, here's 2.2.1 x tilde is the total blur of all the dots on top. So yeah, I go for blue."
"Speaker 2","00;11;42;15","00;12;14;03","So just here the might. My question, where is the noise and fluctuation term and is that just like Brownian motion or. I don't know. So yeah, like what is the where is the Omega random fluctuation? Like, is it just, I don't know, random in, in terms of Brownian motion or is there some other random fluctuation positionally like do things wiggle."
"Speaker 1","00;12;21;22","00;13;08;06","Definitely somebody knows more about stochastic processes. And I know several people listen who do could help with this like in a math stream on a little bit of the stochastic aspect here. But I think at a first pass, there's situations where the what is modeled as noise versus what is modeled as signal have differential ratios. There's times where like the regression is very the F, even if it's a regression, another function is like very tight and then the noise is modeled as low versus one where just the location of X is just dominated by the noise term."
"Speaker 1","00;13;08;06","00;13;17;16","But I'm sure it's way more than that to Steven or Dean."
"Speaker 3","00;13;19;14","00;14;06;15","Well, I was just going to say, you know, often when we see I'm just thinking broadly in terms of the modeling approaches and active inference, often it brings in temperature as a way to sort of bring in the kind of noise fluctuations into models. Whereas here it's directly seen as a noise fluctuation term so I think that's maybe again, because we're going down to more first principles here and that it's getting down to stochastic dynamics, which isn't necessarily even thought of as temperature, but there's something more, more foundational OK."
"Speaker 1","00;14;07;10","00;14;07;24","Yeah. Blue."
"Speaker 2","00;14;08;28","00;14;34;22","So temperature is like, yeah, right. Like the increase in temperature like random motion would increase. So that does make sense to me. So another point out of this section or maybe if anybody else has a point here going down into the next set of equations, unless anybody else."
"Speaker 1","00;14;35;12","00;15;04;23","You're just to summarize that. It's kind of like the temperature parameter is understood sometimes to play this role of mediating the difference between the particles motion being driven by some sort of directed motion like change in position through time, not that stationary of position, which is like kind of the observable in that chain that directed motion versus thermal slash Brownian."
"Speaker 1","00;15;05;18","00;15;34;06","And then that might be kind of where these statistical assumptions come into play. So it's like variance estimation, but temperature is just one kind of variance with the motion of particles. But and it has a it has a physical interpretation. And I mean, it's not an insignificant piece. I don't know. We can explore more where temperature specifically comes into play."
"Speaker 1","00;15;34;06","00;15;42;28","But Steven, I think you're getting at the right thing that this is not temperature bound, but it does relate to that sort of situation. OK, blue."
"Speaker 2","00;15;44;09","00;15;53;13","So I don't know if you want to go down to equations 15 and 16 probably where my next question or comment is, do you have them in there or now."
"Speaker 1","00;15;53;13","00;15;54;26","All copied in or now."
"Speaker 2","00;15;55;09","00;15;55;19","Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;15;56;28","00;15;57;12","Go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;15;58;15","00;16;51;15","So it's equation 15. I think that's x tilde dot. Yes, P x tilde is a probability current which I thought that that was cool because I've never really heard of that term. A probability current like how probability changes over time or how the probability density changes over time. Like what is that a probability occurrence like that was just it's an interesting, I don't know, like term that I hadn't heard before and then in the second equation 16, it says that this is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density under disruptive and conservative forces."
"Speaker 2","00;16;51;27","00;17;17;19","So where the term on the left is the disruptive forces and the term on the right is the conservative forces. And I thought that was interesting, especially relating back to the zero video where you guys were talking about a tensor and Dean was talking about tension. And I think that there's is like an interesting tension here. Between like conserving and dissipating."
"Speaker 2","00;17;18;05","00;17;55;26","And it just makes me wonder how how like like is death when like the dissipate of like term is winning? Like is that like what causes like a system or I mean, I know that the the term winning or term being greater doesn't cause a system to die or when the system is decomposing, if that can be represented here in terms of these disruptive and conservative forces in the process of an organism dying or ceasing to exist OK."
"Speaker 2","00;17;56;03","00;17;58;08","All right. And way more questions and so nice."
"Speaker 1","00;17;58;19","00;18;34;18","Let's let's look at 1516 a little bit so yes probability current it's kind of in this dynamical systems framing it's being bridged with formalisms that are like more like a current like a flow on a dynamical landscape. There's that sort of angle. But then there and maybe there's also more of a fluid flow component blue if."
"Speaker 2","00;18;35;26","00;19;06;11","I was needed. So like it's funny when I look up a probability current like also foreshadowing foreshadowing the dot zero, it says in quantum mechanics, the probability current sometimes called probability flux is a mathematical quantity describing the flow of probability. So so it's interesting that it's related to quantum mechanics. And in terms of these like instead of these classical physics things that we've kind of been looking at or dealing with so far."
"Speaker 1","00;19;10;03","00;19;42;22","Yeah. So this 14 is OK, this might be only a partial elements or, or example hopefully one is useful. So this is X tilde with a dot. So that's x tilde, all the coordinates of motion and an X with a dot means derivative of so this left parameter with the tilt in a dot is how the generalized coordinates are changing through time."
"Speaker 1","00;19;43;09","00;20;16;04","So that's kind of what is being modeled the data that are being whether they're an observable or an unobserved estimated state in a Bayesian graph. So whether it's an O or an S, that plus its all of its derivatives, and then that is being partitioned into one big complex function f modeling it the flow. And then this noise omega tilde over both R over tilde."
"Speaker 1","00;20;16;21","00;20;27;18","So the these are both over like each of these higher derivatives also have an associated noise term and then it says, yeah, OK, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;20;29;06","00;21;08;20","In some ways that could be an analogy. I'm not saying it's the same, but there's a there seems to be a myriad of the enthalpy turn an entropic term. So you get in Gibbs free energy where one is where this is the is bound within the molecules at play and then the other term this end in tropic term where it's kind of dissipating so the that it's it's another because these things arch is translatable just like mass and energy are translatable and they're known to ultimately be conserved."
"Speaker 3","00;21;10;16","00;21;51;16","They can only be the overall mass energy of a system is always conserved, but it could be translated between normally we don't think about that because it only happens in nuclear reactions. But if you think in information it's still and this and I see they talk about this idea of probability mass so that there's almost an ability to think about that conservation of energy in a form which has mass, which has form, as opposed to when things are dissipated as light where it doesn't have mass anymore."
"Speaker 1","00;21;56;25","00;21;57;12","OK, blue."
"Speaker 2","00;22;00;04","00;22;33;15","So I think where they're talking about the conservation of probability mass, I think that they mean like the conservation of the total probability. They're like so the probability mass function, right? So I think it's that which relates to like the it's the conservation of mass, but it's also the conservation of information using that conservation of probability like the probability of all of the possible things happening has to add up to 100% like that."
"Speaker 2","00;22;33;15","00;22;38;29","Probability is never going to change. And so I think that that is there."
"Speaker 1","00;22;40;11","00;23;12;19","That it has to add up to one like fraction or 100% has the realest and and instrumentalists take the realest take is something has to happen and then the instrumentalists take is if we model it this way we're going to be able to use statistics. But if it was like, well, the chance of getting heads is 60% and the chance of getting tails is 60% in this next flip it would open up the space in a different way."
"Speaker 1","00;23;13;26","00;23;33;00","It, it's, it's kind of outside the bounds of the model. You can have a model or both happen, but still there's, it's a different thing, you know, can you model things that can't happen in the real world? Or if it's not a good measuring stick for statistics, which is kind of like that one, something must happen. We have to model something happening."
"Speaker 1","00;23;33;00","00;23;46;00","We have to model a data set rho being added. Otherwise what is happening if it were like 11 every one of every 1.2 rows. So again here. Yep."
"Speaker 3","00;23;46;02","00;24;17;24","Steven in relation to the point you just made, I'm just curious whether if these functions can be used in multiple particles in say, for instance, you have the, the idea of is the probability of a coin being flipped is 5050 for instance, or a rigged coin could be 6040 in one way. However, the probability if there's noise on how big something is."
"Speaker 3","00;24;17;24","00;24;47;22","So for instance, you've got, you've got a coin and it's flipping between being 60, 40, 50, 50, 40, 30. So there's kind of a there's a random fluctuation in that behavior which may be contextually contingent. That in itself wouldn't be in the one equation. But if you have multiple particles there, they could start to behave not just as one predictable thing that they themselves could have the change in probability approaches."
"Speaker 1","00;24;49;21","00;24;50;07","Thanks Blue."
"Speaker 2","00;24;51;16","00;25;22;20","So I think specifically as related to here and I think that this is derived like I'm not, I don't really know, I don't really do these like derivations. It's definitely not my area of expertize, but I think in terms of the conservation of mass, like, like we're not creating or destroying matter, the conservation of the probability mass, it just says that all the particles, if you're looking at it doesn't matter if it's one particle or a thousand particles, the particles are somewhere, right?"
"Speaker 2","00;25;22;20","00;25;40;28","Like so the particles are not nowhere like the particles are somewhere. So so it's that kind of like the idea that, you know, all the probability has two atoms. One like there is 100% chance that you will find the particle of interest somewhere. I mean, you're right."
"Speaker 1","00;25;47;06","00;26;22;06","OK, yeah. Blue good section to pull out important, some important bridge equations. So we have the signals of noise. Now when the signal that we're modeling with the instrumentalist take we're modeling how much the car weighs defined as the one that comes to walk over to me when I call for it or something like that that could be dominated by different functions or could be driven by different noise on different timescales."
"Speaker 1","00;26;23;00","00;27;08;06","So the signal sort of directed motion component or model of all component of the motion through time is the purple. And here is like some flow with Upsidedown triangle that we talked a little bit about, not zero, but would of course be good to hear from someone who knows more about this flow operator object signal is like the movement on a probability distribution on those states changing and then the noise is the dissipate of component Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;27;11;06","00;27;53;08","Appears as well that by breaking it into deceptive and conservative components, it's serving a similar role to separating into complexity and accuracy. It's moving a way to break apart the dissipation where the because you're not actually talking about a final target, but more like things just doing what they do in some ways and having a very kind of physics fundamental process."
"Speaker 3","00;27;53;25","00;28;06;06","I think that's proving to be useful because it's also, again, something which can be translated into different different types of math, different types of physics."
"Speaker 1","00;28;13;19","00;28;38;10","OK, so let's connect it to the morphogenesis. So what do they do in the paper? They're modeling the motion of cells. So why does it matter, this whole discussion that we're having about how to get from the notion of generalized coordinates, if you're the modelers, you get to define that and get to set the parameter between this. If you're the experimentalist, then you're inferring this kind of like a regression."
"Speaker 1","00;28;38;13","00;29;34;05","Like if this was a regression term and a noise term on the regression that and then there's some function that helps you fit a certain solution to the one linear regression that fits it best. So it's like kind of in that same genre here. So if we take the realistic on that, it's like how the actual system is defined as or inferred to be as from experimental data and then flowing the probability density on that of our inference on that, whether we're getting that from the data or whether we're defining that system formally so that modeling we could help from the authors or someone else like it engages some new future."
"Speaker 1","00;29;34;14","00;30;07;13","It's like a bridge to some other set of equations. So that's where it would be good to learn more like what is actually enabled here, but it enables a new vista that separates that, that enables this separation. So we can talk about instead of this like potentially extremely open ended and nonlinear change on the system can be bounded within a statistical inference zero to one inference framework."
"Speaker 1","00;30;08;10","00;30;23;07","That is more amenable to certain kinds of analysis. So that would help model cell location and all of that. But I think there's still a lot more to learn and unpack. OK, Dean. Yes."
"Speaker 4","00;30;25;16","00;30;49;12","So I want to just sort of step back for a second here because I want to go we started out talking about so what what are the implications for least action so the act part? And then we sort of stepped into the idea of what? Well, what came before the action? Well, it was the slowest. It's now kind of want to go back to the action part in this in that under that section two to two."
"Speaker 4","00;30;49;25","00;31;18;14","The second paragraph says that the least action principle can predict the emergence of form. So what Daniel was mentioning there, that sort of the morphogenesis in terms of the flow or paths of least action in biological systems, for example, in colonies ants find the paths of least action to harvest food and bring it to the colony. Example considers their paths as flow channels or trajectories, finding the least average action for each instance of foraging given available resources."
"Speaker 4","00;31;18;23","00;31;51;01","So this gets me thinking about, well, what do we mean by least action as opposed to, say, most action? And that, that that general way, the general way that things tend to follow. Like if you thought of an analogy of of maybe a 19th century war where armies would line up facing one another are parallel to one another."
"Speaker 4","00;31;51;17","00;32;31;27","This is speaking more like a flow state, more like you find in nature where the the molecules we talked about it here are sort of flowing and flowing down the side of the ball to the least potential energy. And so now my question is, OK, so why does nature tend to flow with the advantage of least action? Whereas people with instruments don't necessarily flow or follow one another unless they're mirroring some other form or some other shape."
"Speaker 4","00;32;32;13","00;33;05;02","So it's interesting to me because I think by nature we are quite adaptable. But when we start making non-living things as instruments to necessarily take the nature away, the life away, we're maybe not as quite as adaptable. So I'm trying to bring it up, trying to step back and now pull us back into this idea of so what advantage is there in this physics view of least action?"
"Speaker 4","00;33;05;02","00;33;26;26","There must be something advantageous there in nature. So what is it? I'm not the geneticist, so I don't know what this what the signal milieu is that makes that so. So I want to tap your guys and gals expertize on this because I don't have it right."
"Speaker 1","00;33;26;26","00;33;27;23","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;33;29;13","00;34;00;27","So following on what Dean's saying there, I think with them in the traditional sense, we tend to take what we call equilibrium dynamic approaches. So for instance, the arm, we the armies are lined up, like Dean said. Then there's a battle and then there's the final state. So we talk about the initial conditions, which is equilibrium as one lined up and the final state, and then the bit in the middle we sort of talking to our shirt or off shoulder or whatever and cough a few times."
"Speaker 3","00;34;00;27","00;34;25;02","And somehow it happens and in some ways with the biological approach, it's like it's in that because all that bit in the middle is where the flow is happening. So essentially speaking in biology, it doesn't have those in initial conditions in the sort of traditional sense of pure equilibrium. It's always in this non equilibrium, or at least a large component is in non equilibrium state."
"Speaker 3","00;34;25;02","00;34;54;22","So this is an interesting thing is it's flowing down towards the least energy. It never reaches so we might think that's it always. So for instance, in the chemical reactions you set, you take your pure reactants you mix them together. We still we do the reaction. And then once you got your products, which could be a precipitate for instance, you know, it could be a ton of the precipitate."
"Speaker 3","00;34;55;00","00;35;16;28","It then gets filtered, it gets washed, it gets dried and it gets measured for how pure it is. And now it's in this kind of stable product form, you know. So I think, yes, this, this, this question about what does it mean to flow is really important."
"Speaker 1","00;35;19;11","00;35;20;13","Thanks, Stephen. All right, Dean."
"Speaker 4","00;35;23;20","00;35;54;16","Well, what this what this flowing and following thing kind of says is that the that the desire line or that or the termite mound, the result is of signaling which which is I don't know if that's collective signaling. I don't know if it's the stick murky part of it. Like, I don't know why nature sees the advantage in the following, but there has to be something there."
"Speaker 4","00;35;54;16","00;36;02;11","Why? Why why is that? Advantageous? Why is that more adaptable versus the alternative."
"Speaker 1","00;36;04;21","00;36;05;19","OK, thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;36;06;27","00;36;38;20","Well, I suppose one way of looking at that is it's the only close. I mean, if we're going to take a realist route, recognizing that it maybe it's the only plausible route on the table we they don't get to, you know, forge teeth in a kiln or you know, in a way that's partly why all chemicals that are available in nature have to be within certain plausible temperature."
"Speaker 3","00;36;38;20","00;37;10;20","Scales and pressure scales that can yield those those products at. So I mean, that kind of doesn't answer the question exactly because I know that's kind of a bit of a but it's part of it's what's available, I think in terms of biological plausibility. And I suppose in some ways humans, we, we, we adapt to the cognition to try and move outside that OK."
"Speaker 1","00;37;10;26","00;37;11;13","Yeah. Dean."
"Speaker 4","00;37;13;12","00;37;45;18","One last thing on this. And that is that following implies that there's also something leading. There always has to be something taking that that initiative for others to fall in line behind. So shifting that and making leadership something that's more lateral. So sort of going forward together as opposed to who do who do we decide to to follow behind?"
"Speaker 4","00;37;45;19","00;38;21;01","That's an interesting thing in terms of sort of assessing out how this least action principles things turns into things that we actually see phenomenal phenomena logically. So again, we're going to get into the the what what the final form takes. I just think, though, when we were sort of treating this in the 0.0, this was kind of a pivotal moment because it went from what are all the things that have to be in place for formation to occur to now let's let's look at what the what the form now results."
"Speaker 4","00;38;21;01","00;38;50;08","As as I said in here, in that one paragraph, it said well, the previous paragraph says physics offers a useful formalism to understand at a quantitative level the ability of biological systems to work towards. So now we're we're basically now moving to something that is that is adaptable. So I think like I said, I don't want to hover or talk is one point."
"Speaker 4","00;38;50;08","00;39;02;21","But I think it's an interesting part in terms, especially when we get into the the discussion at the end around why what some of the assumptions were and yada yada OK."
"Speaker 1","00;39;04;05","00;39;04;26","Thanks. Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;39;04;27","00;40;15;00","See that this work towards idea, I mean that can be thought of as a modeling and a life realist problem. Like how how does that work towards and in some ways accuracy and complexity can be used once we if we're at the level of assuming that we are actively inferring to stay alive. But prior to that something like conservation and dissipation or conserved a bit more foundational OK because if I conserving working within this conserving and dissipating noise dynamic at levels which are below what we are consciously aware of however which all our cognition is effectively built upon somewhere, we we're able to potentially give that towards this with without necessarily having set a goal."
"Speaker 3","00;40;15;22","00;40;28;26","I mean, it could be and I think that's that might be even an interest in see how that rubs out in the real, real world of active inference labs and papers and stuff."
"Speaker 3","00;40;30;27","00;40;33;05","Yeah, cool."
"Speaker 1","00;40;34;00","00;40;59;01","Yeah. A lot you link there Stephen just now like accuracy complexity and then OK, we'll leave it for a future day and work and who knows how many of these are just concordance versus tautological. But accuracy within a model is like pragmatic, pragmatic aims within a model where the imperative to prefer to fit as much data as possible."
"Speaker 1","00;40;59;14","00;41;36;10","And then it's like conservative using the reward structure that worked at one time. Step using that generative model moving forward versus changing it, any sort of dispersion around the parameters, as evidenced at the lowest level of the chain, the position of the particles or the actual parameter that's being models like the actual image that's being persisted on versus these higher generative models which don't realize like at the kind of, you know, tip of a javelin, so to speak."
"Speaker 1","00;41;36;27","00;42;09;13","So then the signal and noise is also like conservation and dissipation with respect to the model. And then that is coming all the way back to morphology with like the position in stasis versus vibration of the particle from thermal. So it's like a lot that gets linked here. But whereas is least action in all of this, I yeah, blue."
"Speaker 2","00;42;13;23","00;42;47;21","So just to read a quote from the paper, it says Since Self-organizing Open systems are not conservative, they're structured flow is quintessentially dissipated. Dissipated. And so and that's like, you know, down it's in the third paragraph and the least action principle section. So just that that goes back to what I was saying earlier, like does that equate to death?"
"Speaker 2","00;42;47;21","00;43;04;00","Like when a system totally dissipates like it's ultimately dissipated. So, you know, we stay in this like nest for a little while and then we dissipate, right? Like is that it can can it be modeled like these processes using these equations? I find that's super interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;43;06;03","00;43;08;22","Yeah. Thanks, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;43;11;21","00;43;37;10","This, this, this idea of the least action, I think tiny move, what Blue is saying there as well is, is lease action. Maybe we should say dynamical least action as opposed to lease action, which we normally think of. I well, I was saying reactants products. What was what's the what's, you know, what's the route to get from A to B or the army lined up to final space."
"Speaker 3","00;43;38;15","00;44;09;28","Normally we are taking stance and conditions, ending conditions or know where I am now, what's my goal, what's the least to get there? But those two things are defined in some ways that are definable. So I think it's a good now all the bit in between is trying to go to the least action and in some way using that kind of in the space of chaos."
"Speaker 3","00;44;09;28","00;45;04;15","Just by this, if we're going to take the kind of complexity approach in humans systems is in a chaotic state where you're trying to at some time make sense of how to act. But however, you know, in some ways there's only chaos moving into complexity which is available. So biological systems, theoretically, maybe not the idea of complicated and kind of simple sort of reproductive sort of that the by equilibrium state systems like mechanical systems aren't necessarily available, although you could argue that maybe certain properties of our morphology, like our bone structure in that gives something which is approximate to that."
"Speaker 3","00;45;05;27","00;45;24;12","Once we know how to move our arm, we have a relatively simple thing that we can now bring into our regime of attention. But yeah, I wonder what people think of dynamical least action is, is somehow what's going on here yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;45;24;16","00;45;58;28","Thanks, Stephen. Just here's one thing on that's a good idea. A question I hope this is accurate too, because I think we're all learning here. But this is definitely really challenging area in some ways to approach, especially given our realistically limited familiarity. So again, it'd be awesome for people who have more familiarity with these equations to join us, like either in preparation or even just joining us on these streams so that we can actually learn and connect to these other areas."
"Speaker 1","00;45;58;28","00;46;23;15","Somebody who sees this formalism like every day, just like we might see some other one. OK, but Stephen brought up is this is dynamical least action. OK, so first kind of a hopefully non contentious point that we're analyzing what we model. We can only ask the computer to calculate the numbers that we ask it to model and that we can't expect something that goes truly beyond that."
"Speaker 1","00;46;23;24","00;47;15;27","Not say that the models can't have surprising outputs or interactions et cetera, but we can't have it go beyond what we specify. And the model is over X tilde, which is the generalized coordinates of motion, which is the position and all of the higher derivatives, the whole integrator chain position and all higher order moments of the statistical distribution, they're called moments like the first, second, third moment of the derivatives of the statistical distribution and these are basically terms of approximation of motion that allow a high order like a Taylor series approximation or oval terraces approximation to allow snapshot modeling with real time flow action, cognition, perception."
"Speaker 1","00;47;15;27","00;47;50;11","It's the flow over as gets explored. The blanket states this is like the flow over essay and I states actions and internal states. So like this is enabling thing a flow description of markup like it states and their perception cognition action their flow overstates their change through time including higher order moments of time so that it is a dynamical systems model."
"Speaker 1","00;47;50;27","00;48;21;29","But still there has to be a snapshot like a time series model of a stock price. It has a value at whatever time resolution or continuous or discrete it's being time series model that. So it's kind of the relationship between snapshot modeling and capturing higher order trends. And this is a certain way to think about that in the direction that they're going to take it towards the more called blanket partitioning and bridging it to everything that that affords."
"Speaker 1","00;48;21;29","00;48;24;08","OK, Dean and then Stewart."
"Speaker 4","00;48;26;05","00;49;04;10","So this is really important because I think it I want to tease something that maybe we can look at right, right here, but only in the point to so between the US doing the live stream zero and today there was a report about the rate at which climate, I think was a U.N. report, the rate at which climate change is happening so rapidly that as as the people who are sort of in that highly changing flow state aren't able to necessarily going to be able to adapt to the rate of change."
"Speaker 4","00;49;04;22","00;49;38;00","And so I wonder if some of what this paper speaks to might help us understand why the authors of that report are indicating to us that the environment in which we we are existing in is going to change so quickly that as cells within that larger structure, our form is not going to be able to adapt quickly enough to the the way that the external system is is changing."
"Speaker 4","00;49;38;10","00;49;50;25","So I want to see that for the point, too. But I think this least action principle part would be a good entry point into some of these bigger questions going forward. So I just want to park that, but I think it matters."
"Speaker 1","00;49;52;09","00;50;18;04","Yeah. Just to give one note on that, the rate of change and how it changes, those are kind of natural language descriptions of derivatives, of how things are changing right. Might be a simple claim to some, but that's really important to keep in mind. So how things are changing. And then that's always going to be unknown to some degree."
"Speaker 1","00;50;19;03","00;50;33;18","So how things change and so on. This is the generalized coordinates of motion and so it is about modeling rates of change and predictability of systems that have rates of change and OK, yes."
"Speaker 3","00;50;34;03","00;51;09;12","Stephen with this, we mentioned there about your action, perception, cognition, and in some ways the cognition is and on the generative model and the generative model is an action policy model. OK, so we've got this recognition coming in is drive by this action. And of course one challenge you've got in the climate change scenario is really what you think is one thing."
"Speaker 3","00;51;09;12","00;51;40;18","But being able to act and being I mean, the danger is we hit a point where no matter how much we know it's beyond the ability to act in our capabilities and capacities as a, as a, as a as a species. The so this, this while I think the work cognition is useful, maybe be useful to be careful just that the inference process is more general because it can be can be a process which is, let's say, happening beyond thought."
"Speaker 3","00;51;41;21","00;52;14;15","So so is is another action almost giving a higher order understanding on the generative motion for generative model for an action in active inference who a lot of what's going on underneath this is beyond our perception literally and way beyond so that that that can be interesting or useful to strip out nice."
"Speaker 1","00;52;15;01","00;52;16;05","Yeah blue thanks."
"Speaker 2","00;52;18;20","00;52;53;15","So just to kind of go back to dynamical least action I do think that that's what they're referring to at the very end of the section the authors say from our perspective, the key observation here is that any disruptive random dynamical system can be formulated as gradient flow on the log likelihood of its status. This is reflected in our solution to the fucker Planck equation in 17, which means the action is the time or pass integral of the marginal likelihood or for information for any system or model area."
"Speaker 2","00;52;54;01","00;53;18;10","So this is the really the key thing. This means the least actually the integral over the Lagrangian turns into an integration over the self information of states, which is known as entropy in information theory. In short, the principle of least action manifests as a principle of least entropy for systems that possess a random dynamical attractor and thereby obtain non equilibrium steady state."
"Speaker 1","00;53;21;15","00;53;26;11","Thanks a lot, Blue. Great point. Tour de France."
"Speaker 5","00;53;27;01","00;53;46;19","Hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late and I only have a half an hour to. I'm in the middle of fighting preschool, so daycare is a whole mess right now. I do apologize. I want to take this time. It's a little messy next to of you, but I think we found a school, so hopefully next week loving what is."
"Speaker 3","00;53;49;01","00;53;49;12","More."
"Speaker 1","00;53;50;09","00;54;14;09","Unexpected but preferred, you know, how will we model that? But thanks a lot for joining. This is really cool. So we were just describing some of the formalisms. But is it where would you like to begin? It'd be awesome to hear like any just introduction and context on the paper. And then we kind of jumped in at least action."
"Speaker 1","00;54;14;18","00;54;17;03","And we'd love to hear your take on that."
"Speaker 5","00;54;18;02","00;54;42;01","Sure. All right, Soledad. Induction. So I guess I'll start with myself. So I work in McClelland Slap and Tufts and doing a Ph.D. in biology and is the whole kind of active influence. Part of my work is him actually before my entire PhD. So I try myself. So I wanted to really learn what kind of information and physics to in a biology context."
"Speaker 5","00;54;42;02","00;55;04;09","I didn't I didn't want to study the whole level of, you know, I mean, I'm sort of getting that as a technique, but I didn't want to have to focus on protein interaction and, you know, genetic information where you measure all these things. So based on something a bit more broader than that. And so when I reached out to Mike and once I got some, I accepted he I was like, you know, I have so much to kill, can you send me somewhere, do something cool?"
"Speaker 5","00;55;04;22","00;55;20;06","And then he sent me to call first and that's when that's the first time I heard the term Active in Science. So I spent about four months and called stuff and then basically started working on, on, on this. I think half the work in the paper was actually done in those, those couple of months when I was in college stuff."
"Speaker 5","00;55;21;09","00;55;45;09","So the overall goal of the paper and not that part of my work is to see if we look at morphogenesis and similar biological processes, can we look at something where you have a very kind of kind of baseline sense of like behavior where you have cells that can't do like a morphogenesis? Basically, I'm much familiar with the whole biology aspect of this paper, but essentially it's the idea is to model cells that are uninformed."
"Speaker 5","00;55;45;09","00;56;04;02","They have some kind of, you know, trying to code something that encodes there the structure. The, the basically you have that kind of process already ingrained in that kind of model into the, into the cells. But they're completely were just stem cell. Like they don't have actually yet achieved their final form. And they're just like in the simulation in biology, right?"
"Speaker 5","00;56;04;02","00;56;30;02","They're starting off a very few asymmetries. I think there's a famous who said that. But some physicians at one said most of physics is basically just a symmetries. That's similar to everywhere. And that's exactly kind of how most biology things biologists think of of morphogenesis. There's some asymmetry and the beginning and the egg with some there's some some disinformation, some gradient off some things, some localization of certain agents."
"Speaker 5","00;56;30;10","00;56;56;15","And then from that on, basically everything else just follows through but it's it's it's hard to believe that's the whole side of the story because there's just so much complexity and so many cells doing the same time. So if there isn't any capability for them to adapt to a signal to the environment and to learn from each other, it's hard to believe that in the time frame they given, they can really, you know, achieve the complex motion as outcomes that we know to exist."
"Speaker 5","00;56;56;25","00;57;22;12","So coming to this paper, basically this model is actually already like the father or mother of this paper was already it's done before I even heard this topic that that was the new once place of model structure itself was already done by I think called it most if not all of it like this. Basically on the paper and Giovanni as well, the basic gave them some input on on on what what a backbone of biology would look like."
"Speaker 5","00;57;22;28","00;57;49;15","And so they already figured out basically that's to a simplistic model itself. So as far as I know from call an aside myself and my simulations many practical concerns to women to complex. If you have too many cells at once then you go on to problems in the beginning something I actually add onto the model even the baseline model was that damping parameter which I talk later on that the results which I often like keep hot."
"Speaker 5","00;57;49;15","00;58;09;17","But I find it very interesting because it's one of the requirement is for active instance for for scanning generalization where it's not the adjustment stations, there's a smooth landscape. And when you have all these cells initially clustered together, and the trying to infer that place and they all kind of have some random random need in this space, prior beliefs, they don't know where to go from there."
"Speaker 5","00;58;09;17","00;58;47;07","And if you right. If you have already high precision and they're in the sensory apparatus initially they have a really hard time still end up mostly fine and getting later. But they jump all over the place and you could imagine that be very bad for an an abortion scenario if every cell immediately jumps to the first two they have we actually think now in the Mark Latham upset last cancer initiation happens a little bit like that with the precisions I said to high there's paper coming out soon by a colleague of mine that talks a bit more about that argument but so basically from we had the target morphology already and of course encode that"
"Speaker 5","00;58;47;07","00;59;26;13","and you saw what you see in the and the baseline control experiments was already done. Well, I was interested in as basically again, coming back to my my question and my approach to this from the biology side of you is how can we use the information flow specifically for infants to manipulate and babies better control morphogenesis outcomes and control biology so the two main results in that in that paper are looking at, if you set up, you know, a stuff like a normal biology experiment where you basically into one part of the machinery and then see everything reacts, you actually control the process information processing itself."
"Speaker 5","00;59;27;01","00;59;52;16","So one was basically if you put in a an asymmetry and the response of the cells to the to the signaling that against they get the signal and concentrations in the environment, how can you basically completely model the entire morphogenesis outcome even though you actually left the entire coding herself? That's always one thing I tried to stress in that paper the talk of morphology and all this information is exactly the same."
"Speaker 5","00;59;52;21","01;00;13;05","None of them, the basically so there's are coding of where this be, but how the course information has then changed. So the first figure is that we have two, two heads and two tails and to tell them not OIF it just did it myself and then publish it. I think it's in there as well. That that's basically something that we'll also see in the lab."
"Speaker 5","01;00;13;05","01;00;33;04","I think that was mentioned as well, that that's something that that Mike Leavitt now has done a scenario where they basically induce us to head types right. That's something that's really weird to biologists. And again, in the type of manipulations that we do in a lot to have the numbers that they didn't manipulate it. And I can today coat again the DNA from those scenarios that specifically was exactly the same."
"Speaker 5","01;00;33;18","01;01;12;27","But some of their perturb, the actual electric network itself, based on the state space essentially. So that kind of like what where this inspiration came from. And then the second part where we the malformation or I also talk about cancer information. Now, of course, it's it's called they call cancer because we didn't put proliferation and this in this simulation so that's its initiation stage but it's the idea is that again on the something that we talk about also in the lab and we've called many emails afterwards and it kind of also goes back to this whole idea of how different psychiatric disorders work in the brain where you have some of these inference processes being"
"Speaker 5","01;01;12;27","01;01;44;27","disrupted and then these large scale outcomes, but they kind of start somewhere. So idea was here is that if we disrupt only the information flow from one cell to the other cells in your cells to that one cell, then what will that what would that cell do? So basically just completely reduce its sensitivity to the environment. And then so happened and what happened was that this one cell basically kind of like it didn't it didn't move a whole lot in front the wrong kind of cell type and it was completely out of place."
"Speaker 5","01;01;44;27","01;02;03;16","Right. So that's always but in biology, if a cell is doing something that's not supposed to in a place was not supposed to be. And what I thought was interesting afterwards was, OK, so how can we rescue that? And again, like, why not trying to rescue it in a traditional cancer therapy idea where you bombard the cell or just kill?"
"Speaker 5","01;02;04;05","01;02;23;13","How can you actually have this system itself? So the idea was to increase the so the sensitivity was still disrupted from that one cell. But then the flow, like how much concentrate, how much the other cells reacted to it. So basically we manipulated how the information flow from the other cells to that cells was flowing and increased that."
"Speaker 5","01;02;24;04","01;02;43;17","So and then what was interesting is that the kind of they were just kind of like going more closely into interaction. We just seen the time timelapse figure and then eventually they reshape. So even though the cells like normally who others, it's a deterministic simulation, right? It's like it's driven. It's always the same random seat. So you run the simulation, you run again, there will be some outcome."
"Speaker 5","01;02;44;00","01;03;01;18","So you can kind of know which cells go where even though, you know, no cell starts. Authors like knowing I'm supposed to be not cell. That's not how it happens because we run the simulation of a fixed randomized seed. We always know which cell ends up going where, and then that's cancer simulation. That was not the same anymore."
"Speaker 5","01;03;01;18","01;03;25;14","So actually, even though at the end after that rescue experiment, they ended up with a perfectly normal shape and followed in the mythology at the end, it wasn't what normally was supposed to happen, but the cells that normally were gone to their fixed positions didn't all do that. So there was some reconfiguration, which is something that that's an ideal strategy that you would like, like something that exploit the systems interaction itself to then rescue an overall target."
"Speaker 5","01;03;25;24","01;03;56;02","You want to work on the the type, but you want to work on what's actually wrong. You don't care exactly what cell does and implemented. That's a lot of cool science, a little tangential, but that's really cool work. But you've model that works on neuronal networks, lot analysis where they see that this works not because it's a simpler enough system to work with you only, but what they're seeing is that there's actually a multitude of implement limitations that the new neurons can can use and do use individual reasons entirely different parameters."
"Speaker 5","01;03;56;15","01;04;17;00","This like two to four full different system ancient concentrations to achieve the same end result. And it's actually the response was once a stress to submissions environment is that in the details. But in the end the actual homeostatic aspect of it is kept the same, right? The goal is having something and up the same. Steven with that to speak."
"Speaker 5","01;04;17;18","01;04;18;00","Go ahead."
"Speaker 3","01;04;19;17","01;04;44;25","Oh, thanks. Yeah, I was just going to one question. Is the idea of flow in a way more flow is better even though that. So unlike say a generative model where you maybe don't want too much complexity, you can have a lot of flow as long as that flow is not noise it just is able to form. So that's the first part."
"Speaker 3","01;04;44;25","01;05;06;27","And the second part is are you saying is with this flow, it's about finding where the choice point is or where the threshold is to say, OK, that's now going to decide that that's going to create a morphological target, OK, as opposed to it just being a gradual gradient descent on energy."
"Speaker 5","01;05;07;17","01;05;41;25","It is more the gradual aspects of the earth. I would say it's it's not ideal to think about decision points, even though in the end it doesn't happen. It's something that we just get used to and our level of of speech, but on level of of, of our signaling cells is very much a gradual process. Right at the spatially you have all these are from prior beliefs to probabilities of being one cell in the other and the simulation and the idea of increased information flow or increased sensitivity would affect your modeling and manipulating of precision as well is that you are trying to get the vibrations."
"Speaker 5","01;05;41;25","01;06;01;27","A.M. I also specifically converge on a system where those probably actually end up somewhere meaningful, right? But if you don't want to be in a state with a constant fluctuating, constant randomized saw, you mentioned noise. That's one that you want to avoid. You also want to avoid that they basically do this and that that that's where you. Right the decision point right there."
"Speaker 5","01;06;01;27","01;06;25;16","This tells us basically going to what's one state and then the wrong one and then you increase the information flow of the other cells from the council rescue simulation to being away from that, but not you first of all not actually working on like, you know, identifying that point and then you're fixing that. You'd basically just realizing that the destination overall basically you basically look at the pipe, the voltage changes over time."
"Speaker 5","01;06;25;16","01;06;50;08","So how are they updating and how fast adapting? And then of course, in the end, what are they acting towards? And that gives you a cue. It's if you think from a mental point of view or even like experimentally simulation, that point of view, then that tells you, OK, so if that happened too fast, if there was malformation having too fast and you probably want to act on you want to increase sensitivity or something early on, you don't do it at one time."
"Speaker 5","01;06;50;08","01;06;59;23","You just set the parameters for the whole simulations. But it tells you basically the strength that the sensitivity is with respect to how early and how strongly that information is happening. So that's a question somewhat."
"Speaker 3","01;07;00;20","01;07;21;16","Yeah, I think that does one. I suppose one question just on that is, is it is there like an optimum level in terms of this flow I it peaks or is it like the more flow you can get, the better. And it's just literally a limit on how much information flow is possible."
"Speaker 5","01;07;24;10","01;07;47;09","I think on the second answer is that the boring answer always will depend on the context. I would say there is no I don't think you can say, you know, moment like that. What's happening, like more information flow is always better doesn't make sense. I think you always gave the answer to that. Why that is, right? Because in the end end up too much noise spacing assistance."
"Speaker 5","01;07;47;09","01;08;22;08","That answer has the respect of how much information actually is being Cammie process, what is the timescale of the sensor provider. So my my experimental work works a lot on basically having different variation of input signals. My model system, which is actually algae, I will get to that. But long story short, I actually once got the question that when I was had these randomized signals and I was feeding it and then someone asked like, well, you actually this is actually taking in more information because you have and I was like, well, like white noise technically carries more weight, more variation, but it's not informative, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;08;22;09","01;08;51;24","That's more information flow by itself is not better. More informative information flow informative part being is actually does it how quick does it change over time? So that's a lot of the what not to adjust. And with respect to the also the sensory precision and you know, the timings there are certain timescales involved in like how sentences how fast sensor states need to updates of internal states all these things together make up basically how fast an agent can react and how much information it can process."
"Speaker 5","01;08;51;24","01;08;55;10","And that's the the optimal level would be dependent on that essentially."
"Speaker 1","01;08;57;17","01;09;00;24","OK, awesome. Dean or Blue before we have anyone go again."
"Speaker 2","01;09;04;18","01;09;33;01","So I have the question. Can you fix the figure for general, please? Yep. Just so you had mentioned earlier, hi, by the way, it's nice to see you. I'm really glad. I'm glad you could make it. I guess it's a pleasant surprise. But here in figure four, you mentioned that you didn't model with proliferation in this model, but it seems to me that there's like more like it looks proliferative here."
"Speaker 2","01;09;33;09","01;09;48;27","So is that just like a very dense cluster at the first time? Step or do duplicated every time step or like how how did you end up with so many more like speeds or whatever, you know, agents, cells at the end. Then at the beginning."
"Speaker 5","01;09;49;16","01;10;11;14","There might be an optical sort of or communication part on my part. So the either the actual cells are eight and each of those images, all of them. But what you're seeing is the trace it, right? It's only the ones that have like the strongly colored dots and then like the little star around it at the end. But if you look at the last frames on that those are actually the cells."
"Speaker 5","01;10;11;23","01;10;38;21","What you see in the back is basically like time lapse, kind of like the snapshot of shots. They're not actually cells in there. It will be actually interesting I know thought of that. That will actually be a fairly simple introduction to each of those point steps to make that new cell optical is actually, I think basically call. And when I first when we initially published that, I think he had we at the end of the simulations, he basically then just add some new cells."
"Speaker 5","01;10;39;06","01;10;59;21","But he never went further with that. And I think it's the same problem that I mentioned that when you have initially and in the first time frame, it equals one that if you have some make cells close together you have to kind of set the precision lower because otherwise the two close together. I mean, it works somewhat, but it's very susceptible to such a patient and at that stage."
"Speaker 5","01;11;00;12","01;11;28;19","So in order if you basically want to introduce perforation, either like you said, or like like you guys gave me the idea to do it in between what you do at the end you would have to have all that which of course what cells do, right? If you have new cells formation that are not going to be the same kind of sense of rest that an mature or a form cell is, but that was space, I think just for the simulation, what was making a little complicated, but I'm just I'm not right now actually working on that simulation in what if if I did that would be great."
"Speaker 5","01;11;28;19","01;11;29;23","Yeah, maybe I'll come back to that."
"Speaker 2","01;11;30;06","01;11;42;00","No, that would be way cool. And if it needs to be like less sensitive at the beginning, like you just double the earth. Yeah. You just double the sensitivity at each time step. And then that way, like, you know, you would get that enhanced sensitivity over time."
"Speaker 5","01;11;42;16","01;12;04;22","And it's also very interesting from the point of view of fractal some there are some really cool. Every now I'll stand by. I recently read that Wolfram, the guy behind Wolfram Alpha, he's saying this whole new physics approach where they basically just have a simple set of rules and then they just use fractal multiplications and then each each time that, that goes on and they commit all these kind of static laws, which I haven't yet gotten deep into, I can't really say anything about how good and useful it is."
"Speaker 5","01;12;04;22","01;12;27;10","But the fact that we all know it's a very kind of formative mechanism that's used in biology extensively, and that's something you could use here as well, where basically each step will you introduce a new cell you kind of just have the same rule set initial and you run like a small simulation in that simulation essentially. And with the same simple set of rules, you could probably make up the whole much more complex."
"Speaker 5","01;12;27;10","01;12;37;05","So it probably looked nothing like this. I wouldn't expect this then afterwards to have like the same shape, but cool stuff, quality, just stuff that was right. Now but one day."
"Speaker 1","01;12;38;01","01;12;59;15","We'll just kind of unpack that because it's a great suggestion and thanks for kind of giving your take on it to France. It's really cool to hear like when the cells divide, you may need a first semester break or to introduce a symmetry break. You get some gradient. It can be gravity, it could be a nutrient gradient, it can be the entry point of the sperm that triggers a calcium wave."
"Speaker 1","01;12;59;23","01;13;27;03","But it's like asymmetries can give rise to asymmetries and then interacting. You get to morphogenesis and then now it's high, high and low, low. And then the alternations influence gene regulation. And that's like very complex. But adjacency effects are really important. And that's how we get the self-organization like of the insect eye or of tissues because they don't have to do what this challenges, which is sort of like get information spaced out."
"Speaker 1","01;13;28;01","01;13;51;18","This is like the bird flock morphology, which is also so cool because it does apply to other systems too, which I'm sure will be explored more. But like bodies fill out into morphology, not just dissolve. This is. Yeah, cool though. I mean, of course we really learned a lot. Let's return to least action just and feel free just to leave any time you'd like."
"Speaker 1","01;13;51;18","01;13;57;03","But on this action where does it come into play or what is it doing here?"
"Speaker 5","01;13;57;22","01;14;24;01","Yes. So it's that was more of a background section. So illegal gift was also on that on that paper was awesome. My son, petty supervisor, we talked to him. This is not nothing that I did and that was like novel I did like is not what we refer to. But I had to invent new math for that. But the idea was that is that what was George was doing like this action principles."
"Speaker 5","01;14;24;02","01;15;05;01","You know, the classical principles apply to basic questions. And he was like, well, you know, it's really I think you're missing like a communication aspect of this, you know, iconic. I mean, clearly how this fits into action principles and you not make clearly of of what like were diverged essentially and caused by people on to what he's Fingleton that by want to make it more explicit essentially that that the the principle is at least action principles by definition essentially but what it's trying to show you is is simply kind of like the whole idea of paper form from back when was that you could aim on could start from this has more of a physics"
"Speaker 5","01;15;05;01","01;15;25;09","background and then can work themselves to who benefits to biology and it's that's something that physicists are very familiar with right and the idea is actually where does this what is interesting take on it from the from the from the visual energy and that's what I think and so you start as a general definition what is an extreme."
"Speaker 5","01;15;25;24","01;15;45;06","And then you kind of see later on that the whole definition off the of the club have a divergence of innovation. Thank you very much corresponds to that. And it's also interesting to see basically where where that takes from sort of it as as a question and that's basically the the point of that was more not not at least action."
"Speaker 5","01;15;45;11","01;16;16;14","I used that particular creation. I use the classical the typical equations that Karl used for his vision for energy. There's more of motivation. And I hope the goal is to show essentially where this all flows from, like how do you get from, from, you know, from from, from, from the point of function, the beginning possibility, how all the problems function, how do you get from that to a visual plans to really make that kind of integration to physics title, which I know it filled out because there were the comments to that paper that were published with it."
"Speaker 5","01;16;16;14","01;16;30;13","And if you read that one or two of them were like bizarre to see how this integration that's doing. And my comment to that was then I think I called that that mini paper response paper like a tip integration to physics. So I know it didn't succeed in not apologize, but that was the goal."
"Speaker 1","01;16;33;09","01;16;39;01","OK, awesome. Dean would you like to go anywhere, ask anything?"
"Speaker 4","01;16;40;03","01;17;10;21","I don't even know. I'm just going to sit back and then kiss well, well for me. Yeah, you've taken a whole bunch of stuff around what a form might turn into based on what signals it's capable of acting on. Is that is that odd? I gross. So besides being a gross oversimplification, can we start there? Does that makes sense?"
"Speaker 5","01;17;11;05","01;17;34;25","Yeah. So like. Yes, yes, that makes sense. Basically, what I always like talking about is that what you put in and what you get out of what we put into model is encoding of of signaling. Responses are just like a classical. Like, if you see signaling a B but not much of C, and then you think you cell type eight, whatever that means, head to head type, and then you adjust your own signaling expressions."
"Speaker 5","01;17;34;25","01;18;02;18","Each cell basically has four signaling molecules that they can exchange, they can express, that they can sense, and based on different combinations of those, they think that one or the other and that is semi place encoded so they have basically form that map. That's what the of mythology is is meaning. So what we put in basically is is that including the kind of model process how the data, the take on diffusion constants, all that stuff that basically holds information and spreads to each other."
"Speaker 5","01;18;03;08","01;18;26;02","And then what we get out essentially is, is what kind of shapes like you said can can emerge from that. Of course initially what the initial model was basically you said how many shapes because you're interested can't do the shape that you put into it. So the point of this paper was is keeping that same target, the same kind of like I mean, each cell has these options that it can be based on word sensing."
"Speaker 5","01;18;26;02","01;18;47;25","And then on secreting. But keeping with that, can you get different shapes just by messing up the way that information flows in not out of the cell and it's being processed around the things that's again, that's that the inspiration from that comes from the I'm working on what we do a lot this way. We don't don't actually mess up that sort of genetic coding at the center of model enactments champs."
"Speaker 5","01;18;47;25","01;18;55;02","But you mess up how how basically the state space looks like how information at each point and times update it and that's that's the idea of this."
"Speaker 2","01;18;55;19","01;18;55;24","You."
"Speaker 1","01;18;59;16","01;19;21;13","What does it look like to engineer or design a different target morphology. How did you fit the Bayesian model or fit the flow descriptor whatever it was and it's representation towards the represent towards the anatomy that's described in figure three."
"Speaker 5","01;19;22;08","01;19;41;22","Yes. So the the the the outcomes that we get like the expense outcomes here we didn't like designed the template. Like I said, we keep those the same. We just basically had some intuition that some of them tried to be true. Of how we could change it based on just asymmetry and information flow. How would you design this one?"
"Speaker 5","01;19;42;26","01;19;59;28","Mainly so this is an abstract level. And again, this model itself is not that, as I recall just before I joined, it's that's not I didn't do as new, but how do you approach this? So basically idea is this the idea of is fairly biological. The idea is that you have state encoding for certain transcription factors basically. Right."
"Speaker 5","01;19;59;28","01;20;27;18","Will, based on whatever you sense, would then basically activate gene expression in the cells that and then allowed to differentiate. So cells most of morphogenesis essentially starts off from from something I mentioned initially you have some asymmetry and signaling that this is thought that basically even when you already have the the the unfurls egg and in an animal system there's some asymmetry that's being stored actively by by by the whole organism month essentially."
"Speaker 5","01;20;27;29","01;20;47;13","And the base from that is symmetry. Then you have gradient of ovary of difference and then so basically some cells will will sense more signaling type and less B And then from that they will make they will be expressed, it will then change a cell fate to a subject sulfate and that and then then you have more sulfates in the same thing atmosphere."
"Speaker 5","01;20;47;17","01;21;21;02","You have now more symmetry, but it's like often the same one. So you again will have some cells that will sense more and less of some signaling a sequence signaling ligands that will basically that turn out to be incorporated. Transcription factors, differential state expression to differentiation. So what this is the sense of what this is doing, what you're encoding, what the codes are, essentially those different relationships between transcription factor between signaling receptors, transcription factors downstream to a GI code where then basically we don't do proliferation again."
"Speaker 5","01;21;21;02","01;21;42;19","But this the first step to this basically one snippet of type morphology, one aspect where you have at that point in this hypothetical most intense experiments, you have four different signaling signaling safe for different signaling ligands that are being that being expressed that can be suppressed by the cells. And based on where you are in the cluster, you will see more or less of it."
"Speaker 5","01;21;42;19","01;22;03;17","And based on that information, you will then yourself the cell start to express more or less of was basically such defense relating so that was expressing more or less of that. And at some point of that you reach certain threshold where they actually will have undergone the differentiation process and have a new sulfate. And that's what these different head to tail and stuff."
"Speaker 5","01;22;03;24","01;22;35;15","So of course, like, you know, there's no animals this nine off that has a, you know, eight cells and four cell types, it makes a whole body that will be pretty crazy. Although there are some interesting doesn't small corners and systems where there are the these the silicones these from that one example where they have a complete map from from from cell to cell from basically 18 so they know exactly which cell base it turns out to be what cell the end they can go from the embryo and they can tell exactly this cell is going to be at that at the end of time."
"Speaker 5","01;22;36;03","01;23;08;05","This is the minority of examples most assemble most model always that and off a lot more messy other than that and that's what this trying to basically answer given that you have a lot of messy with cells can be different things and then if perturbations happen like they happen all the time in environment and often we do see that you know mis formed embryos now that we saw in the lab and labs to a to we sit in nature all the time where you guys completely different outcomes are followed here even though not all of these occur because of some genetic mutation."
"Speaker 5","01;23;08;05","01;23;27;09","That's not always the case sometimes it's just basically touch base in that environment and the same genetic code of some the differences that was here. It's basically the differences here between one simulation and different if you did it that way, we didn't. But if you did this not in this paper, if you had different analyzation initially of the beliefs leaves, you can also get different outcomes."
"Speaker 5","01;23;27;09","01;23;48;25","But even with one randomization off of the initial beliefs, you will get certain outcomes for those cell types based on on the coding, but also on what the environment does that's the kind of the the goal is you have cell types. You have you want to see what how can you change the line of cell type differentiation based on the interplay?"
"Speaker 5","01;23;48;25","01;23;57;09","Not just like saying you do that and you tell the cells to do this, but based on how they interact with each other of the answer, the question."
"Speaker 1","01;24;01;23","01;24;09;24","It makes me think of Washington's landscape, the epigenetic landscape, which all copy. And how would you say it relates to epigenetics? Or the epigenetic."
"Speaker 5","01;24;10;24","01;24;22;17","Traits so if I have my shirt here, I have a shirt with it. I don't see it right now. Yeah, I love the what is in it. Yeah, that's exactly right. So that that was a big I love you big enough."
"Speaker 1","01;24;23;11","01;24;25;23","I'll put it onto a slide here."
"Speaker 5","01;24;26;08","01;24;44;17","The basically the right the whole the whole evolution was that initially when we started understanding genetic information that it was thought, oh, well, that's, that's the end of it. Now we know what we've done here. Like we know basically that there's some certain things also surface and then you will get certain genes for the signals down but basically from that, it's all old, straightforward."
"Speaker 5","01;24;44;26","01;25;13;15","What was new then later on was that part of it? Those basically actually modifications happening more on the like you did not just mutations of the genome, but which genes were more or less accessible for expression which you know can so basically you kept the coding the same but based on modifications, some modifications. Right. The way that the chromosomes for the DNA is wrapped around itself and chromosomes, the more or less tightly they're called to each other, the more or less accessible to transcription factors."
"Speaker 5","01;25;14;19","01;25;53;02","And that side of the basically happening later on. Now we think a lot more about this and we even see this even that's heritable and it's, it's, it's also interactive with life more the physical forces of it. So patients in that in the mechanical or biological environments will lead to a lot faster epigenetic transformations. And how is that so it's important to mention that it's a lot faster process is faster to basically modify some of the proteins that make up the histones and then make up the accessibility of the gene code than to start off going some evolution experiment experimentally such mutating and cross over until we get the right combination."
"Speaker 5","01;25;53;02","01;26;38;07","So it's a different layer of information flow that is interactive, which neck level so what this paper kind of interacts that a little bit, you know, intersects with it is the aspect of health in that initial kind of formation where you have the same time code within basically one lifetime. How do certain modifications and and sensory perception which you can think of right it I didn't make a claim I hate to make claims that are not actually then asked was answering in some relevant biological mechanism but I could think of easily that way that use this that this modifications of the the the the response function that sets the sensitivity of the of the experiments"
"Speaker 5","01;26;38;07","01;27;06;18","and the mis the which use sensitivity and the cancer initiation. Those could easily be thought of as as you know short term epigenetic modifications and we do set a lot to happen, especially in stress environments and embryos and stressful environments. And then beyond Genesis where we're just very quickly is change to address the outcomes and it's thought of as a, as a quick response mechanism to to basically let your patients and and it's evolved as of course in Kansas."
"Speaker 5","01;27;06;18","01;27;22;14","Well that's that's well known so that's kind of how I would think about that. The landscape years can be thought of as the version of science landscape in the sense of like what different outcomes you can get, how, how, how quickly to update your, your probably based on the changes in the environment."
"Speaker 1","01;27;24;02","01;27;25;18","Awesome. Thank you, Dean."
"Speaker 4","01;27;28;08","01;27;59;17","When I was reading this, I was thinking of a company that I'm invested in that has taken stem cell derived isolates because people have diabetes and they have created an environment to protect against a perturbation. So instead of injecting those pancreatic cells directly into the portal vein, they tried to and they have working on trying to sort of create the environment in which the islets survive."
"Speaker 4","01;27;59;18","01;28;28;17","So so essentially it's again, rather than looking from the bottom up, it's it's sort of creating that safe environment in which these islets can then carry out their function. And so that's what I was kind of thinking about throughout when I was reading your paper. Now, I'm not sure if that again, whether I was thinking of the correct analogy, but but yeah, in terms of what the pancreatic islets can do depends on their survivability."
"Speaker 4","01;28;28;17","01;28;50;10","So if you don't have the right kind of environment for that, they tend to die or worse, they don't die, they become cancerous. So it's kind of interesting that you're looking at it here. And then I know of some sort of practical application where the research is really trying to build these environments so that they can actually protect against the perturbations."
"Speaker 5","01;28;50;20","01;28;53;12","Yeah, no, that's exactly the online side of thinking as well."
"Speaker 5","01;28;55;14","01;29;01;06","I just I had like two more minutes and I just watched them go on."
"Speaker 1","01;29;01;16","01;29;14;21","Really appreciated you joining if it works for you to drop in or at any point in the dark to please feel welcome and any other time you or anyone else are welcome to participate. But thanks a lot for joining You're welcome."
"Speaker 5","01;29;14;22","01;29;15;06","My pleasure."
"Speaker 1","01;29;15;23","01;29;17;26","See you later. OK."
"Speaker 3","01;29;19;04","01;29;26;12","Bye bye. Thank you. Excellent. That was great. Fantastic. Great."
"Speaker 1","01;29;27;00","01;29;52;28","Yeah. Fun times. OK, so here's here's one thought on the relationship with foraging, kind of picking up on what we were just looking at. So you described some of the manipulations as kind of like interventions that were epigenetic so it wasn't the addition of like another changing of models structure like changing their from four to five transcription factors."
"Speaker 1","01;29;54;12","01;30;23;09","It was just changing their state. It's like picking one cell up and moving. It would be changing its position. But then there's other levers of intervention, like changing its sensitivity or other aspects of its cognitive or its generative model. And the whole point with science and active inference though, see, anticipating brain is not a scientist by paper, so it's not exactly the same thing, but it's about informed or directed experimentation."
"Speaker 1","01;30;24;00","01;30;55;17","And that's true from the epistemic foraging with the ice skating to the scientific experiments when we make targeted interventions into systems based upon a good understanding of them, we can learn about the cognitive model that's underlying it or the as if cognitive model. So there's a lot of interventions that would not be informative about morphogenesis, like jokingly, you know, hitting the petri dish with a hammer."
"Speaker 1","01;30;55;26","01;31;21;24","It's, it's an intervention that does kill cells, it kills cancer. But of course, is not the joke right? Like there needs to be more to it in the experimental design and in the the measurement of the outcomes so that we're actually learning something and so to make increasingly nuanced designs and learn more and more and apply better and better, that's where having like this kind of formal modeling really matters."
"Speaker 1","01;31;22;06","01;32;07;04","So this is kind of taking just saying like, well, changes in receptors might be a precursor or a biomarker or early mechanistic warning of X disease. You'll read that 100,000 times in the molecular biology literature. And this is picking up there and putting it into a modeling architecture where we actually can talk about changes in signaling and position in an integrated way so that it might be able to actually model real settings, just like people use the epigenetic landscape here mystically, but also increasingly quantitatively to model self-pay decisions, but just to kind of close that against the interventions that we as the investigator know, based upon our understanding of like the natural history of the"
"Speaker 1","01;32;07;04","01;32;33;21","system that give us updates on our cognitive model of the system. So like an ant foraging example is they'll take a desert ant that forages alone, the decimate goes out without following, like just simply a pheromones trail and pick the ant up when it's like, let's just say 30 meters away from the nest or 20 meters away and then move it to like 90 degrees, rotated the same distance."
"Speaker 1","01;32;34;17","01;33;12;09","So one extreme case would be it continues from that location. 100% as if it were walking back from the north. Let's just say that would be a pure direction step integrator model there might be an angle that takes between that and for example, heading towards the nest that might reflect the usage of other sensory or cognitive features, like detecting the polarization of light or seeing memory or other ways that it might be able to adjust and turn its vector to some other direction."
"Speaker 1","01;33;13;10","01;33;52;02","So that's the kind of experiment where we can start to learn, like how much are the the estimates in their foraging adjusting between their own onboard memory versus these external cues that might be picked up like in one instance by an investment in that location? So there's some cells where moving it into a different tissue, the first thing it would do is die because it's just like too acidic or just like not a good environment for it, but there are certain interventions that do seem to happen that lead to at the very least we can say states we don't prefer or just more directly like states that are abnormal or unhealthy, though it really does"
"Speaker 1","01;33;52;02","01;34;09;01","come back all to Blue's question about death and aging and how is that related and what is this living phase between the developmental part and the death part? Even though there's such a complex continuum between them?"
"Speaker 3","01;34;10;23","01;34;46;28","Stephen can I just ask a question on what you were just saying, that then you do you feel that or do you think that the the level of what's happening with epigenetics is fairly flat? And and then once these other types of changes these types of changes happen, that the adjacencies permeate out and can the cells kind of find in their place and is that a bit different to the nastiness, you know, that we're talking about?"
"Speaker 3","01;34;46;28","01;35;20;27","The massiveness is because like, for instance, a tissue or or is that also does it then fall into some other type of behavior where it's like in this idea of the nested the nested kind of Michael blankets and is it then a case of what was the types of information flows which were conservation at one scale become noise that made sense."
"Speaker 3","01;35;20;28","01;35;25;23","And maybe I'm just curious about if that is in here."
"Speaker 1","01;35;27;14","01;36;02;09","OK it very well might I mean but it just makes me think about the I specification in fruit flies and and similar in other insects. So this is like an example of a developmental genetics pathway at a relatively downstream level being worked out through a lot of work. But these cells are pre-committed to being a precursor cells, but then they undergo a second or a future stage of differentiation that results in a compound dye."
"Speaker 1","01;36;02;21","01;36;46;25","And then it's the modularity of this developmental framing of first AI precursor cell and then to a specified I compound so that let's take the insect I scale in different ways. For example, in the mammal I development only. So over evolutionary time, there's different affordances for insect evolution versus mammalian cell evolution because they're on different pathways. So it's kind of fractal because this I fields precursor, it's not the second one that comes out of the embryo so there's multiple like fractal layers and pre-commit plays and it's not possible to jump from a canyon way at the bottom directly over."
"Speaker 1","01;36;47;02","01;37;25;01","There's a few cancer cell papers that do a little bit more of like a reversion and around or a perturbation that pushes and then changes to like susceptibility or kind of like changes in the elevation of these hills between. So it's a landscape which isn't just simply flat, it has some scale. And then the relationship between how jagged it is and how much noise or flow there is, is about how navigable that landscape is in that one model blue."
"Speaker 2","01;37;29;14","01;37;55;23","So I have a question for Daniel and Dean specifically. So when France was here, he talked about the block matrix operator that he used in Equation 39. And you guys well, maybe it was Daniel specifically we're talking about some kind of housekeeping term in the dot zero. And I couldn't remember or place the housekeeping term that you were referring to."
"Speaker 2","01;37;55;23","01;38;00;22","And I wondered if it was like the same or similar in a similar or used in a similar way."
"Speaker 4","01;38;01;18","01;38;02;12","I think it's Connor."
"Speaker 1","01;38;02;25","01;38;42;26","I'll bring in a house keeping term slide. It was from 32,032 Stochastic Chaos, Markov Blankets and here is the slides in slide 45 here. Yeah it was basically the Helmholtz decomposition is usually discussed in terms of just the gradient, the solenoid or so sort of like directed term. And then the ISO contour circulation change in elevation ruler on the Hill and then around the hill on a second tour and then this paper."
"Speaker 1","01;38;43;07","01;39;09;21","32 brought in the housekeeping term and then there was like a supplement. So we didn't really totally go into it. But together they represent the total flow. So it's a slight kind of first a variation on the Helmholtz decomposition in this context. But as Connor mentioned, and 32.3, it also has like sort of antecedents and maybe even similarities with other areas."
"Speaker 1","01;39;09;26","01;39;31;07","So totally remains to be a little bit unpacked. But it's the influence of how movement changes the landscape. At least that's a little bit how we are framing it like change on a trampoline where the movement is going to influence it. You can't just snapshot the landscape and then calculate what would happen and what the gradient in the solenoid or flow would be at every point because it's going to be the future."
"Speaker 2","01;39;32;06","01;39;55;18","That might be related to what Franz was saying, because he said that he used it to smooth out the landscape because otherwise you get stuck in like a little local pocket when you're talking about like, you know, something that's bumpy so it sounds like it could be a similar type of like housekeeping thing or just like a smoothing smoothing this when you're when you're going into the bowl you don't want to get stuck in the bump down along the way, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;39;55;27","01;39;58;19","If you're marble traveling down, like if this thing."
"Speaker 4","01;39;58;21","01;39;59;15","Was a cleanse."
"Speaker 1","01;40;01;03","01;40;31;21","So there's just too much, too many jokes to be made. But well, I think in our last, you know, ten ish minutes, we should just chill, land the plane, prepare for to it was pretty unexpected and awesome to have the time that we got to speak. And I think that's like the housekeeping term in action. Which is a process and a protocol."
"Speaker 1","01;40;32;08","01;41;01;04","And then people who have different perspectives on a situation. But the group can always readapt to a changing landscape. And so even if that's interpreted as structure learning at a higher level from the sort of agent view looking up, it's equivalent to adapting to a different situation in some fractal way, slightly different or very different, using the same affordances and perceptive and cognitive features as it had in the time step before."
"Speaker 1","01;41;01;28","01;41;59;07","And that's why this model that looks at the flow of the autonomous states, so the states that can actually be controlled in the mark, a blanket partition in 30 by defining a specific function that we want to like be fitting. Well, by really focusing on the flow over the blanket and internal states, it allows inference on that component perception, cognition and action of the given models entity to be uncoupled in a certain way from inference on the hidden external state evolution, which is fundamentally unknowable but in a slightly different way if that makes any sense."
"Speaker 1","01;42;05;11","01;42;30;14","And a classic moment blue to suggest that the mitotic elements and like just to bring in the continuity and then the way that that gives rise to symmetry breaking sort of for free and that this and so cool conversation that we had today and so."
"Speaker 2","01;42;31;11","01;42;31;16","I."
"Speaker 1","01;42;31;16","01;42;32;25","Did as a thought one might."
"Speaker 2","01;42;34;01","01;42;57;00","I didn't get to mention that I was going to mention it but like you know there's that fractal ephemeral brain pattern paper that I'm like dying to read and would love to discuss with the authors. Also but it's interesting just in terms of the fractal dimension also that Frances talking about is super cool um."
"Speaker 1","01;42;58;19","01;43;15;21","Is there anything else that we want to like? Um, write down to think about in the data or questions that we'd like to ask Frans if he returns or just things that we want to take moving forward in the dart to already."
"Speaker 2","01;43;20;11","01;43;21;21","Know that one."
"Speaker 1","01;43;22;10","01;43;26;23","Yeah, I agree. It's like, it's like you're eating dinner. It's like, what do you want to do tomorrow?"
"Speaker 1","01;43;29;11","01;43;40;29","Inverting space and time we didn't really get to. And some of these initial points, it was right, least action math and morphology and generalized flow and taking us all the way back."
"Speaker 2","01;43;41;15","01;44;13;00","So I would like to maybe ask, ask friends about quantum mechanics and what role, if any, that that's played in. Like what is there a quantum perspective that he was perhaps viewing in from when he was writing this paper? I would like to ask just that one question, because that will encompass inverting space and time and it will encompass what we talked about with the probability current and the probability mass conservation."
"Speaker 2","01;44;13;14","01;44;22;28","So like that all is like bridging into the quantum where we'll go in the 40. So I think I would like to ask that one thing."
"Speaker 1","01;44;24;05","01;44;27;08","Dean, what are you like looking forward to what would you want to add here?"
"Speaker 4","01;44;27;10","01;44;50;05","And I'm just going to go back to the drawing board and basically look, look a little more closely at some of those math operations because I don't tend to give those as much attention as I need to. I think it's really interesting now that we've got a chance to sort of bring more people into the conversation. I think I think there's three parts."
"Speaker 4","01;44;50;12","01;45;21;02","I think we can agree there are three things that we can really center on now. There's the the formally form forming, which is what figure four and five do. But as soon as you go to figure five, what's interesting is, is that the attention seems to be on the shape that the cells eventually take. And yet in that in the sort of in the blackness around each one of those moment captures, there's there's signaling and there's changing."
"Speaker 4","01;45;21;02","01;45;38;01","Right? There's so there's all the part we've talked about today, which is the whole flowing piece and what where is it going and how is it channeling and how is it narrowing or how is it spreading and how is it dissipating and all that stuff. But in those even in those diagrams, it's hard to figure out where the signal is."
"Speaker 4","01;45;38;01","01;46;10;10","Even when they introduce arrows, they introduce the arrow pointing at the form not the necessarily the signaling in the changing. And that's where the math really comes in, I think, because without the math, you you lose sight of those other two present factors that are, you know, all moving and mixing and and turning into something so I hope Prince comes back because, man, he's got a heck of a lot more."
"Speaker 4","01;46;11;20","01;46;40;01","He's got a lot more to tell us about really, because this is such a dense paper, like I think I mentioned to you, Daniel, before, before the point zero, this could be a 13 week course, this one paper, if you really wanted to I don't know how many hours he spent on this, but he already admitted that going to Carl's lab and and from the lab he's at there's way more multiples of 10000 hours of work that were done before he started taping things out so yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;46;41;23","01;47;10;23","Awesome with that made me like think about is this idea of like multiple kinds of invisibility or overlay or unpacking like projection up into a bigger dimension of interpretation. Like you pointed out how the like the focus was on morphology, which is to say the final realized like this picture is of the morphology of the animal. It's not of the signaling density, but this could be like presented."
"Speaker 1","01;47;10;23","01;47;36;02","That's just a gradient of transcription factor A or it could be presented as a gradient of vitamin A or like it's kind of like Carillion photography, like looking at the morphology with the energy field. I don't know if that's exactly what it is, but that sort of idea with that, the field based perspective. But then it gets hard to show many overlaying fields because like what do you do?"
"Speaker 1","01;47;36;03","01;47;57;25","20 overlaying colors, but we can't actually see that. And so that's just kind of interesting, like a question about visualization of higher dimensional models with a lot of overlays. And then that's like one kind of invisibility, which is something that's modeled but just not graphically shown easily, like the density of 50 pheromones or 50 transcription factors or vitamins."
"Speaker 1","01;47;58;14","01;48;31;15","But then also but, but it does exist and it's like modeled as an actual chemical component of the biological system, like the generative process. And then there's this generative model with mathematical derivatives the generalized coordinates of motion of cellular position. And those are also like invisible in a different way because they're a modeling tool and the derivatives are not anywhere in reality like what is where's the seventh derivative of the baseballs?"
"Speaker 1","01;48;31;15","01;48;59;16","Movements, just relative to what? Where is it hiding in the current moment? This is just a purely tool driven way of thinking about the current moment, not just in terms of its composition and like anatomy and position and the lowest level of the observed model, but like these higher levels which are real yet not existing in the moment, structurally real in the structural realism sense."
"Speaker 4","01;49;00;11","01;49;08;03","I'll take your word for it. I've been wanting to say that for a long I have to go back and figure it out."
"Speaker 1","01;49;08;03","01;49;47;23","So but what a discussion I hope, like for those who stick around to the end here, that they enjoyed this, that this wasn't just on total, total morpho past Raphe All right. Well, fun times and awesome to have all the good discussions and appreciate everybody who was here. Blue and Stephen and Dean. So see you all next week or any other time that you."
"Speaker 1","01;49;48;00","01;49;48;13","Bye."
"Speaker 4","01;49;48;19","01;49;49;18","Thank you. Bye."
