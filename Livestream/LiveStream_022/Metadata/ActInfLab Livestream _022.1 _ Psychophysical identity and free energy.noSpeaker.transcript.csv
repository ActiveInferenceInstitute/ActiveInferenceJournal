"Unknown","00;00;09;11","00;00;43;07","OK. Hello and welcome everyone to Active Lab. This is the Active Lab. Live stream and I'm pretty sure alive. Yes, we are. It's number 22.1 on May 18th. 2021 And this is going to be really great discussion, so I'm looking forward to it. And thanks again, everyone, for joining life. Welcome to Active Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;43;23","00;01;08;22","You can find us at the links that are here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good livestream etiquette. Welcome, Scott. And raising our hands to ask questions and hear from everybody because this is really going to be a special discussion."
"Unknown","00;01;10;04","00;01;34;24","We're here in paper number 22 and on May 18th today and next week on the 25th we're going to be having two discussions on the paper Psychophysical Identity and Free Energy by Alex Kieffer. So thanks a lot Alex for joining us live and engaging with the zero video because we gained a lot as a lab working through that. And so we're ready to take it to the next level through conversation with you."
"Unknown","00;01;35;19","00;02;02;25","Thank you. And today we're going to be learning and discussing the papers. Link is here and the video is just us unpacking and exploring, raising questions and we're going to be also taking notes so that in the data we can be following up, we're going to start with some introductions just to introduce ourselves and also maybe to raise any thoughts or questions that we had at the outset about the paper."
"Unknown","00;02;02;25","00;02;27;24","So everyone can feel free to write down points or write down questions so they don't forget them. And we're pretty much just going to jump around to any topic or question that drives us along and we'll flow with it as people join and leave. And there will be a follow up discussion. 22 next week that brings us to the introductions and the warm ups."
"Unknown","00;02;28;11","00;02;53;24","So all start it will pass it around and then end up with Alex, who will provide, I think, a short introduction to the paper and then we'll continue the discussion from there. So I'm Daniel, I'm a postdoc in California. And something I'm so excited about today was something we were just speaking about right before was learning about a transparent code and understanding what that might mean."
"Unknown","00;02;54;11","00;03;31;29","I'll pass it to Scott Hello. I'm Scott. David. I'm at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab, where I run a program called the Information Risk and Synthetic Intelligence Research Initiative. And I'm delighted to be here today. And I'll pass it to Stephen Hello. I'm Stephen. I'm based in Toronto. I'm doing a practice based Ph.D., Canterbury, Christchurch, and I'm really excited about this psycho physical areas being brought in with this process with energy."
"Unknown","00;03;31;29","00;04;04;12","So I'm intrigued because that connects to some of the research I do with community using their landscape and how to understand that. So thank you. And I'm going to pass it over to Alex thanks. Hi, everyone. I'm Alex Napkin. I'm a researcher and systems management school from Moscow, Russia, and also co-organizer of Acting of Love. And today in hi, I'm Tina up here in Calgary, Canada."
"Unknown","00;04;04;24","00;04;29;08","I'm retired and I just try to keep up with everybody here. I'll pass it to our special guest today. Alex is Dave. No, Dave, this left. OK, button. You OK, Alex? Hey, thanks. Yeah, I'm Alex. Keefer. I'm a researcher in philosophy and cognitive science, and I did some modeling as well and I have an affiliation with Monash University currently."
"Unknown","00;04;29;08","00;04;54;25","Also a lot of my time is devoted to working for Nested Mind Solutions, which is an enterprise started by a Maxwell Ramstad and some other people just recently. But we've already got a lot of work under our belt, so I'm really happy to be here. Thanks thanks for having me. This is, I think, going to be a really fun discussion cool."
"Unknown","00;04;55;10","00;05;38;07","Maybe just while the other participants are preparing a thought or a question to lead off. Alex, just how did you come to writing this single author paper? What in your path led you to write it this way? Yeah, sure. So so this is an idea that I think first sort of came up for me in 20, 15 or so so I've been fascinated by this formal analogy between optimization and processes in thermodynamics physics for a long time since well, not that long, maybe 20, 12, 20, 13, when I started getting into the neural net literature on impulse machines and things like that."
"Unknown","00;05;38;21","00;06;03;04","And so I think this this analogy between physics and optimization has been tempting for a lot of people to want to collapse these. Right? And this is something that people like my friend Mel Andrews constantly warn against is like just taking the physical informational description of a system to be the same as its physical description. But I thought that there was a compelling argument to be made here."
"Unknown","00;06;03;05","00;06;28;13","So I wanted to actually articulate, not necessarily endorse. Right. And I think the way I couch things in the papers is a bit cautious on this, but I wanted to articulate what is the most sort of the simplest, most kind of perhaps radical perspective one could take on this. The relationship between the cognitive dynamics and the physical dynamics that you might be able to defend, right."
"Unknown","00;06;28;14","00;06;49;03","From a sort of free energy principle ish perspective so I wanted to to just lay that that one way of understanding this relationship out that was that was as clear as possible. I think in the process. I ended up writing a paper that many people find to be quite complicated. So this was supposed to be an exposition of a simple idea."
"Unknown","00;06;49;17","00;07;16;19","So maybe we can see if we can get back to that awesome. So anyone can raise their hand and we'll just start. But I really liked how you said articulate but not endorse. You've put out an artifact for us to interact with and to explore, and you have framed the psychophysical identity thesis as a hypothesis. So it's something that evidence can now be used to support or to disprove."
"Unknown","00;07;16;28","00;07;47;26","And that's sort of a nice piece of work that now obviously we have started a discussion around. So we'll go to Steven and then Scott and then anyone else with the reduced hands yeah. One thing I like about what you're doing here is you're sort of bringing it into the domains where the action is happening. It's a bit like most of the physics around thermodynamics is really often used in chemistry and a lot like Niels Bohr was actually a chemist, wasn't a physicist per say."
"Unknown","00;07;47;26","00;08;16;10","He used physics so there's an interesting thing about how these areas get transposed over, you know, and maybe lead again to biochemistry, which maybe is trying to look at the mechanisms that sit on that and X, Y, Z. So I think that's quite relevant to some of the questions we've been wrestling with was what happens when things start to transit, transition to the ontology, like at the how how can you keep a handle on that when you've got people from different backgrounds?"
"Unknown","00;08;16;10","00;08;57;18","So I think that's quite interesting. Awesome. Thank you. Stephen Scott and anyone else with a raised hand yeah. I'd like to just ask about your having written the paper and now contemplated it, discussed it with folks what's your impression of the role of the observer of difference of, of gaps of difference is in identifying sources of free energy exploitable sources."
"Unknown","00;08;57;18","00;09;28;05","Let me, let me back up one. I did a paper in presentation in the MIT in 2013 called Entropy Accounting and I asserted that Carnot is equation the hot and cold differentials that are reflected there are the same as arbitrage equations in markets because you and I asserted that heat engines were produced by the human mind observing an attribute because it didn't matter that we thought we had a flow of caloric and it was flowing downhill."
"Unknown","00;09;28;05","00;09;59;02","We actually the notion of flow was what we asserted in order to convert random heat, random motion of particles which we really only use for warmth, being able to put that into a cylinder, a combustion chamber and then perform work took thousands of years. I wonder if you could comment on it feels like we're using information like the cavemen as for warmth and not yet putting it in a combustion chamber and the combustion."
"Unknown","00;09;59;10","00;10;27;19","Is it the fact that the processes were different tools are captured, exploited, utilized? I'm not sure what word to use here. Is that in like a reaction chamber, are we reacting observations and data into inference in these reaction chambers of mind similar to the differentials that we exploit to a heat engine for work, are we able to capture what are the devices of capture?"
"Unknown","00;10;27;19","00;10;57;15","Sorry for the long question, right? Yeah. Your hand on your chin makes me think that maybe it's an intriguing question. It's it's definitely intriguing. I probably can't do justice to it, but I'll try. So just on the last point, I guess I think that the well, actually so first to take your your question about information, whether we're using it so sort of like whether we're really exploiting it to its maximum possibilities, right?"
"Unknown","00;10;57;17","00;11;30;20","As information or just we're just treating it as sort of, you know, something like want a source of warmth. I mean, I take it that insofar as we're using information so right. So it gets to the heart of my perspective and to this perspective of this paper, I guess. So I said I followed this thesis as a possibility, but I do kind of have some sort of deep seated conviction that that information can always be looked at sort of in terms of what it represents and physically."
"Unknown","00;11;30;20","00;11;58;08","Right. So any process of information, information is literally a process of physical change as well as as well as a process of some system coming to know something. Right. So to take the etymology, right, just go back to Shannon's original framing information is just the amount by which someone or something has been informed and you. So so I think insofar as we're treating something as information, we are using it as information, right?"
"Unknown","00;11;58;12","00;12;29;26","It's not now I don't know what the analogy. Maybe I would love to hear more from you on this. I don't know what the analogy would be to using information just as heat is it like we're aware of something but we're not really doing anything with it, like in terms of inference or so. So I guess my, my view is that we are insofar as we're thinking and exploiting information sources for inference, we're using it to it's maybe not maximally, efficiently always, but we're using it in a way that's that's intelligent but but just one more point on this."
"Unknown","00;12;29;26","00;12;59;25","Like the analogy to the combustion engine and like that, the idea of like I guess my thesis here is that any time we're performing an inference, any systems performing an inference there, the physical aspect of that is something like it is an actual physical reaction. So there is always something that has precisely that nature behind any use of information."
"Unknown","00;13;01;01","00;13;26;12","But I think everything I just said sounds to me completely trivial as I'm saying it. So that's its power. Yes. Ahead. What did you mean? We can unpack that because it's not the power. It is not just simply wasted, but where there's a heat differential, there can be work. And potentially where there's an information differential, there can be an analogy to physical work."
"Unknown","00;13;26;12","00;14;05;21","But in the informational regime. So what motivates your line of thinking for you? Yeah, it was well, and again, I'll send around these slides from 2013, but with the idea was that it is not by analogy, it really is a capturing by the mind of an attribute of a system right. You look at a block of iron, it has spin, it has temperature, it has color, there's all sorts of dimensions that it has that are unexploited and then we can look at them and exploit them for, you know, magnetism with spin and then temperature, electronic electrons flow through iron, same block iron, it's just sitting there, but you measure different attributes and as you measure"
"Unknown","00;14;05;21","00;14;25;04","different attributes, you measure them into existence and that existence then can be exploited. And so we did that with heat, right? They thought that heat was caloric. They actually thought it was a fluid right? And that but then the guy who was the cannonball or I forget which one, the guy who board the brass cannons, he said, wait a second, it can't be a fluid because it's unlimited."
"Unknown","00;14;25;04","00;14;46;09","It's a quality of the material. So I think what we're talking about in information, it's a quality not of the brain of them, it's quality of the mind. And the differential between the brain and the mind. There's a there's a mind out there to be learned. Let's call it an environment if it's animals, but if it's humans, it also involves language."
"Unknown","00;14;46;20","00;15;08;27","And when you're born, you don't know it, and then you go learn it. So your brain has to get tuned into the mind. So to me, the mind is our combustion chamber, and you've got to learn the combustion. Now, if you don't if you're different, learn different things about a hunter gatherer, I'm going to learn different things in my environment to combust right I'm going to have different cues and say, Wow, this is relevant for me because I got to do this and this."
"Unknown","00;15;09;08","00;15;35;29","So the we train I think we train our combustion chamber. It's symbolic right? As we're training this thing in which to contain the differential accomplishment of the active inference, the Bayesian accomplishment, and then we train. So it was an article in just the last thing. I'll shut up for a minute. There's an article in Nature magazine a couple of years ago, they said less than 12 month old human infants learn in a Bayesian way."
"Unknown","00;15;35;29","00;16;03;10","If you point to a if you tell a baby a horse has four legs, the baby will point to a table coffee table and say, horsey then you say, No, Scott just disappeared. It was too much of a truth draw with the table and the legs. So Steven, to you and we'll return to Scott when we can they please."
"Unknown","00;16;03;20","00;16;20;21","Sorry. OK, so Scott's back. You continue with OK, continue from the table. More like yeah. Anyways, Bayesian, Bayesian accumulation the point to a table. Then you say you know how hair they'll point to a dog and say horsey. Then you say, no, it has to have a mean. They'll point to a horse and say horses. So it's a Bayesian."
"Unknown","00;16;20;27","00;16;45;12","The article is about Bayesian assembly of human knowledge. And so what if the baby is not really assembling knowledge? We're just tuning their brain into the mind and the minds are combustion chamber and the mind we teach. We have to learn the mind because that's the useful combustion we've already designed, designed this community mind to navigate space, and we teach it to our offspring in order to make them more fit anywhere else."
"Unknown","00;16;46;14","00;17;10;14","Cool. Thank you. Interesting. Any thoughts on that, Alex? Well, it's interesting. I don't know if I completely understand the way Scott's using the term mind here, but I think I kind of can see how something that deserves to be called the mind would emerge through this sort of learning process. Right. So, so I guess there's a trivial sense, I think, in which anything that has energetic properties has a mental side."
"Unknown","00;17;10;24","00;17;41;20","That's kind of what I'm saying in the paper, but it's trivial. And if you want something that really functions cognitively, then you need to have internalized a lot of these regularities through the sorts of learning and infant schemes that we're all familiar with here. So if that's what you mean by learning the mind, I think, Scott, you guys analogized it to the environment at some point, or maybe it's more than an analogy, it's like the, the, the data, the source of the data, sensory data that you're interpreting."
"Unknown","00;17;43;00","00;18;25;23","So yeah, I think it's a, it's a cool idea. Oh, Stephen, welcome Blue Stephen with a question and then anyone else with a question or blue you can say hello. Now one question I'm interested in is do you see maybe more than one type of information processing that may be happening at different levels so maybe you've got because we've had people talk and say at the quantum level, which could be happening particularly say the photons coming in with the iris and things going up and then you've got other levels where you've got these steady states going at different rates and then you've got some of the things you're talking about where maybe it goes into"
"Unknown","00;18;25;23","00;18;57;17","the this sense of a more averaged close mind idea, which would have to be somehow created, maybe because the dynamical nature of the data in the noise is not necessarily exactly how it is when it first arrives at the organism, but maybe you're bringing back some of that more averaged out heat ideas around how energy can be averaged over time in some sort of heat form."
"Unknown","00;18;57;17","00;19;37;09","Is that would that be accurate? I'm not sure about the heat. I'm just genuinely not sure we can talk more about it. But like as far as multiple, multiple types of information processing, I mean, I think that's definitely what's happening in the you know, in the brain. Of course, that there's all this literature on multi scale active inference and stuff, which by paper isn't directly about active inference, but I think there's no so we tend to single out certain processes in the brain is like processing information, but really that's going on, you know, on fine grained levels and on larger scales."
"Unknown","00;19;37;09","00;19;57;22","As you say, I think we tend to just pick out one piece to analyze at a time. I guess the part of the question I don't know how to answer is what, what, what are the types of information processing in question so I guess I'm, I'm skeptical of that type distinction, not against it. I'm just not sure what what kind of types you have in mind."
"Unknown","00;19;57;22","00;20;26;24","But definitely, I think there's a there's a role for averaging just if we even if we just stick to neurons and don't worry about the underlying chemistry of physics like it can't just be that one neuron firing represents your grandmother because then if that neurons shot, then you can't represent your grandmother. So I think there has to be if we want to associate content with brain states, for example, those states are going to have to be couched at the level of averages."
"Unknown","00;20;27;09","00;20;50;06","Some in some sense or some kind of statistical property. And I think that comes out fairly also in the work that first in Bunia and others have done on the whole, Mark will be in Might as an idea. So they talk about the fact that it's, you know, it's, it's not individual brain states that encode information and their view."
"Unknown","00;20;50;06","00;21;25;29","It's, it's the mean of a distribution, conditional distribution. Anyway, going a bit into the weeds on this but I I do think that that's important. He I don't know. Let's talk more about it. Yeah Keith we had the what is temperature slide which I'll just yeah. To Steve do you have any other thoughts. Well again just that slide and maybe just as just sort of following from that is maybe something about the mind and the level of the psychophysical maybe actually the mind is kind of psychophysical level as we think of as a brain level."
"Unknown","00;21;25;29","00;21;49;18","But maybe what you're pointing to is something a bit more of a dynamic, which is kind of interesting. Yeah. I mean, I generally sorry, I generally have trouble seeing distinctions between levels, so. Right, so maybe that's what, you know, you, you could help point out like why these things are not the same and would it help me go ahead."
"Unknown","00;21;49;29","00;22;17;06","Hence the psychophysical identity thesis paper that you wrote, right? Because that's the entire topic. Of this discussion is what are those relationships and are they like each other or are they overlapping? Are they isomorphic are one in the same so here on this temperature slide, you wrote about how increases and decreases in temperature change, the variance of distributions."
"Unknown","00;22;17;16","00;22;48;27","So maybe just what is temperature or in this psychophysical identity mapping, what does temperature reflect? Because changing the temperature on the brain, you're not just talking about going into a warmer room, you're talking about something related to inference. So what is happening there? Well, right. I mean, I guess I can say like, look, if you change the temperature in the room and that ends up changing the temperature of the brain, then it's kind of an implication of the thesis that you are changing the temperature of your statistical model as well to some degree, right?"
"Unknown","00;22;48;27","00;23;30;03","Probably usually to an imperceptible or insignificant degree when something like walking into a different room because then the brain has its own internal homeostasis. And it's not like we're going to drastically, directly affect the brain's internal temperature by changing the room temperature one degree. But I really you know, speculating or I'm considering the consequences of I mean, the overall theme here and temperature's a special case, but the overall theme is that anything that you want like so any of the terms of the Helmholtz energy from from physics, from the hammocks, should directly this is a transparent encoding idea."
"Unknown","00;23;30;03","00;23;58;12","It should directly sort of be reflected in the cognitive dynamics. And so that cognitively speaking, what temperature means, like it says this here is just, you know, temperature parameters in models, neural network models and other sorts of models I think I've heard this referred to in the active inference literature as as the shaky hand parameter, right? So it's like you're reaching for something, you increase the temperature parameter, there's less certainty in exactly where the motor system will end up."
"Unknown","00;23;58;18","00;24;28;06","Right? So that's that's what it means cognitively speaking. Or if you don't want to call motor control, low level motor control, cognitive, then in terms of these models of organisms, what it means is just literally just the variability of the distribution right? The variance. So I guess what I'm saying is, yes, I think if this thesis is true, then what encodes that is the actual temperature of the system that implements the model."
"Unknown","00;24;29;26","00;24;58;28","Very interesting. Thank you. We'll go to blue and then Scott good morning. I'm Blue and I'm a research consultant based out of New Mexico. And I really enjoyed this paper. I really enjoyed the possibility of having a way to separate the mind from simulations of the mind. I think that that's a really relevant and pertinent idea to put forward, but also in relevance to temperature."
"Unknown","00;24;58;28","00;25;16;29","And this is going to totally throw what I just said out the window. You know, I dabble a little bit in retail investing, right? And so like the day before or maybe in the morning, you might like what's called take the temperature of the market. Right. So you see kind of is things going up or things going down?"
"Unknown","00;25;16;29","00;25;45;23","Like you just kind of put your feelers out there and take the temperature of what the market's going to do. So I just wonder in terms of cognition, in terms of active inference, if there's a way to like take the temperature in and maybe like more of a kind of a metaphorical sense. Right. Does that make sense um, I'm not sure so I can elaborate a little bit more."
"Unknown","00;25;45;23","00;26;25;19","Like what? Like in the political system, right? Like we get like a temperature like is this like a liberal environment or is it like a more conservative environment? And that might influence our actions, right? Like the active inference loop might be influenced by the perception of temperature in the environment. Right. So yeah, I mean, first of all, hi, thanks for joining you and Dan and Daniel, I really enjoyed your discussion in point zero and it made me excited to talk about it today because it's, it's cool how just how many different questions, you know, anyways, whatever."
"Unknown","00;26;25;19","00;26;50;09","It's cool. So I mean, sure, you can use temperature in a metaphorical way as well, like I think like I guess in this paper I tend to I like I tend to assume that when people that that metaphors are not metaphors but identities, right? As the graph, the ground level assumption and then see see where that you're forced to distinguish between them."
"Unknown","00;26;50;22","00;27;14;29","So like if we're talking about again, if we're talking about a model of motor control where you're literally reaching for something, then I think in that case it's plausible that there's some relationship between the actual temperature of the pieces of the system they're driving the motion and the temperature parameter in the model. But like if you're talking about something like taking the temperature of the market or, you know, the political there's still might be partial mappings there."
"Unknown","00;27;15;01","00;27;28;00","Right? Like but, you know, if you're defining some arbitrary dimension. So if the temperature politically means one side of the scale is is conservative and the other side is liberal, then then I wouldn't expect that there'd be some physical component to that."
"Unknown","00;27;30;14","00;27;58;05","But the same way that your paper was, as you said, just putting it out there, not endorsing the psychophysical identity, it's almost like in a kind of physical identity thesis would be asking whether the thermo like dynamics of markets actually have some sort of mapping that's more than a metaphor, but it's something that can be stated and blanketed or boxed off and then can be understood as being adequate in certain situations."
"Unknown","00;27;58;05","00;28;19;04","But maybe inadequate in other situations. But when we talk about the market heating up, people know what that means in a way where, you know, the market feeling happy doesn't really capture it. Heating up or cooling down. So Scott and then anyone else with a raised hand oops and not sure if I should try to share my screen images, a screw ups list."
"Unknown","00;28;19;04","00;28;51;25","I'll do that. But let me so I just pulled up my slides from 2013 and so I said under the first law of thermodynamics, temperature has to roll first from the perspective of a party outside the system. Temperature tells whether two or more systems are in thermal equilibrium. Same temperature equals equilibrium. OK from the perspective of a molecule in this system, temperature tells about the distribution of various molecules in the system over the possible energy states."
"Unknown","00;28;51;25","00;29;18;02","Right. The higher temperature equals a broader distribution of molecules in different states and a higher Boltzmann distribution. So what I'm asserting in this context, in the context of those earlier slides was analogously here are we looking within the system of the cognitive system and the dynamics of components within it, or these would be an outside voice for that system?"
"Unknown","00;29;18;02","00;29;54;04","I think that's a relevant question here because when you're talking about the first law in here, we don't we have this is a minimum. Maxwell's daemon is actually a person sorry, that obscure reference, the Maxwell's Daemon was a convention to sus with the second law of thermodynamics, a gating function. And now we actually have the notion of what does a molecule in the system think in a sense is what I'm inviting here and this."
"Unknown","00;29;54;04","00;30;17;19","And so I think the assertion and the assertion certainly I make in that context is we can capture either one of those dynamics and it's info dynamics or not. Thermodynamics is what I call it. But essentially the first law tells you about interoperability is what my assertion is because you can have equilibrium in a symbolic way, I assert, as equivalence of interoperability and symbolic."
"Unknown","00;30;18;05","00;30;35;27","And so that's when you can have a meeting of the minds. You can have shared consciousness society, shared language, all that kind of stuff is my notion of where the first law takes you thinks that's very intriguing. I need to read your work on this, please."
"Unknown","00;30;38;07","00;30;51;03","Yeah. I mean, not to give a two hand-waving answer, but I think since we're dealing with multiple scales here, we could talk about neurons performing, active inference, people doing it. I think both of those sort of uses of temperature are irrelevant."
"Unknown","00;30;53;14","00;31;16;19","But we can say, Yeah, we'll get to Stephen. But maybe just a general question, where does active inference come into play and how does it come into play? Yeah, so right. So you you guys raised in the point zero that I didn't really talk about active interest that much. In fact, I only referenced the literature on active inference so this is."
"Unknown","00;31;16;28","00;31;46;09","Yeah, it's interesting. This paper isn't really about active inference. It's not really directly about the FFP either. So thank you for having me. Despite that, but it's I mean, obviously it's in it's in the very core. It's concerned with the same core issues. Right. But I don't want to take us on this off as a tangent, but the reason that I don't write about active infants that much is that I think from a high enough or abstract enough point of view we don't need."
"Unknown","00;31;46;09","00;32;10;00","I don't know that there's really a difference that to me active inference kind of relates to the stuff the way that like Dawkins is extended phenotype proposal relates to more traditional ways of thinking about evolution and genetics in that it's a new paradigm. But I don't I don't think that there's a system that you can describe using active inference that you couldn't also describe using, say, traditional representational terminology."
"Unknown","00;32;10;00","00;32;33;20","So that's obviously controversial and we could talk about it, but like insofar as you're as you're concerned with analyzing or designing a system like, right, like if you want to even if you want to write an active inference agent as a model, you only have control over its internal states you can't directly control. It means, yes, it optimizes its situation by acting and intervening on the environment."
"Unknown","00;32;34;07","00;32;59;08","But you can't directly control how the intervention on the environment plays out. You can only control the expectations for sensory data, given that you've acted in such a way. And so that's why I tend to just default to you know, it's what Jerry Potter called methodological solipsism. Right. Which is a very given perspective from what people I think I love to talk about this maybe maybe they're more similar than I think to."
"Unknown","00;32;59;15","00;33;25;04","But anyway, so so like active inference is great. I think in fact, it leads to new ideas for technology and new models just because it's a different way of thinking about things. But when you're doing like philosophical analysis like this, I don't find that it's to me often necessary to think in those terms. But I would love for someone to point out something that I'm missing by not doing that well."
"Unknown","00;33;25;04","00;33;50;14","What we love here in the Active Lab is hearing everyone's perspective on active inference and also adjacencies and synonyms in other languages and other ways of expressing it. So thanks for sharing it the way you did, Steven, if you want to. OK, OK. Yeah. So so building on that, you mentioned the Helmholtz Free Energy rather than the GIBS for energy."
"Unknown","00;33;50;14","00;34;13;07","So you sort of the broader sort of energy that's available. And the I suppose the question I've got here is in this, in that I should go back to that diagram. Just one sec. With the distributions there, you've got just you've got both the difference in the sort of the size of the distribution for the different size molecules."
"Unknown","00;34;13;27","00;34;42;10","But you've got the average speed is higher for hydrogens. So yeah, hydrogen or oxygen is faster, it's the speed is faster for something that's lighter and that may have an impact at the local level when the actual atoms are hitting each other at the same temperature. But when you take the average it's all around the same energy, if that makes sense."
"Unknown","00;34;42;22","00;35;20;01","So just wondered if there's any particular sort of relationship to the way that the speeds are happening and the way that might change something at a certain scale and just Helmholtz and gives free energy yeah. So to be honest, I mean the reason I wrote I write about Helmholtz free energy is just because it's the thing that Geoff Hinton and others used in their when setting up things like the Helmholtz machine that gives free energy I'm just less familiar with it."
"Unknown","00;35;20;07","00;35;40;21","It's, it adds complications that I thought weren't relevant. But if they are relevant, then let's talk about it. Yeah. Could we maybe hear a little bit from you just what is free energy in the sense is that you used it or how would you describe it to somebody who might be not very familiar with thermodynamics? Right. Someone such as me, for example."
"Unknown","00;35;40;28","00;36;07;11","So what I would say is, well, I mean, I'm a philosopher, but so free energy in a physical and a thermodynamic sense, as I understand it, again, welcome. I welcome any things in the other direction. But as I understand it, it's just the energy that's available for doing work in the system. So it's the internal energy, the all the energy that the system harbors just in virtue of its configuration."
"Unknown","00;36;07;18","00;36;55;21","Its sort of existence at that moment, minus all of the energy that's not usable because it's, it's tied up with, with sort of this disorder, with this entropy so I'm sure that someone else here could maybe articulate that more gracefully than I just did. But that's that's the one term and the other term in the equation here is the variation of free energy, which is just the difference between it and the basically the, the, the, the generative model or the, the joint distribution that defines the system's generative model of some kind of statistical model more generally."
"Unknown","00;36;56;05","00;37;33;04","And the approximation to it that you've arrived at at a particular time step. Right. So if you're doing variation inference, you're trying to fit this cue distribution, which I mean, you know, people this has been talked about ad nauseum. So it's hard for me to get the energy to really launch into it because I feel like we all are familiar with this concepts, but it's, it's just the difference between the approximating distribution and the recognition distribution or density and the generative density so so it's so I guess the thing to underline there is that it's, it's only defined in terms of these PS and Qs Q recognition, T generative that are just they're defined in"
"Unknown","00;37;33;04","00;38;01;03","terms of the generative model, which is a model, right? It's a, it's a, it's a um, a mapping between like hypotheses, right? Or hidden states and outcomes. So there's obviously no apriori connection between that and like thermodynamics so I just want to even get at one of these is, is in terms of how it's defined, it's thoroughly like cognitive has to do with belief updating and the other has to do with the physical states of the system."
"Unknown","00;38;02;10","00;38;26;16","And that mapping between the cognitive and the inferential and the physical is again, the entire discussion and the entire point of putting out an artifact that is critique of all or is extendable in the ways that you made it. So Scott, then Steven and then also anyone else who's watching live can just put a live chat in and we'll ask the question."
"Unknown","00;38;26;16","00;38;47;17","So Scott and then Steven. So this is really what a great conversation. Thank you, Ben. Great paper. So couple of things first. First of all, you know, I wonder, we always talk about it being by analogy and it's not really thermodynamics. But Von Neumann said this. Shannon, use the second law of thermodynamics for your quantitative theory of information because in his quote, right?"
"Unknown","00;38;47;17","00;39;03;29","His quote was because the math is identical which tells you something. It at least tells you something about math and humans, but may not tell you anything about the environment, but it tells you something about math and humans. But he also said and if you use the word entropy in any argument, you'll win every time because no one will know what the hell you're talking about."
"Unknown","00;39;05;16","00;39;30;01","So that's good advice on both of those points. Right. So I always look at it and I go, OK, so let's talk about those differentials. And you know, that free energy question that you just answered. I so ideal and policy. I'm not a biologist. I'm a lawyer, OK? And a physics lab. And the reason I'm interested in this stuff is I think you can access the external states."
"Unknown","00;39;30;10","00;39;55;18","And in fact, I think that's all we do as social beings is we that's what rhetoric is. I am constantly trying to last to external states of everyone else. That's what politics is. That's the whole misinformation problem right now. We're setting out. Now in the biological example, we kind of don't send around memos as much. Now, there is there are communications, obviously, in the sciences and in the nature of it."
"Unknown","00;39;55;26","00;40;28;02","But when you get into the human populations, we may have something more going on here. Maybe mind is an emergent phenomenon merely of the attempts at harmonically coupling with other minds, maybe a break if we're successful in tuning into that local mind, we survive. If I am dropped into France and I don't speak French, then am I going to survive?"
"Unknown","00;40;28;03","00;40;49;27","No, now I will. But what it was 300 years ago or whatever, right? So you need to if it's if the mind is sterile and is trained maybe that ability to affect the externality is everything. Maybe that's how we are humans in the way that we are because we're pretty pathetic little organisms on our own, each one of us."
"Unknown","00;40;49;27","00;41;11;17","Right? We don't have sharp fingernails and our tooth and claw is not we get bloody. But it would take a lot of biting because we kind of blunt right? So anyway, that's a bit of a tangent, but so the question is, are we maybe if we look at the maybe we're not entering another brain, maybe the mind is where the action is."
"Unknown","00;41;12;01","00;41;41;15","And when we're doing this in training, maybe we're merely tuning into something that exists already in our in our attempts here at this active inference. And we're just getting on board with the existing mind and so therefore our steady state, our homeostatic state is the one that is most aligned with the externality that's drawing us there. And as lawyers and as policy people, we create artificial externalities."
"Unknown","00;41;41;15","00;42;10;20","That's why I use synthetic intelligence in our title. We're creating synthetic externalities and saying, Hey, come on over here, we got a good externality over here. Check it out. This one's Brazilian sustainable in the SDGs. The UN love it. Right? So creating reality. What do you think about that? In terms of the notion of the efficacy, of the possibility of harmonic coupling with other minds and that as a another active activity and activity, it is not just changing your internal model."
"Unknown","00;42;11;10","00;42;37;16","Yes, it's extremely interesting. So on a I mean, I think this question of how exactly the external states get into the picture is is like pretty fundamental for a lot of people who are in this area. And I think you're right that it's essential, but it's essential in a in a strange way where it's completely inessential to. So like if it's essential and the reason that your steady state is what it is essentially involves the environment right?"
"Unknown","00;42;37;16","00;42;59;06","So like in the free energy principle, the that the ness and an equilibrium steady state is defined with respect to the, you know, a sort of a subsystem that's embedded in an environment and that steady state wouldn't exist without both pieces of that. Right. And it's the fact that you're doing gradient descent on that that guarantees that your variational inferences is going anywhere useful."
"Unknown","00;42;59;27","00;43;23;13","And that's that's sort of the sort of magical seeming connection between actual accuracy and and all of this just churning that happens when you're minimizing free energy over time. But, but the way in which it's inessential is of course, I mean, I just I guess maybe I'm maybe I've been called a Cartesian before. Maybe I am. I don't know."
"Unknown","00;43;23;13","00;43;46;10","I didn't mean to be. But there's a sense in which it's simply just the datum here is just that I can get things wrong. And I don't see that there's any obvious way of limiting the scope of that. Right? So just fallible ism so I think there has to be some subset of states of the overall universe that you identify with you and your perspective and otherwise."
"Unknown","00;43;46;10","00;44;16;20","Right. You have sure that the external states are essential to the story and they they drive the dynamics de facto, but there has to be a difference between the actual external state at any moment and the external state that I represent via my hidden states or my in my internal states. And so I think, you know, like the reason any of this works in practice, in practice is because we have internalized the structure of the external environment."
"Unknown","00;44;16;20","00;44;38;01","And this whole point about harmonic coupling between minds is really cool. It's there's something really cool. And bootstrapping about that it's like right minds are things that harmonize with our minds, right? And I don't just kind of take out another piece of what you said. I the way that I tend to think of this stuff is in terms of sort of imitation."
"Unknown","00;44;38;09","00;45;01;01","So the fundamental term for a lot of people in this area is prediction. But I almost think it's more like we just learned it. Our brains learned to imitate this. The sensory right, the patterns of the processes that produce patterns of sensory input. But the reason it's not just imitation is that also the world is just made up of a bunch of these generative models that each have their own driving right."
"Unknown","00;45;02;28","00;45;29;13","Signals. So, so that I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know how to tie that up in a nice package, but it's a full set of questions and but so so the reason though that I stopped short of saying that the external states are as fundamental in understanding systems, systems, biological systems, people, et cetera, as the internal states is simply things like Cartesian skepticism."
"Unknown","00;45;29;27","00;45;59;09","So we could talk about that well, yeah. Go ahead, Scott. Just to follow up. Well, it is interesting because it's because our struggles in it when, you know, I say on this this group, very often the only time you see reality is when you see paradox, right? If you're seeing absence of paradox, you're intrinsically seeing a model of some sort and so we should embrace a confused state and know that that is a reality."
"Unknown","00;45;59;22","00;46;29;10","And so that is not just a statement for this conversation. But in general, maybe what the mind is doing is the same thing that the body does when it's standing still. You're actually never still. You're always dynamically moving to maintain a semblance of status in a band. It's stillness, right? So maybe we have a band in mind. Maybe it's fully dynamic and maybe what we think of as us, it existential kind of element of it is within a band, right?"
"Unknown","00;46;29;10","00;46;51;26","And people change over time. It's a ship. Theseus in a way, right? It's still the same person. But, you know, some of this stuff has changed out, swapped out over time. So maybe the embodiment helps us with mind as a practical way at any level, because we can say, OK, if we have a system that's doing processing of dynamic environment, some of that processing may be internal."
"Unknown","00;46;51;26","00;47;14;20","So maybe the external, I mean, that's group formation. And, you know, part of it's genetic and consanguinity in terms of performance. And some of it is people who are similarly situated. Right. If you're in a disaster and everyone's all sudden has the same problems, people band together all of a sudden very easily, and the mind morphs into that organism that is needed for that acute situation in that stressful environment."
"Unknown","00;47;15;01","00;47;47;13","And so that maybe it's always dynamic, but that we don't see the dynamics as much and they seem more leisurely when we're studying them in the abstract. But maybe they're highly dynamic in both directions, especially where as we've become information beings and more dependent on symbols, Thanks, Scott. Just one thought on the dynamics is anyone who's recorded a neuron or thought about that knows that just to keep an idea in your mind for a few seconds is being underwritten by vast numbers of dynamical processes that are quite rapid."
"Unknown","00;47;47;29","00;48;26;11","And the second point about the internalizes in the externalities and the internal states and the external states, the Helmholtz Free Energy has this you internal energy. And that's like the configuration of the molecule usually thought of as and then this negative RTS is sort of that those vibratory modes that can't be as easily harnessed but when you pointed to synthetic externalities, which is the same thing as saying reconstructing the internal politics, it's like what if all of a sudden the organization, a system, we could partition it a little bit differently so that we had more you and a little bit less."
"Unknown","00;48;26;14","00;48;50;20","Yes. And when you think about a vibrating molecule, you makes it look like the covalent bonds and Ts is the vibration. But if you think about an ant colony, the movement of the pieces is still part of the internal dynamics. And so especially when we're talking about information which isn't covalently bonded atoms, internal energy is something about the model."
"Unknown","00;48;50;20","00;49;10;26","It's not just about how things are touching and can be broken and reformed. So there's a lot of awesome pieces in what you added there. Steven and then anyone else with the raised hand yeah. I think building on that, you're right. There's this in this. I think you're making the right choice here for this paper using the Helmholtz Free Energy."
"Unknown","00;49;10;27","00;49;38;05","I think that's a even if Gibbs free energies use more inactive inference, that adds an extra level of complication. And I think this is actually useful then because your able to look at some of these distribution questions and just how information is extracted is actually helpful for me to see. You go back to the Helmholtz because it makes me realize, well, that gives free energy, which is more about how action happens."
"Unknown","00;49;38;05","00;50;01;17","How do you know what the internal energy change you would have to do if it was trying to also keep within a certain constraint of volume and pressure, which you don't have to worry about? With Helmholtz free energy that would bring in action, that would bring in the action part of active influence in some ways. But the underlying principles still hold for what you've got."
"Unknown","00;50;01;21","00;50;48;24","You know, so I think that's that's helpful. So I didn't. Have you got any thoughts on that? Yeah, yeah. That is health. I would just I would just say that that is helpful and I would love if if in the future anyone worked on this same topic. And in general, you know, it's unpacked to the sort of I was going to say generalization, but it's maybe the opposite the how this would work out in the case of of action more specifically, and using groups for energy and stuff, they'll be really awesome and taking the temperature of a person in terms of going for a checkup to the doctor and they put the thermometer under your"
"Unknown","00;50;48;24","00;51;10;06","tongue and that's a thermal temperature. And how are you feeling? What does it look like to take the temperature just like Blue had been suggesting? So maybe let's go to the transparent code slide that you added, Alex, because that was definitely something that we were curious about from the zero. And we can just hear your thoughts on this, talk a little bit about this."
"Unknown","00;51;10;06","00;51;31;07","And then also anyone else can just write down a question raise their hand or ask in the live chat, but we'd be really curious to hear what you thought about this. Yeah, sure. So yeah, so the reason that again that I put this in was that Dean and I and maybe, maybe everybody in that point zero discussion had had questions about this."
"Unknown","00;51;31;07","00;52;13;03","And I think the transparent code, it ends up sounding like a slogan that invites, you know, speculation and it's like it's a mystery or something. But this might be a case where I'm trying to say something so simple that it's like it's easy to mess, right? So I'll let me just first frame this. The role that this plays in the paper is that if you want it to be that variation of free energy and homeless free energy in the thermodynamic sense are the same quantity, then you're going to have to explain how well both of them are sort of made up of probabilities, right?"
"Unknown","00;52;13;14","00;52;45;09","So you need to have a mapping from one set of probabilities to the other. So there has to be a way of understanding how the probabilities of states this is a big distinction in the literature, right? How the probabilities of states that represent could represent. So the probabilities of states in the system that the cognitive system that you're analyzing, which is also a physical system, how is it that those could represent the probabilities that are assigned by that system to the external states?"
"Unknown","00;52;47;10","00;53;31;28","So so the idea of a transparent neuronal code or any code is, is just that the probability of, for example, so on the left hand of the diagram here, that if we had a transparent code in the sense in which I'm using that term, then for example, the probability of neuron be firing given that neuron fires, right? So B, is this synaptic neuron and A sends a signal to be or a A fires and certain probability of firing subsequent to a firing that would represent the probability of some state of if there is Q obtaining given that some state of affairs t obtains where a and this we can we can talk about where this"
"Unknown","00;53;31;28","00;54;10;24","mapping comes from. Right. But the assumption is a represents t occurring and B represents Q occurring. So so that's really all I meant by a transparent code. And it's not it's a simple idea, but it's definitely controversial. Right? Like that would mean that if you think that there's a certain conditional probability of, you know, the cat being on the mat, given that the cat lives in the apartment then you're sort of the probability that you would represent those things has to be tied up with the probability that you assign to those things occurring."
"Unknown","00;54;10;24","00;54;35;11","And that's not at all a sort of uncontroversial statement, but it's a simple idea and this is an idea, by the way, again, that's that's used in some of the early connection is literature on it. You mentioned both the machines, right? So there's an early paper on both both machines where this kind of stochastic code is proposed. And the basic one more sentence."
"Unknown","00;54;35;11","00;55;07;26","And this the basic idea is that the objective probability sort of measurable probability of events within the system maps on to the subjective probability that the system assigns to the states of affairs that are represented by those internal states interesting. And in the context of the cognitive system of interest, we're talking about the brain. It's like we know that we're not going to get the transparent coding from the photons hitting the retina to what is the probability of the cat being on the map."
"Unknown","00;55;08;16","00;55;34;24","So with this most high level processing, as you've kind of hinted at with the multiple layers here, it could be possible that at some neuronal stage or at some level of processing there is a pattern that maybe represents the cat being on the map probabilistically, which also invoked the whole representation in questions which we had talked about months ago."
"Unknown","00;55;35;26","00;55;57;04","Right. So it's so fun to see how you delineated where there's controversy sometimes even both sides of the discussion around a controversy. And then it's like, great, here's the artifact. Let's see which way we're going to push it. If there turns out to be more evidence for transparent coding, then we'll push it that way. And if there turns out to be less, then we can push it a different way."
"Unknown","00;55;57;24","00;56;21;05","So, Scott, if you're there, I don't see you yet. So Steven first and then OK, so Scott, go ahead. And then Stephen, I just wanted to mention there was an article in Nature a couple of years ago where there was an assertion made that consciousness this woke up. My consciousness, they asserted, arose 520 million years ago and and I was like, well that's interesting."
"Unknown","00;56;21;05","00;56;46;21","What's the evidence? And what they found was some structures for I think they were proto noto cords or something, but basically it was a ganglia kind of thing, a secondary processing. And their assertion was that because they found physical evidence of a neuronal structure again in fossils, it was some structure that be able to be preserved in shale or something."
"Unknown","00;56;47;01","00;57;14;08","But the that because it was secondary processing beyond the, the, the, the eyeball or the ear for the perceptual apparatus, that secondary processing they suggested meant there was consciousness because that's was their definition. But it was interesting reason I raise it here is it's interesting that notion of embodiment, right? So we're talking again, let's talk about reaction chambers."
"Unknown","00;57;14;08","00;57;44;19","We have there's stimuli all over the world. There's things happening and then we have receptors, the ability to stimuli right in our the afforded to us. And so that comes in. But we don't have the structure of it is TBD. Right. And so then we the the the organism embodies morphologically certain structures over time, eyeballs in nodal cords and ganglia and things like that."
"Unknown","00;57;44;19","00;58;26;08","Right? And those themselves are information structures. They just haven't even embodied in the morphology. So it's morphological computing for a biological organism, right? Because they now can do that thing I can't see in ultraviolet but bees can that kind of thing. Infrared because it's so, it's so I just wanted to raise the idea, that assertion that offended me originally that consciousness arose five and 20 million years ago is not so offensive in a way, because what they're trying to do is grope at the notion of the layering on of morphology and embodiments and say, look, here was a ratchet here, something happened here, and we think we don't know how much more information."
"Unknown","00;58;26;08","00;58;46;18","So Julian James, when he went back and did the origin of consciousness and the evolution of the bicameral mind back in the seventies. Jay any yes. And he was asserting from a literature search that the Wernicke's area flashed on at one point. It was the equivalent of Broca's area language center in the other side of the brain and his literature search."
"Unknown","00;58;46;18","00;59;09;01","He looked at Joan of Arc, he looked at the Iliad, and he said that morphological literature embodied that notion of the mind actually changing ancient literature you can see the mind turning on that internal voice. And so I just wanted to raise that notion. There's embodiments of the external and internal states lying around all over the place. Right."
"Unknown","00;59;09;01","00;59;39;09","And so it's you paper does a nice job of inviting the treatment of those or those as candidates for looking at the mind being assembled, particularly if the mind is external to the brain and the brain is just an antenna tuned into the mind. Think 11 funny little synchronicity there is that Julian Jaynes wrote the book that Scott mentioned Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind."
"Unknown","00;59;39;17","01;00;18;26","But Edwin Jaynes was a very famous thermodynamics researcher who introduced the maximum entropy interpretation of thermodynamics. So related like we all are, were they related? Were they related by the blood aren't we all? Yeah. Well, come on, Stephen. And then anyone else yeah. Just sort of coming to this diagram that you've got here. So I think one thing I'll be interested in and as you say, neuronal or other internal systemic state, so you sort of give a little bit of latitude to dynamic."
"Unknown","01;00;18;26","01;01;02;29","All aspects of that goes to cognitive state of the system beliefs and I'm wondering how much your tie to those beliefs being statistical, computational, sort of separate things or how much is it beliefs on action policies? I mean, I'm not I'm pushing active in from the beginning, but that's know it's fun. Yeah. What's your thoughts on that? Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of questions here about how we individually representations and such but I wouldn't think I don't even I don't really think of these as detachable separate entities at all so that nobody's labeled P but I'm one of these functionalist who thinks that the reason that the label itself does nothing right, the reason"
"Unknown","01;01;03;15","01;01;28;00","the label is a useful indicator for people outside the system to understand what it represents. But the representational function is just the role that that node plays in the network. So and that would, I think that it subsumes and includes connections to action. Right? I just tend to think of connections to action as the special case where what you're generating, what your generative model is generating are states of the motor effectors."
"Unknown","01;01;28;18","01;02;02;20","So I just and I think any, any kind of planning that, that, that the organism wants to do can also be understood as learning sort of sensory motor contingencies, which will influence how states of the motor effectors are generated in tandem with states of the perceptual system. Right. How perceptual biases occur? So basically, yeah, I don't think that, that there's any like these don't need to be cognitive separable features of it, these don't need to be several features of the system."
"Unknown","01;02;02;20","01;02;27;08","They're just like when I say that a state represents key because it represents for me has sort of a functionalist meaning I just mean that's just sort of a label for a set of ways in which the system can behave because of its internal structure. So including sort of internal dynamics. Right, but it's really just a label for a property of the dynamics of the system."
"Unknown","01;02;28;13","01;03;00;03","Cool. And also beyond the action being at the gross organismal motor level, potentially internal representations or states could be like hormonal or neurocircuitry. So the neurons fire, but neurons have other affordances like the little micro motor behavior with the motor proteins like releasing a vesicle of of a protein that's been transcribed and translated. Also tiny little motor behaviors of nested smaller agents inside of that neuron interface."
"Unknown","01;03;00;18","01;03;40;22","So Stephen and then anyone else with the resistance, actually just what you were saying there, Daniel, does that mean that you can almost release hormones through the brain? It doesn't have to be like through a gland in the body, but you've got smaller scale releases, neuro secretary cells and neuroendocrine biology are large areas. So yes, many kinds of cells pull in and secrete molecules and neurons are of various subtypes, secreting specific hormones, neuropeptides, all kinds of hormones and signaling molecules short range and into the circulation going."
"Unknown","01;03;40;22","01;04;26;25","Yeah, OK, thanks and, and I'll let that process and that's really useful. I didn't know about that. And I suppose just adding on into this, you when you mentioned about sensory motor contingencies and being able to I'm so wondering that the scale of consciousness, you know, and things entered into consciousness, the phenomenon logical sort of awareness, do you sense that there may be even if active influences on the right in it or some other types of like it doesn't have to be as pure active inference at that scale and it could be working with other types of sort of architectures or process architectures."
"Unknown","01;04;28;08","01;04;50;18","I mean. Well, one thing is that consciousness. So I think that brought up consciousness for the first time. Here. That's really interesting. I, I sort of deliberately didn't say anything about it in the day because I find that it's, it's a very thorny topic for me. Of course, for many people it's not, it's not notoriously not an easy problem or maybe it is and it looks like our problem."
"Unknown","01;04;50;18","01;05;15;29","But anyway, yeah, so, so I'm not sure I do think that all of the cognitive dynamics I'm talking about are probably more fine grained than what shows up in consciousness. So I wouldn't say that there's some transparent mapping from whatever you believe in the sense of belief. It's implicitly defined here and what you are consciously aware of. I so we can do all sorts of theories of how consciousness relates to this stuff."
"Unknown","01;05;18;11","01;05;34;09","There was a second piece to what you said that I wanted to address, but I don't remember what it was. What is this scale? I think you kind of addressed it a little bit. There so again, you you're going to say, yeah, we'll come back to it if you remember what it was. Yeah. Scott And then anyone else with the raised tent?"
"Unknown","01;05;34;24","01;05;56;01","Yeah. I wanted to go back to the notion of neurotransmitters from a minute ago when you were talking about endocrine neural function. Couple of things. There's a couple of books here, just one. The hold up is cognitive cognition, archeological the cognitive archeology and human evolution. Kind of an interesting notion there. Couple of others there. Other one, archeology in memory, kind of an interesting one."
"Unknown","01;05;56;14","01;06;14;15","The reason I raise these is kind of interesting in toggling neurotransmitters. I remember reading an article a few years ago that suggested that among all the animals in the animal kingdom, the animal kingdom is an old representation. Carol, this Linnaeus thing, I get it. But in any event, there's only one animal that doesn't share any of the neurotransmitters."
"Unknown","01;06;14;15","01;06;33;11","The rest of the animals, like the box jellyfish or some kind of jellyfish, I forget which one it was. And I thought that was interesting. Just what we were just talking about a minute ago, Daniel was noting about neurotransmitters. Well, again, it's morphological computing those are artifacts of earlier solutions, the practices of processing of information by these organisms."
"Unknown","01;06;33;11","01;07;00;08","Right. And so the fact that we can go back and say, wow, I wonder if these things were related, given the fact that they don't share any neurotransmitters, that's kind of in a serial element. It's not something that you get like bones and, you know, it doesn't fossilize well. But isn't it interesting that we can find the morphology of neurotransmission in current organisms and use that to understand lineage and relationship?"
"Unknown","01;07;00;23","01;07;41;23","So, in fact, that's a morphological artifact and it's not epigenetic. Right. But it's interesting, the relationship of the the the homeostatic state of of thinking. It's cognition of a certain line of organisms and the morphology of its neurotransmitters. I'm interested in you. Social insects, for instance, did people do profiles if anybody here knows anything about you, social insects please type in the do they what's the story with neurotransmitter analysis among you?"
"Unknown","01;07;41;23","01;08;08;17","Social insects is that especially neurotransmitters especially invoked and is the more followed you neurotransmitters perhaps where the organism resides more than other physicalities. That's great. Great question, Scott. So first on the Tina four point and then the use social so the of for indeed it did suggest new evolutionary hypotheses when people investigated which neurotransmitters Tina force used and they convergent."
"Unknown","01;08;08;17","01;08;49;20","We utilize some of the same simple charged amino acid derivatives but they use them in different ways for example, glutamate is not used in muscle contraction in vertebrates. We have acetyl cholinergic receptors at the muscle, but glutamate was used, which supports Alex's point about functional representation. There's nothing that says glutamate means muscle contraction. It's a functional context with a receptor and the muscle cell in a neuron that generates the contraction and potentially for a later day, maybe when we discuss active inference, the paper, but we've done multiple studies measuring neurotransmitter metabolism and gene expression in ants."
"Unknown","01;08;50;01","01;09;17;05","And there's been a lot of work on honeybees as well. And just the one point I'll make here, since it is a large area and people can look at the papers if they want, is that the neurotransmitters that are involved in the regulation of foraging in ants and bees are inherited from the neurotransmitters that regulate foraging. And solitary insects like dopamine in October mean in fruit flies where it's been investigated in the context of solitary foraging."
"Unknown","01;09;17;24","01;09;44;17","But the inputs and the outputs of foraging for the social insects are different. So whereas an inter, a drosophila, it's like internal hunger signals, representations, maybe some sort of neural hormonal encoding leads to foraging behavior and then that results in the acquisition of food that reenters that bodily system. But an ant forager is foraging essentially food for the larva, a different part of the colony organism."
"Unknown","01;09;45;03","01;10;08;11","So the inputs like the stimuli that lead to induce foraging behavior and the outputs like where the food goes are different, but the foraging motor behavior is conserved. And it's that rewiring of the motor motif of foraging via the same neurotransmitter octopi mean a dopamine in others that actually enable the colony lifecycle. So it's a really awesome area."
"Unknown","01;10;08;11","01;10;45;15","I hope we can talk more about how that relates to active inference so Steven and then Scott and then anyone else who raises their hands yeah. I'd like to ask a question about this. So links to that is a kind of a semi theory I've got, but is it feasible with this that the brain like an organism, basically the cells that become the brain, effectively they mutate and they transform into the unique form that the, the brain and the nervous system basically like another organism growing into the main organism, right?"
"Unknown","01;10;45;15","01;11;16;25","So you've got two organisms once they differentiate and the brain is like the control and the nervous system is like the control organization growing into and with the other the fascia of the other organism, one in a human face fascia. But obviously I just wondered if that would be plausible and that would do anything with this brain organism boundary question that I know you are kind of connected to in terms of wanting to maybe maintain more of that potential identity."
"Unknown","01;11;16;25","01;11;45;03","That's something that other people have talked about or whether it's a little bit out there and just yeah, biologically or from the sort of cognitive philosophical sense, how that pans out yeah. Yeah. I love the like biology and biochemistry and stuff and all this, you know, wonderful fine grained scientific life sciences stuff you guys are bringing to the table on this."
"Unknown","01;11;45;16","01;12;14;10","That's that's not as much where I'm coming from, but I think it's really, really cool. But so, so the idea that you just articulated sounds, sounds out there and plausible to me. So I think that that's kind of what I would expect is that the same story can be told on multiple scales internal to the system. Right. And so the brain learning, sort of learning, growing I guess I've just been conditioned to think of all this as one type of process, right?"
"Unknown","01;12;14;10","01;12;39;29","So I said learning, but morphological development and, and growing into it's into its mature shape is a form of learning. But so anyway, that happening and interfacing with the rest of the organism, I mean, I definitely don't see any reason that we need to draw a like joint joint the nature around the physically right the organism that we can perceive there are going to be many similar joints that we could delineate within."
"Unknown","01;12;40;21","01;13;09;07","So I think that's a cool idea. I don't know much about the details of that process, so I can't check that validate it, but it sounds plausible Thanks, Alex Blue and then Scott so just to kind of maybe ask Stephen to unpack a little bit what he said. So I think in terms of like a brain organism, like separation or duality, like a do you maybe mean like mind the organism?"
"Unknown","01;13;09;07","01;13;34;04","Because as like in my experience, it's like the it's like the brain is like the control center, right? Like I don't know that there's necessarily like a division between the brain and the and the organism, but definitely like the mind is kind of like the theory of concepts. So maybe could you just unpack that a little bit? Well, I was actually thinking partly thinking about the work of Mike Levine and Mike Levine and Mike Levin."
"Unknown","01;13;34;04","01;14;05;26","And I was so in a way, I my understanding is that once a cell becomes a neuronal cell, there's no going back like it's kind of like it. So it's in some ways it's, it's, it's I was curious whether that whole structure be it from a small organism, is effectively like we basically have two organisms in our body because our cell is differentiated into the bodily organisms and the neuronal ones."
"Unknown","01;14;06;05","01;14;33;25","And they sort of they, they work together in this symbiotic kind of cybernetic loop so that that's the kind of thinking about how it pans out, you know, so I just if I could just like speak to that a little bit. So the neurons can differentiate and do in like especially like a neural cancer types. So we do see some some differentiation there."
"Unknown","01;14;33;25","01;15;04;01","It's not as committal as we've thought before. I mean, it's kind of a budding field and the the, you know, anti way of thinking is that there is it's a set lineage, but there's there's ways that you can convince them to do otherwise. I think Mike Levin's thing is the bio electric field right. And so so he separates the bio electricity of the organism as as maybe the overarching control center there."
"Unknown","01;15;04;01","01;15;49;26","But I've not seen like a neural like a neuron body distinction. That's why I was just like, what? Sorry. Well, one thought on that and also to Scott's point about the emergence of a second level of the nervous system is to remember from developmental biology that ectoderm the outer layer of the developing embryo turns into neural ectoderm, which is the tissue that gives rise to the nervous system and gastric lation in the neural tube so the nervous system developmentally, neurons share an affinity and a developmental proximity to the external layer and so when you start nesting internal layers inside of that tube that's closed, you start getting higher order nervous systems."
"Unknown","01;15;50;10","01;16;19;14","And then also the pituitary gland to sort of close this with neuroendocrine discussion. The pituitary gland is actually amalgamated from multiple developmental sources. And so it's interesting that it has such a pivotal hormonal position integrating hormones and the brain's function and itself is like a re fusion from a tissue perspective of multiple branches of the ectoderm that had branched."
"Unknown","01;16;19;14","01;16;42;25","And then they reformulate a new organ which is the pituitary gland that serves a very coordinating role in organismal development. So Scott, and then anyone else with the question you know, this is the best way I can spend my day with people who say the quote, the pituitary gland is amalgamated from multiple ectoderm sources. I'm in the right place, man."
"Unknown","01;16;42;27","01;17;10;05","You know, when you, you know, this is the place for me, I can tell you that. Hey, couple of things. Let's go back to this part in whole and dynamic in cancer as an organism stuff for a second. This is this is good stuff. So, you know, the cancer analysis where they start to treat cancer is an organism in an ecosystem is some of the framings, to think of it that way, a recruitment of a kind of chaotic kind of like having a drunk uncle stay at your house is one way of looking at cancer, right?"
"Unknown","01;17;10;05","01;17;32;26","Is a it's a chaotic use of resources. So that is kind of interesting, right? Because so we're talking and going back to Stephen's point about the mind being different so I'm thinking of some Biogenesis here, Lynn Margulis stuff and the chloroplasts in all plant cells in the mitochondria and all animal cells were once their artifacts have once preexisting bacteria."
"Unknown","01;17;32;26","01;18;00;24","Right. They migrated on board with eukaryotes because it was a better deal, more leverage, more de-risking, higher levels of engagement with the outside. Right. They change your internal physicality and morphology so they can think at way higher levels. They could access way more complex levels of engagement than a single celled organism, including the engagements they could get through sexual reproduction, which introduced additional symbolic novelty so they could be more dynamically engaged with environments."
"Unknown","01;18;00;24","01;18;34;28","Right. Clonal reproduction does not introduce a lot of novelty, so it's hard to keep up with dynamic environments. And this is something like intelligent design but it's not. So it's interesting, Stephen, in your notion of the mind being separate, because in a way the mind is formed by the social environment. You know, I've told the story before. My sister adopting a five month old Chinese child who is now 22, is raised in central Pennsylvania, speak Spanish and English, does not speak Chinese, does not like Chinese food, does not like Chinese music, and basically looks like a Chinese person, but is not."
"Unknown","01;18;35;12","01;18;55;13","So is that mind a Chinese mind? The problem is we don't yet have any control groups on the mind formation. Right. Once you formed, you are who you are and we say, OK, that's it. But I like Stephen where you're going on that notion maybe the mind is an independent quantity. And again, the brain is an antenna to the mind."
"Unknown","01;18;55;13","01;19;24;06","So maybe the body contains the antenna components again, I don't mean the real intended, but sort of and it needs to be tuned. It's Farrall. And so maybe what's happening is the tuning actually creates a mind. Maybe the mind is not resident in the brain in a child. And maybe Bayesian inferences construct a mind set and to maybe directed to Alex."
"Unknown","01;19;24;13","01;19;57;05","Before we go to Stephen's question, Dean, you really focused on this sentence. It may be, for example, that biological systems run an algorithm closer to contrastive divergence than to simulated annealing so what does that mean or what what does that reflect on? Can I maybe give a little extra info on that? Just addressed a quick, quick thing. I want I want to hear Stephen and I want to hear everybody else, but I have a question in the back."
"Unknown","01;19;57;07","01;20;14;28","Sorry, I have to say this in the background, I've got people taking the front of my house, so I haven't been able to do much other than try to control my A.D.D. But I have a big question for Alex once we get through the the part that Stephen and Scott want to have addressed, and it's specifically to what you just raised."
"Unknown","01;20;15;08","01;20;54;04","So thank you. Great. Let's go to Stephen and then we'll return to Dean and the contrast of divergence. Yeah. Maybe this will bring this together is, I suppose, what I'm just proposing is, is that there is some structural biological differentiation which is will have an impact in some ways and how we think about extended cognition. But if we I very much of the mind body environment dynamic system kind of idea."
"Unknown","01;20;54;15","01;21;31;00","So I suppose I'm talking about there being a difference biologically, but probably at the macro level, I'm, I'm trying any way to formulate approaches which talk about a whole system and not anything else than that. But I recognize that it may open up some other cans of worms, but I know that how I wonder if that's something that you're there's this, there's this annealing relates to the mind body environment dynamic in playing out within that or is is it a little bit more separate or different to that?"
"Unknown","01;21;31;21","01;22;03;13","Yeah. I mean the the use I was making of this contrast between contrast the divergence and so anyway, kneeling here is was just was kind of more specific I was just thinking of so annealing this process of gradually lowering the temperature and simulated annealing was an optimization technique that mirrors that process. And so I mean, I guess the answer to your question, Stephen, is I wasn't really thinking about system environment relations here at all."
"Unknown","01;22;03;13","01;22;28;16","I was just thinking of two different sort of internal processes and how that how they might be mapped onto onto this is learning algorithms and processes and physics. But so, so I mean, I can wait to go on to that to take Dean's question or. Yeah. Or what I maybe. Yeah, let's let's go for the divergence. Yeah, I I'm not predictable."
"Unknown","01;22;29;10","01;22;53;16","Bring it up, pull up the paper because I need to explain this. So, Alex, in the paper, you, you, you talked in the subsection one to the role of internal energy and we just find it here. You talked about the inverse relationship between probability and energy is exploded and which uses of energy as a cost function and optimization problems."
"Unknown","01;22;53;16","01;23;16;17","So you made that clear. And then a little further down in the paper, you talked about contrast of divergence, which in equilibrium distribution have a restrictive Boltzmann machine. And then you got into a little bit more about the comparison to the simulated annealing. And then you got into Section two and I'm just going to try to find it here, the ensemble piece."
"Unknown","01;23;16;17","01;24;11;04","So here's my here's my question. If I were to bring a if I were to bring three things and cast the widest, largest first and blanket yet around your paper, because I think that's what your paper does. If I were to bring a Polaroid picture, a sprinkler and an astronaut together. So if I were to bring identity, which is where that was the primary attractor of your paper to me, identity astronaut, that that distribution piece and the first one, the the the Polaroid, the Isomorphism, could you explain how you brought these things that are so seemingly distill into some sort of a coherence?"
"Unknown","01;24;11;15","01;24;31;19","How how did when you were sitting because I know you did this on a very proximal level, but it it has far reaching implications based on the kinds of questions that Stephen has asked, the ones that Scott asked, the points that Lou and Daniel had made, it doesn't just seem to be local. It seems to be really distributed as well."
"Unknown","01;24;32;02","01;25;03;25","And so I'm just really curious you wrote the paper, but now that you've kind of been able to step back from it and sort of take it in in a perspective that distance must have you really, really looking at this maybe in interesting ways because there isn't just the stuff on the paper. There's the stuff now that you've kind of reflected on and seen the inversion and, and wondered, holy mackerel, that I opened up a can of worms or what did I, what have I done?"
"Unknown","01;25;03;25","01;25;32;11","I'm just I'm curious about that on a personal level. Right well, just I mean, in general, my the most striking thing about how this has played out is that people are really interested. So we mentioned this in the discussion and I had emails about it too, are really interested in the distinction between genuine minds and like simulations which was completely an afterthought when I wrote this."
"Unknown","01;25;32;11","01;25;53;20","It was just like, Oh yeah, I better deal with the scope of this. And so I should put a sense about that. And I did put care into it. You know, I put the best sentence I could and it wasn't my focus, but yeah, I mean, the the thing, I guess the thing that that strikes me about this."
"Unknown","01;25;53;20","01;26;16;16","So it was it was right. I mean, it was intended to be this. It was, it was intended to be a very fundamental thesis that I'm considering here. So I do think it has far reaching implications. I have no idea whether it's true, but if it did, it would have these far reaching implications I guess what I'm but I'm less clear on is I'm still I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop."
"Unknown","01;26;16;16","01;26;44;27","I'm waiting for someone to say, here's an example of a biological system in which there's no way that you can map the cognitive interpretation directly to the physical interpretation. Because if that's the case and if I think of it as a compelling example, then then I guess I'm wrong so far. So far that hasn't happened. There have been some interesting suggestions, but so so I guess I'm I don't know if I'm directly answering your question or I'm just to me that the devil is still very much in the details."
"Unknown","01;26;44;27","01;27;05;22","And this is essentially a defense of a I was trying to I was trying to show that maybe some some apriori prima facie objections to this kind of thesis were not you know, we're not compelling, but there could be all sorts of details that emerge that that that might question it."
"Unknown","01;27;09;03","01;27;25;26","So I don't know if that really answers your question. I'm sorry. No, no. And again, it was kind of like when I was talking with Blue and and Daniel in the point and I I brought up so I talked to people who were very much in an activist camp and, you know, they want it they want to see that realistic."
"Unknown","01;27;25;26","01;27;50;06","And then there's the statistical camp, and they really want to have that sort of top down, where's the channel? What's going on? And I just kind of thought what your paper did is it broken both of those perspectives? I don't know that they even have to necessarily merger overlap. I think the fact that we can we can use both and see both, it's just a really interesting thing."
"Unknown","01;27;50;06","01;28;12;15","Now, I don't know whether that is just provable or it should be. I guess that would mean that and activism is not a thing or you statistical modeling is not a thing and yet we use these things. So I mean, I guess they can be discounted but I don't know that they'll go away. That's all I saw. I guess I you have answered my question."
"Unknown","01;28;12;15","01;28;44;15","We can leave things open and and not necessarily have them provide everything. But but we can't just sort of discount something and throw it away until somebody, as you said, comes along and says no. Right. It doesn't work. Yeah. And just one quick follow up. And this this the one reason I wrote this paper is that I think that what a lot of people find compelling about the free energy principle and the literature around that is the idea that there might be a link between physics and cognition."
"Unknown","01;28;44;15","01;29;27;28","Right. That there is a fundamental theory kind of emerging. But it's I think it's very hard to pin down what the precise relationship, but it's hard for different people at different times. It's becoming it's it's becoming clearer. This has been worked out a little bit in the free energy principle literature, but like it's difficult to articulate exactly what the the the deep connection is between, you know, variational inference on the one hand and, and like the behavior of physical systems so I just wanted to, you know, I wanted to throw out here's one version, one possibility of what the supposed to be a clean, precise, brief statement of what that relationship could be."
"Unknown","01;29;29;04","01;29;53;04","So that, you know yeah. It's open ended but so that it can be, you know, falsified just those two other other interpretations of that relation, cetera, thanks, Alex. We'll go to blue and then if anyone in the chat or if Dave have has a comment, then feel free. But first, blue so Alex, I think that this goes back to what you were saying in the very beginning about scale, right?"
"Unknown","01;29;53;06","01;30;20;10","So it's it's hard right now even to map like cognition onto like neural activation. I mean, I mean, right now we don't know too much like too many components in the system are are murky for it to really be clear what's happening. And I think, you know, as we talk about information going from a cell, you know, to from a brain to a neuron to cognition to action to bodily regulation and these kinds of things we don't really know."
"Unknown","01;30;20;12","01;30;54;26","Is information compressed, is it integrated? Like what is happening to scale a system up or down? Right. I think that that's a hard problem. Yeah. I mean, maybe I'm not sure what you mean by scaling the system up or down well, in this section, you talk about the scale free nature of free energy dynamics and about how global and local free energy minimization could be understood as subsystems that are undergoing some sort of akin process at their own skills."
"Unknown","01;30;55;15","01;30;55;24","Right."
"Unknown","01;30;58;28","01;31;26;22","Yeah. So I mean, the thing that so I mean, the thing that I want to react to then what you said was the the idea that we don't really know what's going on in the brain still. It's very murky. I mean, I think that's true. It's always relative, right? To some idea of how much we could know. But I mean, what got me into this whole literature in the first place was, was I was starting again, starting with the machine learning literature around 20, 12, 20, 13."
"Unknown","01;31;27;08","01;31;54;29","I started to feel like we actually were getting a grasp on on some of these principles and how this works quite generally. So like like the Helmholtz machine, for example, that you talked about that in the point zero I think that's a model. Now, if the model is accurate, then it seems like what's happening is as we, you know, as signals are sent from one neuron population, to another, further from the sensory motor periphery, the information is being compressed."
"Unknown","01;31;55;00","01;32;35;24","Right? So that's a particular hypothesis that there's successive compression of information, meaning that things are represented using, you know, lower dimensional, well doctor spaces. If you want to translate between vector spaces and neuronal populations. Right. And and that we have a pretty good idea, right? Like this this sort of architecture explains so many things. I mean, that's this is this is what got people so excited about the predictive brain or the Bayesian brain type hypotheses is that there is so many different things from different domains in psychology and neuroscience that this seems to this kind of perspective seems to unify."
"Unknown","01;32;37;16","01;32;57;16","You know, it's it's it's to be expected in a sort of Helmholtz and architecture that like, you know, the you can always sort of endogenous indigenously cause the same sorts of states that you could be in as a result of perception. Right. And that imagination and the internal generation of states has a particular role to play in learning and things like this."
"Unknown","01;32;57;24","01;33;32;14","So I'm kind of rambling, but my, my, my sense is that this, this sort of Bayesian compulsion, revolution, whatever you want to call it in recent years, has has shown that we we do understand many principles in how the brain functions at the level of like at the human scale. If the question is about like how to how how other scales fall into this, I mean, there's some work that's maxillary Armstead and Caspir has been people like that have done on on understanding their own population dynamics in terms of active inference at that scale."
"Unknown","01;33;32;18","01;33;57;29","And so that's really interesting so like what I would think of as a structural like a structural representation from the point of view of me or you like a human being, you can also think of as a process of neurons performing active inference right at their own scale. But I think there's to me the hard question there is how do you relate the contents of the representation at the higher scale to the contents of the lower scale?"
"Unknown","01;33;58;23","01;34;20;10","That's, that's the thing that bothers me in this area. Yeah. Just if I could just respond really quick. Yeah, that's exactly the thing. I mean, we can see how this active in France is happening at different scales for sure. But how scaling up and scaling down or the the translation from one scale to another happens is very mysterious still."
"Unknown","01;34;21;03","01;34;46;12","Yeah, totally cool. So we have about 20 minutes left, so if anyone has a question in the live chat, otherwise we'll go to Scott and then Steven and be preparing our thoughts for what to continue discussing. And point two so Scott so picking up on the last couple of points, really interesting the I was thinking of it what was the gentleman's name who Barrett's in who said informations the difference that makes a difference."
"Unknown","01;34;46;12","01;35;23;07","What was that guy's name? Is it anyway the difference it makes a difference. And I always thought the first difference that he's talking about is the very perceptual perceptual change in the environment. And the second difference is is that perceptual change relevant to you. And so I want to unpack that a little bit here because content's one of the things that I was talking about my MIT presentation and one of the things I noticed is Shannon tells us signal versus noise but I think but it doesn't tell us if the signal is a cancer cure or a chocolate chip cookie recipe."
"Unknown","01;35;24;06","01;35;46;21","Right. And so the content is left and defined there. Now, what if so? So I define living systems as auto catalytic entropy secreting structures. Notice, I don't say they have to be embodied in any particular embodiment. My son said the only reason I came up with the definition is I wanted to use the word secretion because it was juicing."
"Unknown","01;35;48;12","01;36;19;17","But he is right in part. I wanted to make it juicy. But the reason I raised that here is when you look at the very senior or whoever was is Berenson. Anyway, the difference it makes the difference info information really. Maybe is what we cognitive beings call relevant differentials that we perceive. Irrelevant differentials are just noise and so the difference that makes a difference, we call it information, but there's a lot of differentials out there in the world."
"Unknown","01;36;20;08","01;36;42;02","And that's the reason I'm going there is since we're talking to a philosopher today and what I deal in as a lawyer is rhetoric and rhetoric is what you do to bring together incommensurable, right? And rhetoric is not like crazy glue. It's like it's like a proxy. It doesn't just bring things together. It also brings them together and fills gaps."
"Unknown","01;36;43;06","01;37;23;26","So the rhetoric of information is our storytelling about relevant differentials. And we seek to sculpt our internal model and then train other people's internal models. Because when we train other people's internal models with our rhetoric, then it risks our externality because other people's internal models are my externality, right? So the rhetoric is the tool that we use to reduce differentials or to increase relevance alignment among cognitive systems running cognition."
"Unknown","01;37;24;16","01;37;49;15","How's that? I wanted to try to integrate it. That seemed to me that last couple of comments, it felt like maybe information is an of when we put too much in seeking information, maybe information, the difference that makes a difference after the fact. We can tell that because before the fact we can't tell what's relevant for instance, suntan lotion never existed because we didn't know that photons cause skin cancer."
"Unknown","01;37;49;26","01;38;14;07","Now there's an entire commercial factories and areas in the grocery store that sells suntan lotion. It doesn't mean that the sun became carcinogenic. We just learned that it did. So the inference the we were able to make that inference at large scales and now influence buying behavior which leverages de-risk future behaviors, which is the reason that we care about information."
"Unknown","01;38;14;07","01;38;43;03","That's the difference that makes a difference anyway. But the last couple of things, that's, that's really cool stuff. I mean, I really see things similarly, I think on a lot of fronts there I think so that the question of accountability, like you're kind of saying like we don't have to be too fixated on this term information because it really it means differences that make a difference are being aware of differentials."
"Unknown","01;38;43;03","01;39;04;00","So I mean, I I agree with that. I think I mean, I again, I always go back to just the the the sort of bedrock stuff. So like I think I think Shannon's interpretation of information was actually a little bit unnecessarily epistemic. I think it could have been just stuck sarcastic. So he says, you know, it's coming to know something."
"Unknown","01;39;04;06","01;39;29;14","It's like, well, but we could generalize that and just talk about what one comes to believe. And then I think if we have to work with that notion, which isn't information anymore, as Shannon defined it because he talked about knowledge but whatever that generalization of information is called, I think that would really that's that logic thinks yeah. So so that's that's all that I think we're getting at with the kinds of information."
"Unknown","01;39;29;14","01;40;00;04","But what what I think gets really interesting and difficult philosophically is, OK, so obviously there's, there's self information, right? So there's just like something things my retina and or something downstream from that and I notice a little blip in my visual field. Right? And that's something I'm aware of. So that's information about itself anyway. But then know that more important signals carry all sorts of information about other things, meaning they I guess they need us to predict and expect other differences beyond themselves."
"Unknown","01;40;00;18","01;40;25;26","And so and so the tricky thing to me is, OK, so I take myself to be the system of interacting parts neurons and also other things obviously that sort of embodies a perspective and the information that a signal carries depends on that whole system and how the signal impacts it. Right. And and, you know, one of my neurons is an entirely different type of system."
"Unknown","01;40;27;09","01;40;59;22","My daughter has to tell me something. What's up? You got a stream awesome. Sorry. Well, yeah. Oh, sorry. No, that's your that's awesome. Yeah. So your generative models on a livestream right now. I'm sorry, but that's cool. Yeah. I don't know. So I was saying something about neurons and then announcing those stream basically. Yeah. So, so the like that."
"Unknown","01;41;00;05","01;41;16;24","The question for me is, so like, I think of content or the information content of a signal for a person as relative to the person to the system. And so if you've got a completely different system with a different structure, I think you can sort of compare the structures of the systems to see how similar the content is."
"Unknown","01;41;16;25","01;41;41;19","Right. But I think it has to be at that whole level of the sort of holistic entire system level that you need to make these content comparisons so I don't remember whether that directly links back to where we started this, but nice. Yeah. One, one quick thought on that is the difference that makes a difference, which is also a big key term in the philosophy of biology."
"Unknown","01;41;41;25","01;42;17;07","Like the mutation is the difference that makes a difference for something inactive inference. It's the difference in observation that makes a difference for either the generative model updating that's inference or the difference that makes a difference for action. So we have a way to talk about it. And then also the DOCS artistic note not my total area, but it looks like this is how we can work towards pluralism across perspectives because if it's framed as one person believes that it's hot and one person believes that it's cold, if there's only one truth and we're going to play tug of war, then we have to fight."
"Unknown","01;42;17;22","01;42;35;21","But if it's true that one person believes it's hot and it's true that one person believes it's cold, there's no problem, there's still might be differences on what temperature the people want the room. But by framing things about what a perspective or a system or an agent believes to be true or just beliefs, period could be an ironic belief."
"Unknown","01;42;36;04","01;43;32;16","All of a sudden we can interact with multi-agent systems and deal with them in a way that still has local logic. So Stephen and then anyone else so thanks just so close out. I suppose in a way I'd be curious how this this work with beliefs that has a nice as, as then you said it bridges action orientated approaches and pragmatic approaches with more epistemic approaches because beliefs tend to be beliefs about what will happen when something is done in the world often not necessarily and I'm curious how this paper and this kind of underpinning relates or helped to inform where you were going with a new paper that was intriguing about the folk psychology"
"Unknown","01;43;32;16","01;43;56;23","and how maybe that that there's some sort of that's where one of the bridges out from this paper into, you know, folk psychology being how we kind of intuitively believe the world is based on our experience is. So there is a certain element of like whether that's how it's structured in the brain, it's kind of how we might structure it before science tells us something else."
"Unknown","01;43;57;04","01;44;24;29","And in a certainly socio cultural sense, I'd be interested in how that extension plays out with this paper. Yeah. So, so there's definitely a direct connection between this paper and that one. I mean, I wanted to write a sort of sequel to this paper where I talked about specifically desires and how those the sort of the way those would be grounded through thermodynamics according to this picture, or co native states in general, like the states with a world to mind direction of that."
"Unknown","01;44;26;12","01;44;57;19","And so then I started talking to Tyrone Smith and others about this and we ended up, you know, coauthoring a quite different paper that has some commonality. But I still want to write and I still want to write one that's more on the thermodynamics side of things. But the connection is in this, you know, the sort of identity thesis that at the end of this paper, I argue for it by way of David Lewis, who, who one of the terms in the identity is the implicit definition that folk psychology gives us of mental states."
"Unknown","01;44;59;04","01;45;28;01","So we haven't really gotten into that. Maybe we will next week or something. I don't know. There's Ramsay sentences I'd love to talk about the we got we got the Ramsay sentences, we got the sleep wake simulation. Yeah. All other topics that we will really look forward to exploring. Yeah, let's please get into that. But like basically, I mean, I don't know if as usual, I feel I always feel like I'm not doing an adequate job of answering questions."
"Unknown","01;45;28;01","01;45;56;14","I'm sorry, but by folks psychology in this context, I'm really thinking of just our it's sort of like theory of mind, right? It's like our implicit theory of the way people, including ourselves, function. So I think that that's essential, even though it's not until the end that's essential to what I'm doing this paper. Because if you don't have mental states to define, then you don't have any identity relation because that's one of the terms in the identity relation."
"Unknown","01;45;56;25","01;46;18;04","Although you could also, I guess maybe if you're doing pure Bayesian modeling, you could just write down a bunch of states and equations for how they update without thinking about folk psychology at all. But but I guess the point of this is that if one of the terms in isolation is the mind. Well, I think folk psychology, I don't actually love that term."
"Unknown","01;46;18;04","01;46;45;01","I mean, it's OK, it's just the philosophers term of art, right? I just mean in intuitive human psychology I think is one of the terms in this relation. Cool scientists are folk too. So cognitive diversity means that we have all different ways of knowing and there may not be one default or simply intuitive way of working or knowing because what's intuitive to one person will be out of the groove for somebody else."
"Unknown","01;46;45;11","01;47;12;27","And that's why the movement towards pluralism in terms of our understanding of ideas and of ecosystems is so interesting to talk about and see connected to active inference. Any thoughts or what would be something that somebody is excited from the conversation today or thinking about how we could resolve or at least introduce again next week? I think a few of the things we have written down is the sleep wake simulation."
"Unknown","01;47;12;27","01;47;50;11","What is our agent doing? What does it do in terms of your model? We have the RAMSI sentences and where does that style of logical representation come into play? We have empirical validity. What kind of experiments are you interested in? Or curious about? What else could be interesting we could still talk about that. The contrast of divergence versus simulated, the kneeling thing I just really briefly wanted to follow up and say, I think when I say intuitive psychology, I mean, I don't mean to suggest that there's just one of those."
"Unknown","01;47;50;11","01;48;07;09","I think that but I do think we can sort of average over different perspectives to get that. So like the individual perspectives ultimately are what's real. But if we want to talk about things that are abstract level, we could average over those. And I think that's kind of what Louis tries to do. So maybe this is something we'll get into next week."
"Unknown","01;48;08;11","01;48;34;23","But really he when he talks about folk psychology, he he engineers it so that it doesn't have to be that there's just one set of statements that embodies what people think about psychology. It's like a disjunction of different sets that mostly overlap and just yeah, I mean, pluralism is really, I think is is a good ideal in many contexts."
"Unknown","01;48;35;14","01;48;54;29","I actually think this would be interesting. This might be controversial. I think it's not always the goal in science, because if you start out with pluralism, then you just don't do anything right. It's like, OK, everything's fine as it is. But I think sometimes we're seeking a unifying underlying explanation. And if you accept pluralism at the start, then you will get there."
"Unknown","01;48;55;25","01;49;15;20","That tension, which is OK, pluralism, everybody must be pluralist. And this is the only way it's actually absolutist and singular at a higher level. And so pluralism means that we each do have our perspectives, and yet there is a way of working. It's not just the same thing as saying we have an absolute answer, and it's that there's no answer."
"Unknown","01;49;16;01","01;49;47;01","That's the kind of local logical paradoxes that we see all around us. That's a great point, Stephen. And then anyone else? Yeah, that's that's the, the rabbit hole of postmodernism. I read that one ago, but is this good? This is a really rich conversation, and I think, like you say, it's to be able to jump from Helmholtz to some of these transcultural things is, you know, it shows you that it's pretty foundation or some of the stuff we're touching."
"Unknown","01;49;47;01","01;50;08;09","So that's great. So thanks for a lovely a lovely talk today. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Any closing notes there, Alex? Otherwise, we're all going to probably relisten and reread and think about what would be good to ask next week. Yeah, and no thank thank you all. It's really fascinating. And fun and just want to do more of it next week."
"Unknown","01;50;08;09","01;50;27;18","I'm very I didn't have anything else to say, but I kept speaking. I'm not sure why some of you that do that. Sometimes it happens. So thanks again, everybody who's participating live and on Livestream. And we will see you next week."
