"Unknown","00;00;09;27","00;00;36;00","OK. Hello, everyone. We are live. Welcome to Active Flab live stream number 22.2. Nice repeating digits there. We're here with Alex Kieffer and others. We're going to be having our second follow up discussion on the paper. We've been discussing for the little last bit. Psychophysical identity and free energy. It's May 25th 20, 21. And this will be a great discussion."
"Unknown","00;00;36;02","00;00;57;26","So thanks again for everybody who's joining live as well as watching and replay. If you're watching live especially feel welcome to add a comment in the live chat that we can address Welcome to Active Lab, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at the links that are listed here."
"Unknown","00;00;58;20","00;01;39;18","This is recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us feedback so that we all can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams. We are here in the second of the two discussions in late May 21 and happy to have Alex joining us for both of these discussions which has been great today in 22.2 quick correction we will be just trying to learn and discuss enjoying these conversations, seeing where they go, enjoying what questions bring up and also carrying on with a few of the topics that we knew that we wanted to cover from last week."
"Unknown","00;01;40;14","00;02;07;05","And with that being said, we can jump right in so we can go to the introductions and we'll just maybe go around, introduce ourselves, say hello and then end with Alex and Alex would be happy to hear your thoughts or reflections in this past week. So I'm Daniel. I'm a post-doctoral researcher in California. And I'll pass to Dean Hi folks."
"Unknown","00;02;07;05","00;02;24;08","I'm Dean. I'm from Calgary. And yeah, I'll pass it to Adam I'm Adam. I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Science."
"Unknown","00;02;26;25","00;03;01;22","And Steven. Oh, hello. I mean, Steven, I'm in Toronto. I'm a community development practitioner owner and a flight suit artist, and I'm doing a practice based at the moment. And I'll pass over to Alex the Alex or other Alex. I think you're the only Alex right now. OK, OK. I wasn't sure there's a fellow jester. I want you to oh."
"Unknown","00;03;01;22","00;03;26;29","So I'm Alex Kieffer. Thanks for having me back and talk about this paper. I'm a philosopher. I'm currently affiliated with Monash University, and I'm also doing more applied work for Nested Mines Solutions, so a kind of active influence. I start up cool. There's a few ways we can start, but why don't you feel free to give any opening?"
"Unknown","00;03;26;29","00;03;53;08","Yes. And then we can ask questions. We have some other slides right. So you asked about my reflections over the past week. I haven't reflected a whole lot on deep themes. I did go through. So in the point zero discussion, there was a sort of a question about how we get from 2.1 equation two to one to 22 with the flipping of the PS and Qs."
"Unknown","00;03;53;17","00;04;12;01","So that strikes me as like not the most central theme we can spend time on, but I did just spend some time writing out the derivation if that's something we can get to at some point. But in general, like I guess my feeling is I think last week was really fun and we kind of it was very far ranging."
"Unknown","00;04;13;28","00;04;34;27","I I, I think it would be fun to like to drill down a bit more on some of the specifics this week. But, you know, it's kind of also whatever people want to say. So that's, that's what I'd be interested in doing. Thank you, Alex. Welcome. Lou, if you'd like to just say hi, we're having intros and then we'll sort of walk through some jokes and questions Good morning."
"Unknown","00;04;34;27","00;05;02;20","I'm Blue Knight. I'm an independent research consultant based out of New Mexico. Cool. So there's a bunch of places that we wrote down to jump in. Maybe actually we could go to Dean's three functions, walk into a bar. So it's Slide 11 and I'll have it up large on the stream. So, Dean, why don't you unpack what you were thinking here and let's get some initial reads to get the contrast of ball rolling."
"Unknown","00;05;03;26","00;05;40;18","Well, essentially what the the point two aspect of this process does is it takes basically what we've introduced as as the topic try to gain some interpretation around it. And then so what does that mean? What does that turn into? And so one of the products of that for me was I kind of went back and reviewed the the 22.1 and one of the things about what you mentioned, Alex, was the explanation of a simple idea."
"Unknown","00;05;41;08","00;06;02;21","And I thought that was really important. And so what can that what can that turn into that simple idea? That was the the three functions walk into a bar piece and essentially spoke to what Scott was talking about last time in terms of paradoxes and what do those mean and when do we model and when do we fall a little bit?"
"Unknown","00;06;02;21","00;06;31;20","I thought the bottom part was was an important piece in terms of you mentioning that you saw continuities and I wondered if you were referring to cynicism and that idea of how we take discontinuities and turn them into continuities. And that's that's really interesting. So I had never heard of cynicism. I keep trying to pierce through like strange avenues that were not planned."
"Unknown","00;06;32;12","00;06;56;11","I never consciously thought of it this way. But this kind of nicely summarizes, like, how I see things and the way I've just been sort of forced by experience to approach philosophy. It's like, like like I've found it difficult or impossible to draw, to draw boundaries that would create discontinuities between categories quite generally. So you know, that gets into things like the surrealist paradox."
"Unknown","00;06;56;11","00;07;15;22","There's plenty of examples of this, but I think it's for me, it's much harder to find a discontinuity than to yeah. Then the opposite. OK, can you maybe just walk us through these three functions walking into a bar? What what is the narrative here? And where does it sit in relation to the paper?"
"Unknown","00;07;17;24","00;07;50;19","You're asking me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, so, so essentially if we're, if we're going to, if we're going to talk about contrast of Divergent, which I think is a critical path to understanding how we move down a gradient and arrive at some sort of generative model. I think that there are three functions that essentially exist in that it's an inversion process, which I again, I'm not going to go into the, the, the, the, the, the reads on that."
"Unknown","00;07;50;19","00;08;29;27","There's an identity piece which is spoken to explicitly in Alex's paper and then there's the contrast of diverse contrasts, the divergence piece, which enables a person to remain balanced despite the fact that they don't have a particular answer, that there are hidden states. And I think what a lot of what was being spoken to last time Scott mentioned some things Blue Stephen, was things like scale, which don't necessarily we don't come at it with with the same perception as to what we're looking at."
"Unknown","00;08;30;19","00;08;59;26","Some of us look at things a little bit on a grander model and some of this like it on a granular model. And I think that the part of being able to fit that into a form like the joke, the three, three guys walk into a bar or whatever kind of speaks to the fact that if you think that this is going to be about stability, you're going to get interrupted by the change aspect of it."
"Unknown","00;08;59;26","00;09;24;06","If you think it's going to be all about the change piece, you're not going to be able to realize any sort of conceptualizations because conceptualizations require stability. So you have to kind of be able to play. And both fields at the same time. And that's hard. And I think that's why Alex's paper probably knocked me down about five times when I first read it."
"Unknown","00;09;24;06","00;09;56;13","Because you actually did Alex, try to somehow pull together the ideal idea of stabilizing something, even though things were pretty choppy and and rather dynamic. So I don't know if this is an example of where the part two of us discussing your paper goes, but I think it's it's interesting, especially in the context of synergism and your idea that we're constantly trying to move from the unknown to the known as opposed to the traditional."
"Unknown","00;09;56;22","00;10;24;01","This is what I know. And I'm moving into these unknown spaces that reminds me of then anyone, Alex or anyone else reminds me of sort of two complimentary ways of thinking about education with the tabula rasa, the blank slate, the inscription is put into it's like filling the cup with knowledge or inscribing into something that's template lists. And then the alternative is to burn away ignorance."
"Unknown","00;10;24;14","00;10;51;06","And so it's almost like a move whether we're moving from the known into the unknown or the unknown towards the unknown. There are our left and on right hands of education, right yeah. Yeah. This is really cool. I mean, it it seems like a dream. Like you have a knack for like reading, reading things in a sort of very deeper, almost allegorical way."
"Unknown","00;10;51;08","00;11;21;17","We're talking about a version where. Yeah, yeah. I read Charles Saunders, Pierce two decades ago before it became popular. Right. So yeah. So so it's I think it's interesting and it's it's all these connections are really there. But I just, just to, to comment on this for a second. So, so, so I do think that there's something about just the how ubiquitous sort of dynamism is and all this and how there's in a sense, there's no stable process that we can latch on to here."
"Unknown","00;11;21;17","00;11;53;16","But when I was talking about contrastive divergence, my main point was just, well, look, that's I'm thinking of that very narrowly as a machine learning like an unsupervised learning algorithm. Right. Which I know you have that in mind, too, but you're also taking a broader picture so my point in contrasting contrast of divergence to simulated annealing was we can suppose that the brain is running something like contrast the divergence where it's trying to it's trying to reach a lower energy state."
"Unknown","00;11;54;26","00;12;32;05","But, you know, the way that algorithm works, of course, you don't need to actually run. Right. The basic idea is that you don't need to. So so OK, sorry that we take a step back for a second. Right. So like one way of doing this sort of unsupervised learning would be to to take the distribution over hidden states in a neural net that's induced by an input and try to lower the energy of those states while raising the energy of the fantasies that the network would produce top down."
"Unknown","00;12;32;06","00;12;55;23","Right and so the ideal way to do that would be to run run the network until it reaches its equilibrium distribution and sample from that. When you're doing a negative, the negative phase of this of increasing the energy of the or the therefore lowering the probability of this analysis contrast, the divergence just takes a shortcut and just runs this for like one step or two steps or whatever."
"Unknown","00;12;56;25","00;13;17;15","So I just want to make that clear. I don't know if it's clear for everyone in the audience who hasn't looked at this deeply that that that's the specific contrast that I want to draw. There was just was just between that and a process like simulated annealing where if you if you run it to the to the end of the process, you end up reaching the lowest possible energy state."
"Unknown","00;13;18;13","00;13;42;25","So the brain I guess my point is the brain doesn't necessarily need to be settling to and this does, I think, connect directly. Your point doesn't need to be settling to a completely stable state or even any particular like metastable state. It just has to be there has to be this gradient, right? Yeah. That is available. But I do think that there's a deeper point here, right?"
"Unknown","00;13;42;25","00;14;16;19","So the ness or the non equilibrium steady state that organisms are are approaching as they as they do this variational inference thing is not any kind of final you know, it's not a it's not an esthetic state like some kind of ultimate equilibrium. Right. Well, going down a set of stairs then what the one steady thing is that I remain balanced and not go tumbling to my right heights."
"Unknown","00;14;16;19","00;14;35;29","Right. That's the one steady thing. The one balance thing. And then there's the gradient itself. That's why the there's a next slide that kind of speaks to the that piece of it. And I that's that's all I basically wanted to bring up because I think and I think the cynic is in piece embrace it entails all of that."
"Unknown","00;14;36;06","00;15;16;22","There's there's a dynamic piece and there's a balancing piece and you and you want to be able to sort of address both. That's that's cool. Yep thank you Dean Stephen and then out of there's interesting questions here for pragmatism and social constructivism you know in terms of how these ideas roll out into how we might talk to other people in the world around projects and stuff because of this implication so I wonder how you would bring in this kind of embodiment of that."
"Unknown","00;15;17;23","00;15;46;11","So if the brain is an organ that is doing expected more than expected free energy with the nervous system to help to manage the movement of the organism and the organism overall has got that variation of free energy to maintain homeostasis. We we've got this he's got this energy balance piece, but you've also got that need for entropy."
"Unknown","00;15;46;29","00;16;10;15","So I wonder how we how this can inform this just like people when we do have, you know, about the Alexander technique, but it's when someone's when you think about the body in the skeleton, we think about it as just the bones. But actually it's really everything's held together in a muscular sort of watery soup and, and, and with attendants and everything."
"Unknown","00;16;10;15","00;16;36;22","So there needs to be some noise in there that that entropy piece needs to be there when you're going down. This thing is not you can't be frozen you're full yet. You need to have some of that energy equilibrium because again, you're fall. So this I wonder how if we were to talk to someone out there about their life and their world and walking down the stairs, what what would we translate this in their language?"
"Unknown","00;16;38;28","00;17;06;23","Alex, if you want to give a thought on that, I'm thinking about it. I'm not sure beyond saying that, I do think that there's a balance of two sort of forces or quantities here always. But this reminds me actually, I'm not going to try to put words in your mouth, but this reminds me of Adam, of your your remarks about free will and relation to degrees of freedom and entropy and stuff."
"Unknown","00;17;08;04","00;17;32;00","So that's a Segway, but it doesn't have to be taken up. Cool. Yeah, it reminds me of the stream of consciousness or walking down stairs. You can't just stop there statically can't stop anywhere along the staircase and you can't halt the stream of thought. So what is happening that's allowing time t plus one to be generated from time."
"Unknown","00;17;32;00","00;18;21;19","T The state only has to move by one moment at a time. It doesn't have to do the ultimate steady state to the lowest possible energy. So Adam and then anyone else raising their hand um, I reread your paper last night, and it's even better the second time I'd like to actually talk to you later. About getting into the weeds about different, uh, like mappings on the neural level of like between the thermodynamic and the informational, but the before we move on, I was wondering how you'd feel about like a multi phase or a multiple part description of neural architecture where like there's some aspects which might be more annealing like and some aspects that"
"Unknown","00;18;21;19","00;18;49;05","might be more contrastive like so like you could like for instance, tell a story of like some sort of predictive workspace where like you can think of it as like the model selection as like iterative annealing potentially in terms of some of its aspects. But then like it's just like a round like you you could think of like, like, like, like a dance style ignition event as you're generating this, this big high temperature complex but then settles down and selects the model."
"Unknown","00;18;49;16","00;19;17;08","But this would just be like one of the things that's happened, like something contrastive could be like the thalamus, like maybe like orchestrating different cycles and comparing them or hippocampal system. And that could be like junior contrasts. Would that be copacetic with that? Right, yeah. No, that sounds, that sounds awesome. I mean, in general, it seems consistent with like the way I've just I've learned to see these things, you know, just, just paying attention to all these different sources of evidence."
"Unknown","00;19;17;08","00;19;47;11","It seems like yeah. This kind of it sounds right to me. I guess my only uncertainty is like the reason I focus on on this contrast was in part because I wanted to argue for, as you know, for an identity between the, the energy free energy and the thermodynamic sense and in the variational sense relevant to the inference."
"Unknown","00;19;47;11","00;20;20;04","And so I needed to I needed to make explicit the argument that whatever is going on, even if if there's sort of a multiple timescales in which this is happening, or if there are different parts of the system that are in effect being anneal to different degrees, that the whole thing, it's not possible to think that the whole thing settles to like, you know, the lowest possible energy state while it's alive."
"Unknown","00;20;21;02","00;20;44;25","So anyway, I don't mean to like deflect I think what you just throw out I was really interesting and you probably know more about the relevant, you know, in Toronto mechanisms that I do. So I can't like critique that idea, but it sounds as you said, copacetic. Yeah. Adam, you want to add something there? I mean, yeah, I wouldn't want to like distract you like the point of like if we actually you have to not be at equilibrium."
"Unknown","00;20;44;25","00;21;09;15","You have to have this, like, open mindedness and dynamics to keep the process going. But and I don't know, like a productive like sometimes like I'll squinted like in different machine learning algorithms and like, you know, push them a little bit further. So like you could think of this iterative Bayesian selection as like a kind of annealing one that could not be productive potentially, even though aspects of it could be described that way."
"Unknown","00;21;10;03","00;21;27;20","Yeah, well, that's a good I mean, it's kind of a good way of framing it. Like, I think this goes back to this syncretism cynic schism thing. Like, I think you can probably always redescribe something in terms of something else, but it's a question of how useful it is. And, and I never exactly know where the boundary is, right?"
"Unknown","00;21;28;05","00;21;55;20","What becomes just kind of a fanciful like phosphorus trick versus what's useful but the thing that you're suggesting sounds like it would be a useful way of thinking about things. And, and when I contrast contrast of divergence and annealing, when I think of annealing, I think of DNA in the test tube as you turn the temperature down. So you come to a final frozen state, that's like a fixed crystal, essentially, whereas the idea of contrast of divergence, it's more like cybernetics."
"Unknown","00;21;55;20","00;22;15;18","It's like a guiding and a navigation on a flow already. And so even if you didn't have any divergence at all between your North Star and your head or where you're going and where you want to go, you still would be moving. And so in that sense, even if you're trying to minimize the divergence, there still is a sense of movements."
"Unknown","00;22;15;26","00;22;40;02","Whereas in simulated annealing, the idea that there's no difference is more associated with a crystalline or a static state. So they have very different sort of tliose almost and four dynamic systems that person going down the stairs, stream of consciousness action selection in an uncertain world that feels more like the cybernetic navigation rather than the DNA in a test tube."
"Unknown","00;22;40;12","00;23;13;17","So those are just some aspects. So Stephen and then Adam that that idea of how things keep going and the dynamics I'll be interested in your thoughts about how that might play out in in behavior or in the world. So I could imagine in the Elian being a little bit like if things are trying to hibernate, there may be a state where they can go closets is like like glass glass gets in."
"Unknown","00;23;13;17","00;23;47;19","You basically that's how you plunge into a water it holds that liquid state even though it's colder than liquid. But the the question I have is, is how do you reconcile some of these these these these questions around where we can get caught in loops for instance, you know, like Casper has talked about depression, but you're seeing a lack of affordance in the environment and that could be concern in your predictions."
"Unknown","00;23;47;26","00;24;22;15","You can get kind of caught in a loop. And some of those challenges in computational psychiatry are they're sort of low energy. I actually haven't gotten on this. It's made me think there's sort of low energy sex, but also like looping transformation, restates you know, where you get a reduction in free energy relative to some some sort of stick in the sand that is been established for the priors and the dynamics and then it kind of gets stuck in that, you know, be it, you know, high activity, something that's outside of where the organism want to be."
"Unknown","00;24;22;15","00;24;46;02","But it's still going there. And I don't know if that's quite the same as going into the sort of a low energy equilibrium. You're not going to it's not necessarily going down in energy. It's sort of getting caught in a loop. So of vibrational free energy. Yeah, that's that's really interesting, actually. I'm sorry. It was someone else wanted to know Alex OK, after your thoughts, we'll go to Adam."
"Unknown","00;24;46;27","00;25;07;05","Yeah. So I mean, my, my, my intuitive reaction is that is that. Yeah, something like that happens in depression. There's a sense in which it's a low energy state in my paper, which is kind of like a sophisticated argument for a really simple minded idea. I want to identify that those two things and say, yeah, it's physically a low energy state as well."
"Unknown","00;25;08;15","00;25;28;18","But it's a local one. So that, again, is my intuition at the moment. I don't know if it'll be borne out or if it'll work, but it seems like sometimes in depression maybe we reach like, yeah, like a local energy minimum in a certain part of the network or something, but it's not part of an overall optimal state for the organism when it comes to behavior and things like that."
"Unknown","00;25;30;03","00;25;34;25","It's really interesting to think about how that happens. Yep. Thanks, Adam."
"Unknown","00;25;39;12","00;26;03;22","Actually, despite what Steven just mentioned, there's a within like the psychedelic research community, there's interesting models based on therapy of change through annealing, where like Johnson of the Quality Research Institute has something called like the neural theory or theory of annealing, where it's the psychedelic state increases the temperature helps you to breakout, and then you can crystallize new regime."
"Unknown","00;26;03;22","00;26;30;01","And Robin Hood Harris is described in very similar terms. Yeah. One thing about like generalizations of kneeling that came to mind when Dan was talking was Doug Hofstetter and Melanie Mitchell with their copycat architecture, they said it's different from annealing, but it had something was kind of like ant colony optimization, annealing, where there would be a temperature parameter for when your analogies weren't fitting."
"Unknown","00;26;30;11","00;26;51;20","And so you can think of like some sort of contrasts of bits saying like how good is your like matches how good is like these analogical matching like the st comparisons? And then this parameter rises the temperature of a continuously adjusted annealing process. It doesn't settle and and more recently, really interestingly as well, from the beginning, the language was completely like workspace up."
"Unknown","00;26;51;29","00;27;31;01","And more recently that Melanie Mitchell is like explicitly drawing a connection to the global in her workspace theory. And so there could be like a generalized annealing that provides that it has a contrast of bits and an annealing generalized annealing. But that does give you like two kinds of like psychophysical identity mappings maybe, and a total a total speculative note would be sometimes we have, you know, accuracy minus complexity or pragmatic versus epistemic gain, maybe some decision making approaches that are able to hold both together and maybe even rebalance between those different modes."
"Unknown","00;27;32;00","00;27;58;29","Dean, I'd like to actually go to 12 and hear a little bit more on what you thought about contrastive diversions before we head to the next topic. So what did you see or find interesting on Slide 12? What brought you to that slide? Well, I'd actually looked at stuff from all over Woodford before, and so that was kind of why again, I was I was sort of I was connecting dots in my own head."
"Unknown","00;27;59;11","00;28;24;18","And so it's interesting because the parts that Adam and Stephen just brought up in part and part of our conversations off offline, one of the questions I asked Daniel and Blue was around the idea. So you have the physical math and you have the statistical math and somehow they come together and make babies. And that's what we kind of have here."
"Unknown","00;28;24;26","00;28;53;22","And so what is this? What is this project? And all I liked about the the not too not to discount or put aside the simulated annealing piece, but to give what what I think happens as if, for example, when the person goes down, goes down the stairs under control as opposed to falling to their death, you know, lowest energy state."
"Unknown","00;28;55;01","00;29;17;15","I thought that this essentially spoke to it by just giving a nice metaphor in terms of shining the torch beam in our chosen direction of travel, which allows us to see the lowest point in the field in that direction, which I think Alex was again addressing. I don't think, Alex, you meant to make this such a central point of your paper."
"Unknown","00;29;17;15","00;29;46;28","But I thought in terms of trying to explicate the simple idea, the fact that you didn't just focus on the fact that there's a gradient, but how does a person move down that gradient and not lose control, which is kind of what I wanted to bring forward here. And in the notes at the bottom, which I can't see on my screen, there's a really nice explanation for what contrast of divergence has in terms of being an assistant."
"Unknown","00;29;47;18","00;30;04;05","That's why I want to bring that one for you. Alex, if you want to give a thought on that. And then, Stephen, I don't know how much of the thought. I mean, I think it's it's a really cool angle that you have on this. And it's I think it's again, it's, it's something that's there, even if it wasn't my intended focus."
"Unknown","00;30;04;25","00;30;09;28","And it reinforces, I think, some of the themes that I was focusing on. Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;30;12;16","00;30;45;15","So what I think is quite useful and I'm kind of be sort of bringing this idea of if I was trying to explain this to an arts practitioner or someone who does in a psycho therapy or something, how to explain the implications. And one thing that I think it's important here is when you talk about that energy minima, I try to jump to the bottom of a hill I metaphysically I might know that I'm at a lower energy potential energy overall, but actually I probably get a higher energy when I hit the floor for a while."
"Unknown","00;30;46;05","00;31;12;01","Right as I start to get stressed and perspire and assuming I'm not just completely squished to oblivion. So you're in this interesting you know, I suppose we do that on rollercoasters a little bit, but we there is there's what we all infer in about our states is what it is, because we don't directly experience being at the lower energy state."
"Unknown","00;31;12;24","00;31;45;06","We experience what us and so states enable us to infer about the results of our actions. So and then from that we compare that to our expectations based on the stick in the sand or the big sticks in the sand, which is our phenotype, which is what we can then use as something to anchor against so I'm wondering that that has an implication about how people think about the world because of these types of ideas."
"Unknown","00;31;45;19","00;32;09;07","You know, this there's this sense that they are connected and interconnected at the same time. They're always separate in terms of being able to touch something because they're not touching something. They're getting sensory data which makes them get allows that model to predict what they've just done. They didn't actually touch in the way that people might think they've touched."
"Unknown","00;32;09;17","00;32;28;28","So I'm just putting that out. There is some question yet. Alex Yeah. For it. Yeah. That so there's there's this piece of what you keep doing. Stephen You keep trying to make this like put like put all this in touch with like the body in the world and stuff. And I'm like, No, let me just stay in my internal model."
"Unknown","00;32;29;13","00;33;06;27","I worry about that. But so I don't know, actually, I don't know if I, if I understood the thrust of just like the last couple sentences is. But I think the point that there's the fact is we don't we're not yeah. We don't just want to like leap to the lowest energy state possible come what may. Right. It's much more about the process and I think what you said about the this thing being anchored in the phenotype and you know, the priors, general, is, is, is really important 11 another paper that I wanted to write or I don't know if it's a paper or maybe it's just a blog post or a tweet or something,"
"Unknown","00;33;06;27","00;33;31;00","but it's just on the back of that. Yeah. So like you always have to bear in mind when you're talking about this energy minimization process that this is all relative to a phenotype which itself embodies some amount of energy. Right. And so in fact, you might even say that the stable phenotypes are some kind of like optimal tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, right?"
"Unknown","00;33;31;03","00;33;48;26","Just in themselves. So there's this force that's sort of pushing up from below, which is just the having a phenotype complex enough to predict anything. And you have to work within that, like those boundaries so I don't know if that really addresses your point because again, I totally missed that. The embodiment part just like flew by me. But it's, it's nice."
"Unknown","00;33;48;27","00;34;12;12","Just one point and then Adam. So I really like that example of a person or a body in motion going down the stairs and the difference between the controlled walking down the stairs or maybe even using an assisted mobility device and then falling down the stairs. And both of them can't stop at one moment. Whether you're tumbling or whether you're walking, you still can't stop there."
"Unknown","00;34;12;19","00;34;37;07","So it's always dynamical and you are going downhill and you are converting your potential energy into, you know, going to a lower energy state. So those two are good ways to think about where does bodily control and motor coordination, which we'll talk about in 23 soon with embodied skill for performance but let's think about a mountain climber that's somebody who's actually contrastive lead diverging uphill."
"Unknown","00;34;38;00","00;35;02;12","And so that shows us that it's not just like the die is cast and then whether you fall or control on the way down, but there's a way in which going to the top of the mountain is like going downhill or kneeling or reducing the contrast and divergence relative to your expectations of where you want to be. And now you can imagine if the water levels rising going uphill is a survival strategy."
"Unknown","00;35;02;26","00;35;26;20","So we want to have a way of describing where does control and bodily control come into the picture going downhill and then even generalizing beyond just bodies with mass falling in a controlled or uncontrolled fashion towards the kind of cybernetic planning that could actually result in a mountain climber, for example, going a little downhill and little to the side and then making their way up the mountain."
"Unknown","00;35;26;24","00;35;53;04","So Alex, then Adam and Steve. Yeah, yeah. And that's really it's a really good point to bring up, especially in this context of, you know, of the thrust of trying to simplify things by identifying physical and psychological things like no, sometimes you want to climb the mountain. So I mean, my may, my immediate way of trying to summarize how that would work is just, well, you've got a strong prediction that yeah, that you want to be at the top of the mountain, right?"
"Unknown","00;35;53;04","00;36;11;04","That's your sort of, that's your sort of desire distribution. It defines your desired distribution of our observations and so that's going to that's going to drive you to climb the mountain. But I think that the way it does that is approximately is that there's going to be an actual, I would say, an actual physical disequilibrium in the brain."
"Unknown","00;36;11;23","00;36;57;01","Right. That's caused by the discrepancy between your predicted state and the state that you're inferring from your observations and lowering that, you know, that potential is what drives the action of actually climbing the mountain. So yeah. Cool. Awesome. Adam And then Steven head spinning a little bit, but hopefully this works. Work is like up, down. But I'm wondering in terms of something like depression and could we think of it as like a very high local minima and like if we thought of like what we would expect?"
"Unknown","00;36;57;04","00;37;21;16","So I guess what is it that's being predicted? At which level of the generative model, like what is it? Everything is what's, what's being predicted. Like and actively like between the worries Minnich and what's been predicted over the whole like skinny encapsulate organism, the brain and then subsystems there could be some. Ultimately they have to come to some kind of harmony, but they could diverge."
"Unknown","00;37;21;16","00;37;50;20","But the idea would be like thinking of a a landscape that like when the energy's high, it might be more jagged and it might be more likely to get stuck at like local you're stuck at this local minima and you want to get to that really low one. And so you could think of something like niche construction as like looking for a catalyst to like try to like smooth out like make a more navigable landscape."
"Unknown","00;37;50;20","00;38;06;13","Or you could think of like the psychedelic would be like a turning the heat. So I'm thinking of the difference between like a, a thermodynamic versus a kinetically favorable chemical reactions like you might like. Yeah, it's theory if you can get from there, there you come up ahead with the output with the amplitude. But you can't get there."
"Unknown","00;38;06;13","00;38;29;04","It's not kinetically favorable. And so like the different things we're doing is trying to like find ways of getting kinetic favourability for, for this thermodynamic favourability and bring those into alignment. Very nice, Adam. You can build that bridge. You don't have to afford the river or swim across or you can just pray for the quantum tunnel to appear so."
"Unknown","00;38;29;04","00;39;03;03","But they do. Stephen And then in wow case there's something very quite important here, I think because OK, we're, we're minimizing this energy gradient. OK, that's fair enough. Particularly for robots. Which are using reinforcement approaches and they're basically working on energy gradients. And then you've got the idea of you can work with variational approaches, i.e. more like this gives free energy where the reaction can slightly have entropy."
"Unknown","00;39;03;16","00;39;24;10","But the big T thing as well, if you're going to take your agent is that we're at the level of the chemistry is the chemistry is non equilibrium chemistry. So the whole of the gives free energy is built on equilibrium chemistry. Here we've got a non equilibrium chemistry when you get to the matter of the organisms and the cells and the and everything."
"Unknown","00;39;24;10","00;39;57;27","So I think what's an interesting point here is so you're going down the stairs, you're trying to fall over, you're being a rock climber. So overall there's this energy piece around how the agent moves for the agents and moves. Unlike a robot, you might have the old pistons, the actual cells in that are operating that this non equilibrium state and quite how different actually this gap between these attractor basins versus energy basins which we normally think of."
"Unknown","00;39;57;27","00;40;30;06","I actually don't know. I don't even know. I'm interested to ask how fits that? Like what is how much does it shift things to have basins to do with attractors as opposed to just basins to do with energy equilibrium, energy gradients. And and that's the thing that's different in terms of what's really going on when I'm climbing a mountain or that is all my muscles in that at the actual level of making things happen, a swarm in and trying to enable this kind of biological process to happen."
"Unknown","00;40;30;26","00;40;58;28","And OK, from a system perspective, I can see the energy being less for me falling on the ground, but for my muscles to move and everything there, they're operating at this non equilibrium process and which will have energy impacts but also as some other types of dynamics which you don't have, you have this non equilibrium steady state dynamic which you don't get in traditional chemistry."
"Unknown","00;40;59;12","00;41;18;20","So there's something there. I'm just sort of I'm not saying I expect an answer in that, but I think it's a, it's an important point that seems to be a gap. It just it really shone out for me there. Nice. Thanks, Steven. It's kind of like if it's a ball at the bottom of a ball, then it's, it's that's the annealing, it's the crystal state with a ball in the ball."
"Unknown","00;41;19;00","00;41;49;10","But then if you have a neuron that's holding a resting voltage that is being actively maintained with an enormous expenditure of energy, but it's its own kind of ball that it's converging to, whether it's above or below its set points it still doing a type of convergence, but it's a dynamically held state. And you're absolutely right that sometimes the lower level entity or the entity which the larger one is composed of, they have their own active dynamics."
"Unknown","00;41;49;19","00;42;13;11","Even when the top level system is at rest or appears to be unmoving, so Dean and then we have a few other fun topics that we'll get to. Well, I'm going to see if it's OK to ask ask Alex to jump to a third rail at this point, because I'm really, really curious about the modified Ramsay sentence aspect of his paper."
"Unknown","00;42;13;17","00;42;38;14","What I was hoping he might be able to speak to a little bit about is not just what that what the Ramsay sentence is talking about, but the implications in terms of different time intervals and what that role that plays in us, being able to understand how the modified Ramsay sentence works. In your paper perfect. I switched to that slide 44."
"Unknown","00;42;38;25","00;43;02;25","So yeah, I was definitely curious about that as well. Alex, what does the Ramsay sentence or this entire area of formal logic, how did that come into play? Yeah, so right. I kind of trumped up the Ramsay sentence thing in the last episode, but it's kind of silly of me because there's not a whole lot to it and in a way, but then it maybe that's just how it seems to me from the perspective of where I'm coming from."
"Unknown","00;43;02;25","00;43;35;03","But the reason this is in here is that the whole identity, the philosophical mind, brand identity piece of this is based on I was mostly inspired by David Lewis's approach to that topic. And so there there are a couple of influential approaches. There's Lewis and there's Smart, I guess the two big papers, but basically what what this piece of formal logic is doing is just trying to capture what what a theory says about the entities that it sort of implicitly defines or how you could get from."
"Unknown","00;43;37;03","00;44;02;25","This isn't all explicitly spelled out graphically, but how you could get from just a collection of statements that you might have sent to about whatever the topic happens to be. In this case, we're talking about mental states from that to a a theory that's expressed in general terms and that again, implicitly defines the are the entities that figure as the value, the values of these variables here."
"Unknown","00;44;04;08","00;44;18;15","So the right so I mean, we could briefly talk about this, I guess. Is it useful to go over this? Yeah. You guys. Yeah. So read out the sentence or translate it or provide an example. Sure."
"Unknown","00;44;20;18","00;44;41;00","So, right. So I guess I'll start with just the Ramsay sentence and we'll talk about modified versions in a second. But so the first symbol here, as you guys discussed in point zero, was just an existential quantifier. It says there's some X such that whatever follows the second symbols, the universal quantifier over the variable Y. So it says there's some X such that for all Y, blah, blah, blah."
"Unknown","00;44;41;15","00;45;07;09","And here T, the predicate is just literally like so say that you had a collection of platitudes or they don't I don't want to complicate things, just the collection of statements like when I see when I see a cat, I'm happy. When I think about happiness, I tend to think about sunshine, things like that. Right. Just some examples and so you just conjoin all those."
"Unknown","00;45;07;09","00;45;30;15","Just put an end between all of the sentences of that type that you could think of in this domain. In this case, it's folk psychology and so then you'd have, you'd have a a a long sentence, right? It's a giant conjunction now that has some terms that refer to mental states like believe, arguably. See, although maybe some people would interpret that as a physical state."
"Unknown","00;45;30;15","00;45;55;09","There's definitely very blurriness here at the edges. But in any case, things like believe, desire, think, these are clearly mental state terms, right? So you have this long sentence that has those terms and also other terms. And so essentially you just you replace each of the terms in question, the mental state terms with a variable. And what's left over is the predicate that defines what the sentence is saying about those the values of those variables."
"Unknown","00;45;55;16","00;46;28;10","Right. And then you just append these quantifier the beginning just to to sort of spell out what your what kind of claim you're making about the states in question. Namely, there is such a there is something such that it relates to all of the things in this way. And so that's that's the basic Ramzy sentence. It's just it's an abstraction that allows you to just go out form informal logic and for sort of predicate logic, like what a collection of sentences says about something."
"Unknown","00;46;29;00","00;46;48;01","And the last piece here is the so there's the if and only if the three bars that's the resilient uniqueness condition. So this goes back to Russell's theory of definite descriptions. So like I mean, my start, by the way, was in sort of philosophy of language and stuff. So that's why this is in here. I came to the other sort of statistics and physics based stuff much later."
"Unknown","00;46;49;21","00;47;25;23","So so Russell had this, this theory of Definiteness frictions that he was trying to explain how you could have a meaningful expression like the present King of France, even though there is no such thing. So how does how to sell these figures of reference? How do we philosophically handle failures of reference and things like that? And so his his suggestion was that you can think of definite descriptions like the present king of France as of just saying, well, there is something such that it is a present king of France and there's only one of those things, right?"
"Unknown","00;47;25;23","00;47;54;17","So it's like a uniquely satisfying description. And so that's what this part does here. It says this predicate T, which encompasses all of the implicit folk knowledge about mental states in this case, holds holds of something only if that thing is equal to X. And so one last piece that's important here is that I took the bold letters here, X and Y to be like vectors and essentially."
"Unknown","00;47;54;17","00;48;17;14","Right. So like these are we're talking about many different mental states that in parallel we do this. But if you want to, you can just think of it simply as being about one mental state. Then you generalize to all of them. So I don't know where how clear is that? What, what, what it's it's let me try a little bit of a physical example."
"Unknown","00;48;17;14","00;48;51;04","It's like there's the stream of consciousness, the stream of statements, what you said, where there aren't I saw a cat or photons hit my eye and I perceived a cat. So one of those is more of a physical list claim and one of those is more on a mental side. And it's almost like we're going to draw a line around the mental claims just so that they can be definitely interface into a formal logic, even if the contents of that mental experience might not even have a reference in the real world."
"Unknown","00;48;51;12","00;49;14;11","Or it might not be something that exists in the same way that those photons hitting the eyes exist. But it allows us to interface with those kinds of statements by agents in a formal logical framework. Well, I mean, I guess one part I was back on a bit is I mean, this sentence here clearly states that that this X exists, whatever you take that to mean, right?"
"Unknown","00;49;14;11","00;49;37;13","So it could be that there's different criteria for existence, right? In different domains or something, but it definitely said that there exists something such that it's related to all the other things of this kind in the ways that are specified in the predicate. So like, yeah, I think I think that the main I guess the main point here, so I focused on the Ramsay sentence because people are interested in it."
"Unknown","00;49;37;13","00;50;02;11","But the main point is just that you can take all the things that people say about mental states as implicitly defining them in a sort of theory right. And that that's that's it. And so we use this explicitly in the context of trying to identify mental states with brain states. Right? So just to sort of just say a little bit more at this piece."
"Unknown","00;50;02;11","00;50;41;04","And then I'll shut up for a bit. But like if you have this network of relations that's described by a sentence like this, you can take that as implicitly defining the mental states by being neutral about their sort of ontological character. Right. So so it could be then that if you do some neuroscientific investigation and you find, hey, there are these, you know, states in the brain that are they seem to bear the same relations to one another, that these mental states that we were talking about bear to one another, you know, Lewis says, well, then because this the sentence says that the mental states really are just the things that uniquely realize this structure"
"Unknown","00;50;41;04","00;51;04;10","of relations. Well, you've just empirically discovered in the mental states. So it's a really cool way of theoretically bridging something like psychology, intuitive folk psychology and and neuroscience. And Lewis's point was, what, once you have this structure, if you could extract this structure from folk psychology, that's implicit in it. And if you made the empirical discovery, there'd be no further bells and whistles."
"Unknown","00;51;04;10","00;51;33;26","Whistles needed to say that there's an identity, because that's just what the sense says is that the mental states are whatever things satisfy this description. Hmm. Very interesting. So Dean, then Stephen, then Adam. Yeah. So, so Alex. I mean, as it's, as it's written out here, it's, it's really stable. And I'm really curious because I really don't know this do different time intervals, like really, really short time intervals or longer time intervals."
"Unknown","00;51;33;26","00;52;04;07","If I've got a day to go down the stairs versus I've got one second to decide whether the 96 inch drop is less harmful to me than the lion that's chasing me. Do time intervals affect the stability of this right yeah. So so I can walk up to that part of your comment earlier I think. No, as a short answer, I think that this is meant to be a static esthetic sort of description of a, of an implicit theory."
"Unknown","00;52;04;15","00;52;24;24","Right, which which will include statements about short timescales and long timescales. So I would say that that anything about time scales in theory should be captured by the folk psychology that you embody or that you have in mind at the moment. And that might change from one time moment to the next. Also, like this doesn't need to be a temporally static structure."
"Unknown","00;52;25;05","00;53;08;26","So maybe that speaks more your, your point. But, but I think the possibility of, of spelling the structure out even for one instant is, is the is the lever that Lewis uses to, to draw his philosophical conclusions OK, thanks. Thanks, Steven. And then Adam this question about prediction and time, I think like you just saying there may be a sort of a timescale at which things are just flowing, like what sort of speed is it that things are just doing their thing I cells are doing their processes."
"Unknown","00;53;09;19","00;53;28;13","That's what Dean was talking about. Woods is longer time scales than that. And I think like you say, there's something different there. That's the more everything beyond a certain point has to be imagined. I suppose anything that's not possible to do variation of free energy on you've got to do expected free energy and to do expected free energy."
"Unknown","00;53;28;13","00;54;01;06","You basically have to imagine some a bigger imagine in a different way. So just our limited sense of imagination like our body has to imagine at some level the expected free energy is basically what expected free energy is. So I think that's that then does bring in some interesting ideas around folk psychology. Would you say that those mental states should ultimately be action and sensory states that are being predicted?"
"Unknown","00;54;01;22","00;54;32;24","So the mental states are basically the recapitulation or expectation on sensory states and results in beliefs on action states. So that they could be seen as mental states. But actually there is a more distributed realization of that of interest is just that that sort of is something that could hold. Yeah, I mean, I think the spirit of Lewis's proposal is also functionalist, right?"
"Unknown","00;54;32;27","00;54;55;09","So so the basic idea Functionalism, of course, is that mental states in the philosophy of mind is that mental states can be defined in terms of their relations to inputs and outputs. And also to each other. And I guess it's the to each other bit that distinguishes it from behaviorism. So but yeah, I think that these implicit definitions that Lewis talks about would rely heavily."
"Unknown","00;54;55;09","00;55;18;25","It would depend heavily on things like when I believe that there's a cat present, I expect certain visual appearances to occur and I'm disposed to act in certain ways. And maybe you want to cash to the I tend to want to cash the actions and the sensory stuff out in terms of proximal stimuli and like motor effector states rather than distal things and extended things."
"Unknown","00;55;18;25","00;55;53;04","That's just I don't know, that's, that's my my, my, I'm not with a bias or what, it's just the way I tend to think of these things. But definitely I I guess I would say that the relations between the mental states, though, are just as important as their relation to the active states and the sensory states when it comes to this kind of this kind of formalism I missed an opportunity to."
"Unknown","00;55;53;27","00;56;32;00","It was a really interesting comment, actually. I don't know if I did it justice, but I'm still thinking about it. I just just add one little things I just before. Yeah, OK. Very quickly, but one thing that comes to mind that I think might connect to what you're saying and you were talking about this and and and so there seems to be something there about the combination of arms and what's, you know, so for instance, and there was a dog and there was a woman with the dog and we're in the park and the dog was wagging its tail."
"Unknown","00;56;32;24","00;56;56;28","And then there was blood on its teeth when it smiled. And then suddenly that's changed it. Right. So the triangulation of the ends flips. Once you suddenly the dog bears its teeth and you see blood on them. All right. So that links into what they do in qualitative research where they often triangulate to get something which is got trustworthiness rather than accuracy."
"Unknown","00;56;58;21","00;57;19;03","And I think there's something interesting there about what you're saying in terms of that. My knowledge of that field of linguistics is that the if I can bring it back into embodied work, I find it easier. So I'm trying to do this and, and, and, and that's that has got some practical applications. I think in a number of areas."
"Unknown","00;57;20;20","00;57;57;19","Oh, definitely. Yep. Thanks, Adam, if you can return. Yep. OK, go for it. Adam. Hey, making coffee. So I'm eventually I'd like to get to free will and actually loop around a little bit to actually depression as it was the case with respect about. But before we move on from Ramsay's sentences, not to belabor it, but so is the idea that so you strip away the specific entities being signified you look at the syntax and then you're saying, can the same syntax apply in another system?"
"Unknown","00;57;57;19","00;58;18;29","And then you have the mapping that this would be the map. So would is that the basic idea essentially? Yeah. If you take syntax in a, you know, in a slightly broader sense than totally yeah. OK. So I guess I'd be wondering like like in terms of like act of inferential modeling, would it be something like like with like the graphical brain?"
"Unknown","00;58;19;00","00;58;43;23","Like you have like this form factor graph where you have like the continuous regime down below, but then have this like the street regime up top and like maybe something in like the factor graph portion you can look for like some sort of like said polymorphism or isomorphism there or like if it's in brain, you would do some sort of like you would look at ensembles and like describe them as like attractors moving along some sort of manifolds."
"Unknown","00;58;43;23","00;59;19;16","And then like when you screen those or throw a blanket around them or reify in some ways if that if the syntax of their interrelations matches people's subjective reports of their experience, then you would be able to actually potentially identify like physical, substrate, physical and computational substrates of consciousness. Is that I mean, yeah, I think you fire like well they were going that's I think that's where, where we're going except I never made the bridge all the way to consciousness because that's one thing that I, I reserve the right to not decide about."
"Unknown","00;59;19;16","00;59;39;02","I think your work on this is really cool. Actually, I kind of suspect that like most of the main theories of consciousness are kind of overlap a bit. And there's a core that's, you know, it's sort of like getting out of the way things are, which I think you've written about. But so, so I want to just bracket the consciousness thing for a second, although maybe that totally ruined it for you."
"Unknown","00;59;39;02","01;00;02;13","I don't know. But like, I yeah, but that's that's exactly the idea. I think you just expressed it very well that if you work with. Yeah, you have to squint. You have to do some course screening. But if you look at the dynamics of the physical system, you'll be able to discover, in the ideal case, some of the same sort of syntactic relations that you would get from the psychological perspective."
"Unknown","01;00;02;13","01;00;25;17","And I think that's also very consonant with the way, you know, connection modelers describe their work sometimes. So like you think a connection is simple neural network made of these simple processing units, you can derive that architecture just by looking at the brain and sort of very much simplifying things or you could derive the same graphs in some case just by looking at cognitive processes."
"Unknown","01;00;25;29","01;00;51;29","And so it's the idea that you have two perspectives and one thing that if you have a graph isomorphism, then that is what was being hinted at with it being sufficient to find that there's relationships among mental states like I always feel like I feel this way before this other feeling. And then if you found that there was some brain state that always preceded is at the end point or is there still more to explain in that context?"
"Unknown","01;00;52;16","01;01;19;23","Let's actually get to another topic that we highlighted last week, which was the sleep wake example so I'm here on Slide 40 and we're considering a system whose analysis is tractable, at least according to Alex and we have an agent whose behavior as far as Sleep Week is concerned is defined by equation 3.1. So could we walk through what is happening in this simulation?"
"Unknown","01;01;19;23","01;01;46;09","Like what is the agent doing, what is the agent consist of? And then what does the Equation show? And then how does that relate to what we're showing in this paper? Sure. So I think I think this is another aspect of the paper that that was maybe seemed to be making a deeper point than it was. But I'll just talk about this briefly."
"Unknown","01;01;46;09","01;02;29;24","So this was actually just meant to be sort of a slight modification of just like a Helmholtz machine running the sleep algorithm. So I don't know if I need to set that up blue. We talked about that a little bit in 2.0. But the idea was if we just have a generic let's we have a neural network that has a generative model that's sort of encoded in its top down connections and approximate recognition model in the bottom up connections and so so one way of doing this is to run the algorithm where you basically generate states of the network top down like Tennessee's functionally speaking, and then you adjust the bottom of weights so that"
"Unknown","01;02;29;24","01;02;52;04","they're likely to produce those fantasies. And then you you alternate this with the so that's the sleep cycle you alternate this with a wake cycle where you use the input of the kind of sensory data that you want the model to learn to generate. And you do a bottom up pass and then adjust the the top down generative connections that they're more likely to produce those states that are induced by input."
"Unknown","01;02;53;04","01;03;13;14","So so all I was doing here was saying look, if we if we suppose just make the assumption that this is a real system we're talking about, it's ridiculously unrealistic. Right? So this that's why I said it's it's something that's tractable to analyze, but it's also also quite a far cry from anything biologically plausible. But it's not also it's also not completely off the mark."
"Unknown","01;03;13;14","01;03;42;10","Right? So I think there's a reason that the homeless machine was kind of like a seminal moment in the evolution towards what we have now because it got a lot of the course screened sort of conceptual structure really down. I don't know if it had been pulled together before in this form anyway. So let's suppose that the wake and sleep cycles of that machine occur with equal probability, then we can talk about probabilities of certain states occurring in the network just period, right?"
"Unknown","01;03;42;10","01;04;07;27","Whether it's during a sleep or a wake cycle, and so if you just grant that, if you if you ignore the fact that this is a really only and it ends up being an approximation to an approximation right? So it's, it's, it's running its wake sleep ends up being a sort of an approximation to the algorithm, which is itself not quite full variational based."
"Unknown","01;04;09;03","01;04;31;24","So anyway, lots of approximations, but if you ignore that for the moment, I just want to make the point that you could talk, you could talk about the you can thoroughly, completely characterize the possible the probabilities of various states of the system. And so you could use that to define this. This, ah, here is just the probability of a certain state of the system being in a certain state."
"Unknown","01;04;31;25","01;04;38;07","I hear the size referred to like the states of the individual neurons, but that's related in a simple way to the overall state of the network."
"Unknown","01;04;40;09","01;05;06;23","So you can talk about the probability of the system being in one of these states regardless of whether it's running awake or asleep cycle. And then that gives you a if you have a probabilistic description of the states of the whole system, then you could you could use that as a, as it to define the relevant terms in thermodynamic strategy, so the entropy and the energy and such."
"Unknown","01;05;08;06","01;05;38;22","So that's the basic idea. But the part that you that you were wondering about, like what is this system simulating? What does it perceive and such? That's all that's this example is completely agnostic as to any of those details. So once again, this is highly, highly abstract and I apologize. No, it's cool. And what do you think this model would allow us to continue developing towards or what does it show for the argument that you put forth as far as the psychophysical identity thesis?"
"Unknown","01;05;39;29","01;06;08;13","Right. Well, I don't know that it shows anything in itself. I think it was what it was trying to do was was was write down a system in which the target would be clear. So like that you want it to be the case that this our distribution so solving for this right. So the R distribution because it's it's essentially made up of or it's it's factored into these wake and sleep cycles."
"Unknown","01;06;08;13","01;06;39;25","Right? Those have direct interpretations in terms of variation for energy of inference. And yet we have a well-defined distribution over the states of the system that we could use to describe its physics. So I just wanted to show that there's one simple case where where we can we can write down a distribution that bridges these two descriptions. And then then in the subsequent paragraphs, I try this, I try to argue that we can generalize this beyond equilibrium."
"Unknown","01;06;39;25","01;07;07;19","And that's the that's that's the very tricky bit. And I don't claim to have shown it by any means. I'm just again, I was trying to remove obvious obstacles to this. This is being true. Awesome. So Adam, with the raised hand and then blue or if anybody else wants to go for it, in terms of weak sleep there could be some potentially biologically realistic implementations of something like that."
"Unknown","01;07;07;27","01;08;03;03","O'Reilly and has a paper on deep predictive learning where he describes a model of the sound some a cortical system doing predictive processing that's a very weak sleep wake sleep ask of a synthetic person, if you like. If he thought that was like a good like psychophysical identity mapping there. The other thing would be oh, if if we think of experience as being the ramification of experience with the mapping what happen at the level of predictions then and if the predictions are the sleep part, is there a sense that experience is always like a kind of paradox, that it's always the dream like you Wake Park is the stuff is just updating it, but the"
"Unknown","01;08;03;03","01;08;23;01","actual thing generating the experience is the dream part. That's like correct, sir. Yeah. No, yeah. So I have an unpublished paper on this too, on the representational division of labor. So people like in predictive processing literature say things like, Yeah, we experience our expectations of the world or whatever, but I'm not I'm not so clear that it's that way."
"Unknown","01;08;23;01","01;08;48;20","I don't know I guess if you think that the predictions are the carriers of the experience or the neural correlates of the experience or something, then, then that would be the case. And the weeks that cycle would do nothing. But I think it's I don't I don't see the reason to embrace that that that interpretation of of what's going on here because it's awesome no."
"Unknown","01;08;48;20","01;09;10;03","I mean, that's all I'm all about. I'm all I'm all about the idea that that we experience sort of virtual models in a way. Right. That's that's cool. I just I don't interpret that in terms of like it's just the it's just the top down driving signal that we experience, although maybe I'm not really against that either. And I can see why you'd want to say that anyway."
"Unknown","01;09;10;03","01;09;41;21","I just don't think that there's any inference from the Helmholtz machine to that, like, because I would love to look at this paper you mentioned, by the way, unlike biologically plausible versions of this, because I think there's a lot that's right. About the the reason I say it's so implausible is just that it doesn't have any role for top down modulation of bottom up signals during perception, which was by design, so that it would work quickly but that's the main limitation that concerns me cool."
"Unknown","01;09;41;22","01;09;51;00","Thank you, Alex. Stephen with the raised hand and then anyone else and also anybody watching live, you're more than welcome to write a question in the live chat. So Stephen, go for it."
"Unknown","01;09;53;06","01;10;25;06","Just to just to help me clarify. So this being a track support for analysis so the key the key point is that by going to stochastic, it is those in principle how recognition and generative densities can be used together. Is that the kind of the point that this shows just because I'm struggling, I think I'll just say I'm not so good with the formalism to exactly get it."
"Unknown","01;10;25;06","01;10;56;02","But I think the general point you're making is that you're going to stochastic algorithms, and therefore you've got this potential for the recognition and generative density, which is basically sensory and that's essentially to be reconciled and shown even a very simple case. Would that be a great region event? I think so. I think definitely that's it's it's in large part, right?"
"Unknown","01;10;56;02","01;11;40;15","So that the idea that we're dealing with a stochastic system is kind of important because, yes, I want to claim that or I want to advance the the suggestion the possibility that probabilities are encoded by probabilities. So then you could have an actual identity. Whereas if you're just encoding like if you're using like I don't know, the A scheme that's more like what coefficient talks about often where you have sort of neuronal states that are encoding the submission statistics of the distribution, then I don't think you could get an actual identity because you just you'd have a clear representation that has a certain almost convention built in of how things are represented, whereas I'm arguing"
"Unknown","01;11;40;15","01;12;16;08","for the possibility of a much more direct encoding. And that does depend on this being sarcastic but the other part of this that I forgot to mention that sort of I think maybe crystallizes the the point that I was trying to make is that if if we're at equilibrium with respect to the networks, if we're at the, the almost machines equilibrium distribution, then in that case, if you do take ah describing the physical probabilities of the system that you would use to specify the threat of dynamic properties, then you could show that in that case at least the variation of free energy and the thermodynamics energy would be the same."
"Unknown","01;12;17;20","01;12;44;15","And then the generalizing to non equilibrium of course is the hard part but that's, that's, that's more concretely what I was trying to show there yeah. Thanks. So I'm going to go to a question from the chat and then we'll go to Adam. So Cambridge breaths asks, can this model describe or map the transition between focused attention and mind wandering grateful for any elaboration?"
"Unknown","01;12;44;15","01;12;45;09","Thanks everybody."
"Unknown","01;12;48;29","01;13;24;27","Anyway, we want to take that. I, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It just maybe the dream versus, you know, sleeping versus the waking. But then even within the waking state, we have a wandering phase versus a very tightly focused phase. So there's sort of what is happening, if that reminds you of anything. I mean, I'd say if, if we're talking about this model, talking about the Helmuth machine or this, like, slight elaboration on the humans machine, then I don't think it would do anything that sophisticated just because, like, so as Adam says, there are biologically plausible ways of implementing this kind of thing."
"Unknown","01;13;24;27","01;13;49;06","But like anything is fine grained as a shift from attention to mind wandering. I think it's probably going to be left out of the model that's at this level of sort of abstraction and approximation. That's my thought. Thanks. So Adam, then blue and then anyone else with a raised hand or a question in the chat adam. Not sure I can address the mind wandering."
"Unknown","01;13;49;06","01;14;29;25","Exactly. Looks like a physical identity, but in terms of like the mountain climbing analogy, I'm wondering if it's like mind wandering is kind of like a exploratory hill climbing with a little bit of quantum tunneling or something like that. But that's a so I mean, what would you what you think actually it might loop around to the brain in an interesting sense and that there is like if we think of like lower levels of like a cortical hierarchy as doing something more like a variational inference of like continuous message passing, maybe we have like some discrete updating."
"Unknown","01;14;29;25","01;14;57;15","There are two so that seems to be like one kind of implicit representational regime. There might be a sense in which you're getting like probabilities in terms of like the track of hardness along as hierarchy corresponding to like probabilities of like a hierarchy of nested events in the world and like a deep temporal hierarchy and the detailed protocol hierarchy of like the latent causes of the world."
"Unknown","01;14;58;13","01;15;48;05","But there seems to be like potentially like as we like move inwards like another level where these get re represented into more like concentrate when you wonder like deep association cortex and like be a different game. And then when you're getting like coupling with like the hippocampus system, now it seems like you're getting something almost like like explicit syntax with like discrete semantics because like you can map like there's these pointers blowing from like the relationship among these like you can like bump attractors in hippocampal system or like these place cells, but they can be used to like contextualize the whole overall system within some sort of structured syntax and I don't know, like would"
"Unknown","01;15;48;26","01;16;16;14","do you need something like that to have the probabilities for is that what you're looking for? Or could there be more like this, like enact of hierarchy of like a hierarchical Boltzmann machine that has invested in part because there and that those are problems like yeah, both of you it would only like the re representation yeah. I don't know I think a lot about this this issue of re representation and how much, you know, if it happens and what it's doing and stuff."
"Unknown","01;16;16;14","01;16;44;20","But I think I guess I need to understand more and this is totally just my ignorance about the kind of models you're describing with the hippocampus and such. Like I tend to think of I tend to think of semantics in the brain just in terms of like vector space models. And so I'm just curious, I don't know if we could talk about it now for a bit maybe."
"Unknown","01;16;44;20","01;17;09;02","I don't know, it's up to Daniel and others, but like what is the explicit syntax in this case? It sounds something like something that that would be friendly to to what I'm trying to do. So I guess like so this explicit syntax, it's like still heavily research. There seems to be kind of like a gold rush among different companies and like you're allowed to try to figure out the system like DeepMind."
"Unknown","01;17;09;02","01;17;38;06","This is kind of like what started them was like a sabi is like making discoveries about this. But the idea would be that you have this graph structure that would be that originally would have evolved for just locations and like meet space or physical space, but then got repurposed for any kind of space. And so this gives you like structured state spaces, whether you're navigating through the world or you're navigating through like a spatial topology, right?"
"Unknown","01;17;38;06","01;18;05;29","This basically the contents would be these. And so it would be at the top of the cortical hierarchy and it would have pointers that could be unpacked in terms of like these more like modes of an active engagement or maybe like another like intermediate level pieces of consciousness where you're getting like more concentrated attractor dynamics with like potentially a quasi topographic relationship to events in the world."
"Unknown","01;18;05;29","01;18;39;16","And so the principles are they're a graph neural networks might be relevant there where basically you get this orders of magnitude greater representational efficiency by actually making the geometry of the system over which you're doing the deep learning resemble the thing that's being model. So like there's like a graph, a grid neural networks that could be used for like spatial modeling or there's like graph mesh neural networks that could be used for like a modeling of like someone's like oppose of a thing or an object."
"Unknown","01;18;40;03","01;19;04;24","And so in theory, some things like this might form at the intermediate level and these might be the ones they're most heavily coupling with. This hippocampal system, which is giving you this syntax of, say, transitions. It's like structured composition. That's, that's really kind of come in that for a minute. Yeah. And then blue, OK. Yeah. So there's a lot there."
"Unknown","01;19;04;24","01;19;22;29","That's, that's exactly along the lines of what I've been thinking about this. I've written a bit about these like conceptual sort of grid cell type things that it seems like there's a lot of evidence that's really awesome. I know like my mentor was doing some research that's related to this stuff, so that's OK, if that's what you mean, then I'm totally on board."
"Unknown","01;19;22;29","01;19;49;01","Like, I wasn't sure if you meant that or something more language, like with like discrete tokens with other parts. But I mean, that might be encompassed by this as well. But it seems like people are finding also like encoding stuff like the hierarchical structure, like the grammar of language is also encoded is found to have a correspondence with like the structure of people like this and the relationship to these bumper tractors."
"Unknown","01;19;49;18","01;20;12;00","That's amazing. Yeah. I was going to mention also, so you you gave all these examples of graph of neural networks that are sort of isomorphic with the domain that they represent. I was going to mention recursive neural networks used for language processing as well. The network topology matches the syntax tree or something like that. So that's very that's very much along the lines of where this is going."
"Unknown","01;20;13;01","01;20;45;10","Thanks, Alex. So blue and then DNA afterwards so I want to kind of loop back around to what Adam said about dreaming because he totally like took the words out of my mouth, but maybe also touch on the question that was asked by the person in chat about mental wandering. So is it possible? So so Alex, you're you know, objection to the dreaming and the physicality was that there's no evidence for top down control during the week cycle."
"Unknown","01;20;45;10","01;21;17;09","Is that correct? Is that what I heard you say? Sorry. No, I actually meant to say kind of the opposite. I meant I meant to say that the problem with the wake with the Helmholtz machine as a model is that it doesn't it doesn't model top down effects during waking perception. Right. And that's what I interpreted. So so OK, so if it doesn't if it doesn't model top down effects during the week cycle, is it possible that maybe there are like overlapping Helmholtz functions happening?"
"Unknown","01;21;17;09","01;21;41;28","Right, like so, you know, your mind wanders off or you're not paying attention and like maybe you're consolidating, like you're you've got like one set sleeping, one set waking, and there's maybe like an overlapping construct of this like wake sleep learning cycle happening like while you're out mental wandering. I'm consolidating, you know, the information from, you know, what I learned at breakfast or something like that yeah."
"Unknown","01;21;42;11","01;22;08;10","Yeah. I mean, I think there's I think there, there are like, like this model is adjacent to like many really interesting, plausible variations. Right. And slight elaboration. So like what you're talking about sounds to me like in that vein, like I saw an amazing get repository of just like Helmholtz machine variations right? Where they just they just tweak certain parameters like let's see what happens if we propagate a few steps down during the wake cycle as well, you know, things like that."
"Unknown","01;22;09;04","01;22;27;09","So I think I don't know I don't know if I fully grasp like exactly what you had in mind, but it sounds pretty good. And thanks for I mean, is that. Go ahead. Alaska oh, no. I was going to say thanks for also trying to address the comment and because I felt like I didn't wasn't able to answer it real nice."
"Unknown","01;22;27;09","01;22;50;05","And there's definitely wandering in dreams. And how is that different than the week wandering? And could that get out what the difference is between sleep and wake? And could this model maybe give us a bit of a wedge to enter into that discussion so Dean, than anyone else for the race tent? So, Alex, back to back to Analogizing."
"Unknown","01;22;50;14","01;23;12;12","So I'm reading your paper and I can read something and I go, oh, my goodness, look, there's the world's biggest nickel. And then I continue reading and then, oh, look, there's the world's largest corncob. And then I have a chance to have a conversation with you, and you're like saying to me, Well, let's bring this back into some sort of proportionality."
"Unknown","01;23;12;22","01;23;36;00","So explain to me, what is the two carat deep diamond that you were trying to allow readers of your paper to get to? Because I know it's I know I blew it out of proportion because when I first read it, it was a big deal. But maybe you can help me bring it back into some sort of scale as to what was your deep hope here."
"Unknown","01;23;36;29","01;24;08;20","You know, it's interesting. You know, I mean, I didn't I don't I also don't mean to suggest that you got it wrong or anything. I think the proportion you're finding interpretations that are consistent with what I said, you know, it's not like it's not there. But it's funny that if I'm trying to if it seems like I'm trying to put you know, to put things in proportion or ground it in any way, it's kind of funny because I feel like others are trying to are trying to do that, like, you know, relate this to embodiment and connectivism and things, much more concrete."
"Unknown","01;24;08;20","01;24;31;05","And I, I keep trying to keep it abstract. But, but anyway, the main I don't know what the hope was here, I think yeah, I'm not sure I think, I think I just really wanted to point to the passage, but it was really about this identity thesis, right? Which I'm not even sure that I agree with, by the way."
"Unknown","01;24;31;05","01;24;57;26","Like, I'm not sure that identity theory is the way to go in understanding the mind's relation of the brain. I'm kind of like not really a reductionist, but I wanted to it seemed like there was a possibility of, of articulating a quantitative version of that right? Using the tools that we've developed over the past several couple of decades that Lewis didn't have access to."
"Unknown","01;24;58;16","01;25;13;26","And I just really I just love David Lewis as a philosopher. I think he had some amazing ideas. And I, I wanted to and it just seemed to me it's not so much about that. I wanted to show anything in particular. It just seemed to me that there was a natural convergence here that that could be spelled out."
"Unknown","01;25;14;19","01;25;42;00","So that's kind of what I was trying to do. Thank you. So Steven just raised hands and then anyone else who raises their hand. And also in the last half hour or so, anyone who wants to ask a question in the live chat. So Steven, then Adam I was just so tying in a bit with what was also said by Adam around the hippocampus."
"Unknown","01;25;43;06","01;26;12;14","So you've got the place cells in the hippocampus which gives the some way to bring the environment in potentially in this semantical. I don't know how to explore those semantics, but a semantics of place, if that makes sense. So now we've got our environment, external states essentially being brought in in an attractive way. You've got action states could be the grid cells with the what lists of what's out there."
"Unknown","01;26;13;10","01;26;43;11","And the sensory states is this lower level flux that's coming into the bottom of the brain and then the generative model would be the the higher level kind of. Well, that's sort of interesting what the generative model is in all of that is. That makes sense. If, if we were to play in that, in that sense, it would it would give that way to bridge the I'm a big fan of the hippocampus."
"Unknown","01;26;44;19","01;27;13;13","That's I thought I'd love to see how it all fits in some of these pieces. But I'm just curious around it, is that kind of a role for these grids and place cells could be quite useful to do this tracked ability between higher and lower level states? Sure. Alex, if you have any thoughts there, otherwise, I'll go to a question from a chat and then yeah."
"Unknown","01;27;13;13","01;27;40;00","I mean, I guess just really briefly, it seems to me that that if we if we are using these these, these cells in this sort of we've leverage this thing that was originally meant for physical spatial navigation and we've transposed it to like conceptual spatial navigation essentially. That's really cool. I could see it being the sort of the thing that conditions expectations for the sensory motor stuff and the sort of it would just sort of define the generative model."
"Unknown","01;27;40;00","01;28;05;06","I guess the dynamics at that higher level would be the thing that sort of sets the, the set points for things. But I think at the moment I would say so just to the question, which is also for Adam says thanks. Adam did mention that the transition process probably involves quantum tunneling. May I ask if he thinks the same for the transition from mind meandering back to focused attention?"
"Unknown","01;28;05;22","01;28;31;14","So, Adam, feel free to take up that question as well as anything else you like to add, as anyone can raise their hand oh boy. I guess like there's a sense in which like one of the quantum tunneling events, I guess I would have a minus. So like, there'll be like these regimes of sense making where the hippocampal system will lay down a given tiling of the hippocampal system in collaboration."
"Unknown","01;28;31;14","01;29;09;25","The lateral cortex with the grid cells will lay down this tiling of some domain within which you're doing this modeling with where you can get basically the relationship among these both attractors. You can get this like structure the syntax and through the pointers a kind of semantics. And also with it's themselves having a semantics of space maybe just in the relation, but the so I guess we look at quantum tunneling like so so but then if you get enough prediction error from the overall system, this seems to trigger these resetting events where you'll break up the frame and then you'll do a new tiling and it's kind of like a re grip on the act"
"Unknown","01;29;09;25","01;29;41;05","of inference. It's like a new kind of engagement and a new set of policies that could fit within this different conceptualization of the same space you're working with. And so these events of remapping, I guess you can maybe think of them as like the quantum tunneling. It's like you're just you're not doing I don't know if this works, but it's like they're called like I'm people called like levy flights, like an animal's like foraging in a patch and then it's like, and I'll just like jump to a greater patch, which is like not getting enough."
"Unknown","01;29;41;21","01;30;00;02","And so it'd be like the kind of like imagining in this place. And here you're simulating this place, and then you're like, OK, a little bit or not quite the thing. And then now you're imagining something else, then you're imagining something else. I guess you can think of those as like clock and tumbling. Like you're not just like working within one regime of simulation, just fixing that thing."
"Unknown","01;30;00;10","01;30;33;28","You're moving from here to here to here. But the question I had raised my hand was, so there's a sense in which you might think of like predictive coding style models of cortex. And it was like more complicated than predictive coding, but there's a sense in which something like that is probably true, because if you do a primarily suppressive regime, you end up inducing Spark City and if the events that are in the worlds are clocking slower than your internal updates, you come out ahead in terms like that."
"Unknown","01;30;34;06","01;31;16;02","I mean, that's why they did it for video coding. It's just more efficient. And so I'm wondering, is that enough to give like a psychophysical identity mapping in terms of like there's a sense in which you will minimize predictive coding mechanisms so that we go with just those. They should minimize they should minimize activity yeah. Yeah. That's that's actually kind of where I'm coming from with this paper and so to a large extent, I was thinking about, yeah, predictive coding as a way of understanding neural networks."
"Unknown","01;31;16;14","01;31;39;24","So I think although this perspective can, can encompass, you know, active inference and such, I think that's sort of the core of it is that the brain is literally trying to. Yeah, to it it's varsity, as you said in this varsity, minimize activity, only pass forward signals that need to be passed forward. And that means that you're sort of quelling activity that doesn't get passed forward."
"Unknown","01;31;40;09","01;32;10;15","So I think I don't know if that's strong enough to get you an identity, but I think it's, it's consistent with the identity idea and it's I think it's a large part of the inspiration for me awesome. Steven with the raised hand and then anyone else yeah. If you could just speak to how you see that predictive coding predictive process in being more or less useful at certain times."
"Unknown","01;32;11;10","01;32;31;06","As the sort of the, the discourse and when maybe active inference is not as needed at certain times, you know, maybe thinking in applied context. But I'll just be curious yeah."
"Unknown","01;32;33;07","01;33;09;09","It seems it seems to me that if you like that, if you want a like the the main advantage of active inference, practically speaking to me, seems to be like modeling like explicitly how how policies actions are chosen like decision making, right? Based on how you expect your actions to change the way states evolve. So I think that that happens implicitly in a well trained predictive coding architecture."
"Unknown","01;33;09;25","01;33;43;09","Right. And I see I don't see any fundamental theoretical advantage to active inference there in terms of explaining how things work unlike a in principle level. But that said, it's really hard to like just train a recurrent neural network or whatever to to do what you want it to do and then interpret it states and so on. So if you have an idea of a generative model of what the agents generative model should look like, that makes much more sense to write it down a priori and try to build an active inference model than to just learn it from data."
"Unknown","01;33;44;03","01;34;09;13","So that's as close to maybe a applied setting as I could get, but I hope that sort of speaks to. Yeah, let me let me try to get another view on that from you, Alex. Where would you put active inference in relationship to supervised and unsupervised learning for those who might be less familiar with those topics? When you're talking about learning from the data versus a generative model, where does active inference fit into that?"
"Unknown","01;34;10;16","01;34;11;25","Yeah, that's a great question."
"Unknown","01;34;14;26","01;34;43;23","It's a bit it's a bit tricky because there's this issue of preference learning that's kind of not settled in the like as far as how how much of the feature of of real biological agents of learning do we think that is? But like so to me, the most natural way of thinking of of unsupervised learning happening in active inference is that you've got sort of a you've got a phenotype right?"
"Unknown","01;34;43;23","01;35;11;12","So some aspects of which are going to be immutable over relevant time scales, but some aspects of which will change, right? So we're talking about synaptic weights. You could think of that as an extended part of your phenotype, and that will change over time scales with perceptual learning and, and during the life organisms, lifetime and such so like that that is I think is neatly you can categorize as a form of unsupervised learning."
"Unknown","01;35;12;15","01;35;43;04","But that's also not really again, it's not it's not there are people who are active infants sort of practitioners who don't really think that preference learning is a thing that happens or yeah, it's not clear what role it plays. But, but, but overall, I mean, well, there's also there's also got to be a role for something like supervised learning."
"Unknown","01;35;44;01","01;36;12;01","It seems to me that the closest thing that we have to that in real systems is, is like a reinforcement in a way. So like and that's certainly not to play a role that's complimentary to uncover as learning. But I think I don't know this the sensors kind of shit. I'm sorry. It's I'm happy to, to to take it up more."
"Unknown","01;36;12;01","01;36;42;20","I'm just not sure what like I don't know how to, how to how to tease apart the the, the parts of active inference that should be understood in terms of unsupervised learning versus just like learning in general. And how much of it I suspect a lot of learning in general is got to be unsupervised. And I think active inference is sort of naturally interpreted predictive coding certainly is an unsupervised learning paradigm."
"Unknown","01;36;42;20","01;37;12;20","And to the extent that active inference reduces to that, it is too great thank you. And these are definitely all topics we're always trying to think clearer about and communicate clearer about. So Stephen. And then I think this is a useful conversation. I know it's a bit of it's put you on the spot a little bit, but I think as a group it's quite useful this question of when a generative model comes into play."
"Unknown","01;37;13;00","01;37;49;28","So with reinforcement learning, I suppose that there's a generative model in relation to like an induction, an inductive reasoning in terms of the goal, like you're trying to narrow the gap between the target, that you're reinforcing the rewards and reducing the gap, whereas there's this adaptive potential in active inference too. And I wonder whether in the, in the population or the population of the brain's attention, I'm sort of wondering if place cells and sort of more granular parts of the lower levels of the neocortex."
"Unknown","01;37;49;28","01;38;23;14","So I'm not sure if that's the right term are basically exactly of more unsupervised, very unsupervised, very active kind of potentially ways of engaging. And then these grid cells as they get more populated with what things are becoming kind of more top down, maybe more, let's go back into say a more reinforcement learning or supervised learning is like and then you don't forage as much, so to speak."
"Unknown","01;38;23;14","01;38;49;24","You just go straight to the point which probably I should do now and let someone else take over this thing. Stephen, Alex, if you want to add something, otherwise we'll go to Adam yeah. No, just so I mean, that kind of makes sense to me. I think I think you need I think you need supervised learning for representation, learning of whatever isn't innate, right?"
"Unknown","01;38;50;01","01;39;26;14","And then once you have that framework, then, then you can start to think about like reward, like meaningful, you know, interpretations of sensory stimuli that you can associate with reward. So that's all I'll say for now. Cool. Adam a quick comment, the question of a quick comment on what Steven said. I mean, interestingly about the hippocampal system, is there does seem to be like this, like very contrastive thing to it in terms of like comparing between current states and then imagine states and like different like duty cycles of theta."
"Unknown","01;39;26;23","01;39;50;06","You'll be seeing there seems to be this comparison operation going on. So it could be very much like this higher level, highest level supervisor here. And this like matryoshka dolls of like quasi homunculus are things that we're thinking of. But the question I was wondering, there are people who don't believe preference learning is a thing. Oh, I shouldn't, I shouldn't put anyone on the spot."
"Unknown","01;39;50;12","01;40;09;21","It's not that it's necessarily that they believe it's the thing. It's that it's not clear that we need to invoke it to explain behavior or behavioral things and at least in many cases. So I feel like I'm going to I'm going to be speaking for for people who are colleagues of mine who I don't want to I don't want to misrepresent their views, so I'll shut up about it."
"Unknown","01;40;09;21","01;40;37;16","But there's definitely controversy about the extent to which it happens, I suppose. I mean, I'm wondering, I guess, like to what it's like. So like there are things like like metal learning principles where like you have like if you're figuring out like new ways of approaching policies. And so you're like realizing goals and you're building up these like policies to like an exploratory fashion as part of your phenotypic plasticity."
"Unknown","01;40;38;02","01;41;00;21","And but I guess there is a sense in which like if we're like for subscribing to the free energy principle, you can only prefer one thing and that thing never changes and everything else is just instrumental it just it could just only prefer to be basically Agent Smith for the entire world. You could like my iPad or me, me, me, right?"
"Unknown","01;41;01;27","01;41;29;03","But, you know, ultimately this should be like we, we, we in terms of like evolutionary favorable equilibria. But it seems like I guess there is a sense in which that never changes. Yeah. I mean, just to say one thing, to like to try to defend the people that I have been talking about when I say preference is controversial, preference learning, I mean, there's clearly something that that looks like preference learning, right?"
"Unknown","01;41;29;03","01;41;53;16","It's just a question of whether you're really learning preferences or you're just learning new associations with, with the things that you prefer. And those two processes are conceptually distinct. They might be dissimilar results, but yeah, point erasing is interesting that is that really your preferences like you literally your phenotype. So well the inclusive you. Yeah, that's exactly where I was going to go."
"Unknown","01;41;53;26","01;42;30;24","Could there not be a cultural scaffolding that's developed over ecological and evolutionary time that values diversity of perspective? And so yes, it is true that at different scales, some type of active inference could be happening. But I don't think that Agent Smith would be the only attractor at the bottom of that bull. It'd be more like a maybe a plate with a lot of different levels, a lot of different kinds of food that could be converged upon why would it have to be converging on one specific, especially Hollywood represented version of what efficiency is just a thought."
"Unknown","01;42;31;13","01;42;59;15","But yeah, I don't think Agent Smith would win like and villains usually lose, you know, Steven, that well, this this could be though when you get into that non equilibrium equilibrium dynamics is like once you get a dictator who establishes an equilibrium, that's an energy equilibrium, which is that's going to be more powerful than the more subtle organic non the equilibrium states."
"Unknown","01;42;59;15","01;43;27;19","It just dominates times. And if there is bathed in equivalence in some near or distant future between actual energy usage and governance, for example, some sort of crypto system with energy and voting and information and finances all being mixed together, it'll be an enormous nexus of power and maybe we'll be able to use these kinds of frameworks to describe them."
"Unknown","01;43;28;05","01;44;01;19","Stephen And also going the other way then, if you this is my belief, this is without it. I strongly believe that it's a creates community engagement in meaningful ways. You have to create the container for those more subtle non equilibrium states to have a chance to breathe this this woman Arianne Landscape she's a she's a theater director in France she talks about don't crush the butterfly."
"Unknown","01;44;02;00","01;44;28;26","She'll tell the actors don't crush the butterfly. The butterfly is like the idea so don't grab hold of it because you will crush it. So it's quite a nice metaphor. You have to hold it lightly and allow it to and there's this there's a certain because equilibrium dynamics or somebody comes in and basically start shouting at people always over dominate someone is trying to do some let's all come together and find each other's plurality."
"Unknown","01;44;29;04","01;44;53;14","So anyway, that's that sort of dynamic. So it ties in with what you're saying. Oh, so I flipped to 49 where we have our usual set of just closing discussions. So in these last 10 minutes we'll just be remarking on what we thought was interesting or important from the conversation. What would we like to pursue next in terms of our own work or."
"Unknown","01;44;53;14","01;45;17;08","Alex, in terms of your research, I'm sure we're also all curious as well about how you apply these ideas in terms of your, you know, whatever Nonproprietary applications you think that this bears on. If none, then that's its own interesting claim. Or maybe there is something that this helps us do in terms of practice what are the next steps here?"
"Unknown","01;45;17;15","01;45;48;07","Maybe Alex first and then anyone else can give a thought. Sure. So I mean, I could address these questions on the slide or. Yeah, let's, let's yeah. Let's hear your question, your answers to these questions on this slide. So and this also speaks to what you just asked. But I think really I think that this is just a way of thinking about things that the main thing I think it enables is just allowing you to to infer from what you know about cognition or the cognitive status of some system, including yourself to physical states."
"Unknown","01;45;48;07","01;46;13;13","Right. If it's true, then then for example, yeah, you can say, well, I'm depressed. There's not a lot going on. You know, I'm I'm I'm ruminating a lot. You can infer that there's something physically happening that's mirrors that process. And you can take either a physical or a psychological approach to solving any problem in your body. Right. In theory."
"Unknown","01;46;13;21","01;46;40;14","Now, there's a lot of working out to be done of how that would work in specific cases. But that's the kind of like basically just sort of smoothing the path for inference from physical to psychological states, I think is is the main thing that I think is practical about the practical important about this. And I'm so curious about how to spell that out for specific types of states like like depression, desires, things like that."
"Unknown","01;46;40;25","01;46;45;10","And I'm also curious about whether any of it is true at all or whether it's just complete nonsense."
"Unknown","01;46;47;19","01;47;09;04","Big questions, Adam, and then anyone else who wants to give it any thought or address. One of the questions on the slide, it is complete nonsense. I'm not sure what would make sense. I'm not even sure what that what sense would mean later. I will really want to talk to you about like the degrees of freedom and like volition issue and like different ways that could play out."
"Unknown","01;47;09;04","01;47;28;24","And also I want to drag you into consciousness because you are precise, my friend, and you're helping me think better. So cool. Thanks. I'm happy to cool if anyone else has a thought. Otherwise we can sort of look back up. Yeah, Stephen, go for it."
"Unknown","01;47;31;13","01;47;59;22","Yeah. Just to say thank you for bringing the so this foundational build up into the thermodynamics and I'll be interested to it maybe sort of see if there's any I, I think physical chemistry is so I've got some background, but I'm curious to see if there's any ways to bring in some elements of sort of gives free energy and into some of this stuff."
"Unknown","01;47;59;22","01;48;26;27","I'll be glad to chat about that time Yabulu so when you guys are done talking about degrees of freedom and agency, you have to come back to the chair because I want to hear all about this. I have some thoughts that have been cooking about agency related to active and friends and other ideas also. Cool. And maybe, Dean, I'd like to ask where does the dot to get us?"
"Unknown","01;48;26;27","01;48;47;05","What do we do at the end of the dot to we took that step to the dot zero with yourself and Blue and I and then we take the dot one and two steps ideally with author especially when it's an awesome author like Alex who's engaged with the material before the dot one and between the two. What's our next step, you know on that staircase?"
"Unknown","01;48;47;05","01;49;16;12","What do we do after the dot two? How do we make the best of this? Well, this is a sample of one. So that for me, it's so how do you remain stable and dynamic at the same time? How do you move through these gradients, whether it's ascending or descending and also keep in the front of your mind how you're going to keep your grip if you're ascending or maintain your balance when you're descending."
"Unknown","01;49;16;28","01;49;41;22","And for me, that's what Alex's paper essentially pointed out. There is there's a physical piece to that and there's a statistical piece to that. And I don't want to become a statistic of another bull person who falls down the stairs. So how do I pull all of that together and have it make sense, especially if I don't want to give somebody a training exercise."
"Unknown","01;49;42;03","01;50;14;27","If I want them to be able to model how to get down that descent or up that ascent, and I can't give them a map. So what do I what do I give them? What do I replace that with? That's what Alex's paper gave to me. Gave me a little bit of confidence. Right. Awesome. One more staircase thought and coming back as well to the up and downhill so when you're going up the staircase, you grab on to a certain spot on the rail and then that helps you ratchet up."
"Unknown","01;50;15;17","01;50;33;27","And then when you're going down the staircase, you're unlikely to grab on tight to a rail. You kind of want to loosely have your hand sliding down the rails so that you can ratchet if you needed to and stabilize. But if you ratchet while you're going down, then it's going to prevent you from continuing this sort of natural descent."
"Unknown","01;50;34;11","01;51;04;14","So it just makes me think about different modes and understanding, especially because as we talked about with the mountain climber, it's like going up and downhill in their own way. If the top is your goal they're like both going downhill. So when in our process do we want to grip the rail lightly? Just like Stephen said, not crushed the butterfly or just slide along and just go with the flow knowing that we can stabilize when we need to and when do we really want to grip and ratchet?"
"Unknown","01;51;04;16","01;51;29;10","Because we're working against one energy gradient, but we're working towards our goal is when we do that. So I hope all these mixed metaphors come together for the listeners and enjoyable way. And Alex, we really appreciate your engagement with active fly up here and everybody else. Awesome conversations. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Dean, Daniel, Stephen, Adam, people who were here last week."
"Unknown","01;51;29;10","01;51;46;22","Also, I'm happy to be put on the spot and bonuses of service to people. I think it's been a really interesting discussion and thanks for it. Thanks for having me. Thanks for all that. You do. Great. Well, everyone is always welcome and we'll see you all in another stream by."
