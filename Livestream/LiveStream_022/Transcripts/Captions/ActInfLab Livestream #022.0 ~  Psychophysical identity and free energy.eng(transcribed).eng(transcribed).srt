00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,600
hello

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,719
and welcome everyone to actin flab this

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,719
is actin flab live stream

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,400
number palindromic 22.0 it's may 13th

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,920
2021 and this should be a really fun

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
discussion just to introduce ourselves

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,240
at the beginning i'm daniel i'm a

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
postdoctoral researcher

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,599
in california and i am joined by

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
oh i'm dean i'm from calgary i'm retired

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
and uh i'm i'm kind of new to this

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
active inference thing but i'm

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
trying to keep up i'm blue knight i'm an

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
independent research consultant based

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
out of new mexico

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
nice so thanks to both of you so much

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,559
for helping a lot on the slides and

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,640
giving insights and we're all going to

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,719
be sort of working through this together

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,320
because there's a lot of big ideas that

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,120
are going to come up

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
in this discussion and then we're going

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,320
to have the next two weeks

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
with alex kiefer the author and other

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,600
participants

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
on the dot one and dot two streams so

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
we're just gonna be surfacing

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
probably more questions than answers

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,119
today

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
welcome to actinflab we are a

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
participatory online lab

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
that is communicating learning and

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
practicing applied active inference

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
you can find more information at these

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
links this is a recorded in an archived

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
live stream so please provide us with

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
feedback so that we can improve on our

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
work

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
all backgrounds and perspectives are

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
welcome here and we'll be following good

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
live stream etiquette

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,240
we're preparing and setting the context

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
for the discussions on may 18th

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
and may 25th 2021 where

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
we'll be discussing the paper

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,079
psychophysical identity and free energy

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,000
which is a paper in 2020 by alex keefer

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
and just like the other dot zeros this

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
is a context and a background and just

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
an initial stab

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
it's not a review paper it's not

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
authoritative this is

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
us unpacking and exploring as we read

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
the paper

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,200
in preparation for the group discussions

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,080
and similar

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
to some of the other dot zeros we're

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,760
going to start out with

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
in the author's own words what are the

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
aims and claims

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
as well as abstract and roadmap and then

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
we're going to ask some big questions

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
we're going to talk about why it matters

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
which is hopefully a discussion that

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
includes everyone

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
and then we're going to meander through

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
some quotes from the paper

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
some formalisms some related reading

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
just a few ideas that we

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
actually brought in during our learning

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,599
process

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
to help connect the dots because the

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,879
paper is really like the tip of an

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,680
iceberg

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
and there's a long history of

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
information and thermodynamics

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
and that's even before you get to

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
everything with the free energy

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,879
principle

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,640
so we hope that this will be a

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
educational experience whether you're

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
familiar with active inference and just

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
learning about thermo

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
or vice versa or not familiar with

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,879
either

86
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
any overarching thoughts that either of

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,239
you would like to bring up before we

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,200
jump in

89
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,319
nope all right so

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
i'll read the first aim of the paper and

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,599
then either of you would be

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
welcome to give a thought the target

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
thesis of the paper

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
is the claim that biological systems

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
whose internal states come to encode

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
statistical models

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,120
as a result of spontaneous

98
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,920
self-organization in response to

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
environmental pressures

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
learn and make use of these models by

101
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
minimizing their physical free energies

102
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,440
the identity thesis which is that yellow

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
highlighted section

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
does not specify precisely which

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,159
approach to variational

106
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
inference is thereby implemented or the

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
minimum value the variational free

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
energy must take

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,480
it may be there may be for example that

110
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,239
biological systems run an algorithm

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
closer to contrast of divergence than

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
simulated annealing

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
so a lot of terms maybe first time

114
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
hearing it or not but what's something

115
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,000
that

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
draws either of you or made you curious

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,840
to read about the paper

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
well for me it was it was contrasted

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
with a contrastive piece it was

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
the idea that in order for this any

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
any kind of a modeling effort to work

122
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
you can't start out by knowing you have

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,238
to kind of

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,560
have a bit of a fuzzy idea before

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
there's anything that's edgy

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
cool and the sec blue

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
yeah so the second piece of the aims and

128
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
claims here and

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
very timely what is exciting about an

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
identity thesis in 2020 and we also hope

131
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,919
in 2021

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
and probably beyond is not so much its

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,160
opposition to cartesian dualism because

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,919
many people are that way today

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,960
but what does make it exciting well one

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
the fact the connection between mind and

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
body is drawn at the level of physics

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
undercutting even neuroscience as a

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,400
reduction base

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
so strength for some weakness for others

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
probably two

142
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
that the reasons for which and the

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
precise way in which

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
identity is realized can be discerned at

145
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
least in broad strokes on the basis of

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
current science

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
and three that the theory is accordingly

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
expressed in quantitative

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
terms so this is not your

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,400
run-of-the-mill anti-cartesian dualism

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
this is that 20 20 flavor and it has

152
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,919
more science now

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
so this for me was really awesome i mean

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
i am always looking for

155
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,560
um the expansion of the mind

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
brain duality to incorporate the body

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
um because i think that it's been

158
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,720
overlooked for

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
quite a long time and it's it's nice to

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,919
see that incorporation in this thesis

161
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
cool we'll definitely be able to return

162
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
to that

163
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,680
all right so let's turn to the abstract

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
it's three sentences long would either

165
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
of you like to read it

166
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
i can an approach to implementing

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
variational bayesian inference

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
in biological systems is considered

169
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
under which the thermodynamic

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
free energy of a system directly encodes

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,400
its variation of free energy uh

172
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
in the case of the brain this assumption

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,680
i like that

174
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
places constraints on the neuronal

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
encoding regenerative

176
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
and recognition densities in particular

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
requiring a stochastic

178
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,800
population code and some people may know

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,919
what that means but

180
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
i'm sure we'll parse that in a minute

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,840
and the resulting relationship between

182
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,080
thermodynamic

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
and variational free energies is

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
prefigured in mind brain identity

185
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,400
theses in philosophy and

186
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
in the gestalt hypothesis of

187
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
psychophysical isomorphism

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
and i didn't know anything about gestalt

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
before i read this paper

190
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,840
yep this paper it's like relating the

191
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,039
relations

192
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
because the little kernel down there at

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
the root is

194
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
mind brain identity theses and we'll

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
return to this but that's the

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
relationship between

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
mind and brain between the physical and

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,639
the mental

199
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
and then how is that as a kernel

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,319
the mind-brained identity thesis related

201
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,120
to

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
on one hand qualitative areas like the

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
gestalt theorizing which we'll talk

204
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,080
about

205
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
and then on the other hand more

206
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
quantitative areas

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
like the formalisms related to

208
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,759
information dynamics and thermodynamics

209
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,880
let's go to the roadmap so the roadmap

210
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
it's nice because first off there's only

211
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
a few stops on the roadmap

212
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
but there's a lot of freeway between

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,479
each stop

214
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,440
on the right are the sections that were

215
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,160
in the paper

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
and on the left is how alex wrote out in

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
a narrative way

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
the road map so we kind of have the turn

219
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,560
by turn on the right side

220
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
and then we have a little bit of the

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,440
expert giving you a guide book on

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
the left and it starts with an

223
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
introduction and goes straight to

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
formal equivalences between what well

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
between free energy

226
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
and a lot of other things a transparent

227
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
code a little bit of an oxymoron

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
there i thought codes were supposed to

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,240
be oblique

230
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
but what is a transparent code and

231
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,840
eventually how does it

232
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,800
lead to this free energy identity thesis

233
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
being proposed in 3.2

234
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,879
and then discussed more in section 4.

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
then there's a conclusion so it's a

236
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
pretty dense paper and what

237
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
did anyone think about just the road map

238
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,240
or just getting from a to z

239
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,880
can i speak to that for a sec please

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,440
yeah

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
so the first reading of this when i saw

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
transparent code i wondered about that

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,959
as well

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,160
um a lot because i didn't even see it as

245
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
oxymoronic i just wanted to know

246
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,519
how that was going to get unpacked

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,360
and then the other thing i found really

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
interesting on first reading

249
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
and and both of those sections three and

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
four

251
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
changed by the time i read through the

252
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
paper a third time

253
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,959
but then the whole idea of isomorphism

254
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
to identity

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
um i came around to the idea that i

256
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,680
think

257
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
i think he was talking a little bit

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,959
about the ability to be an identifier

259
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
as one of those measures of the sort of

260
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,440
quantitative measure

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
of what an identity could look like he

262
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,519
doesn't really get into he still

263
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
throws possible in there quite often in

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
the paper which i think is really

265
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
a good thing to do because he doesn't

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
try to

267
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
doesn't try to uh bring it down to

268
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
absolutes which i think is

269
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
is smart given as you said the density

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
of the

271
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
the stuff he's trying to look at

272
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
cool blue anything otherwise we'll go to

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,800
the

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,240
big questions so um other than

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
it was a really pretty rocky road to get

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
from a to z

277
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
um and it's uh you know i i

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
just kind of had no idea really where

279
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
this was going so it was nice to see it

280
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
evolve um as it unfolded i just always

281
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,760
keep in mind

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
the paper's finite i will get to the end

283
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
if i just crunch line by line

284
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
and somebody who knows way more than me

285
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
on this topic

286
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,399
thought way more than me on the paper so

287
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,200
let's just

288
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
trust the author not in every single

289
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
claim but at least in the structure

290
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,480
and go from there well why does it

291
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,279
matter

292
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
why are we spending our regime of

293
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
attention

294
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
reading this paper clearly multiple

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
times each

296
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
and digesting it and turning it around

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
and having discussions on a chat forum

298
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
what is bringing us to the table from

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
very different backgrounds and hopefully

300
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
you as well

301
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
to think about and be curious about this

302
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,120
paper

303
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
um the three things we wrote down here

304
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
and then either of you feel free to

305
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
unpack one or any

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
why does it matter well continuing

307
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
existence depends on efficient energy

308
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
use

309
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
it's important to understand what life

310
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,760
is as well as how we model it

311
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,519
and it's interesting to think about

312
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,600
information identity

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,880
and physics what brought any of you to

314
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
the table

315
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
well so just to comment on um the

316
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
distinction between life and how we

317
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
model it i mean i think

318
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
this is very relevant to the discussions

319
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
that we've been having on realism and

320
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
instrumentalism

321
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
and really a fundamental way to

322
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
clarify that distinction i think which

323
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
was nice

324
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
cool and the big questions the paper

325
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
which are sort of

326
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
a little bit drawing from quotes from

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
alex other times us

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
linking the questions together one is

329
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
how might models of psychology

330
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
action and perception such as gestalt

331
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
but basically just

332
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
psychological theories that might have

333
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,279
no math

334
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,360
involved at the first pass how could

335
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
those

336
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,760
math-free ideas be connected to formal

337
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
equations

338
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
potentially those related to certain

339
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,639
kinds of statistical inference

340
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,760
so how are we going to connect

341
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,839
psychology to equations

342
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
big question two after realizing some of

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
these resonances

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
between certain types of statistical

345
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,160
inference

346
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
and information and thermodynamics as

347
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
well as potentially

348
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,680
mind and the brain is there any way to

349
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,760
bring that all together you know we have

350
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
apples and oranges but maybe we can make

351
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
a still life that has apples and oranges

352
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,279
and they're each in their own place and

353
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
it kind of makes sense

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
and then the third point here is the

355
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
biggest question perhaps which is

356
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,680
where does identity come from or what is

357
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,959
identity

358
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
how would we measure that or

359
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
characterize it or determine it

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,560
and i think um one hint

361
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,279
perhaps from dean was to start with

362
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
identity formation

363
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,480
uh what it what it is not so

364
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
then there was a quote there about

365
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
comparing with uh

366
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
neuronal networks and computers

367
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
any other thoughts here before we jump

368
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
into keywords so

369
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
this quote like the the difference

370
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
between living systems and computers i

371
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,000
think like

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
it would have been nice to see that up

373
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
front uh i

374
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
i kind of had no idea where the paper

375
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,560
was

376
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
going and like that it was gonna come to

377
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
this like really

378
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
um solid kernel of meaning

379
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
right and and so it would have been nice

380
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
to have some hint of that like

381
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
foreshadowing maybe like an introduction

382
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
or the abstract but i was like

383
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
had no idea where this was going and

384
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
actually pleasantly surprised like

385
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
wrapping a gift wrapped in

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
you know 10 different boxes at the end

387
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
it went better than expected

388
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,560
you know in active inference what could

389
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
we want other than that

390
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
but it does say that it provides a

391
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
criterion for distinguishing minds from

392
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
relatively crude simulations

393
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,560
like blue's alive and was just speaking

394
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
but if it was just the voice being

395
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
played from a speaker

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
is that going to be counted as alive

397
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,959
because it's making noise as well

398
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
well if not we want something richer

399
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,639
than just making noise what is that

400
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,600
going to be

401
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
how are we going to get there we're

402
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
going to start with some of the keywords

403
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
and just like there was only three

404
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
sentences in the abstract and in the

405
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
final paragraph

406
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
there was only three given keywords and

407
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,639
so

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
rather than do a keyword driven intro

409
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,000
and then

410
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
walk through the paper we're gonna kind

411
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
of do a little bit of both

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
we're gonna give some background

413
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
information and some frame setting

414
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,920
on the paper and then we're going to

415
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,519
walk through the paper and where we need

416
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
to introduce a formalism

417
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
we'll just kind of unpack it there and

418
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
share resources

419
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
okay so earlier we were talking about

420
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,279
how it's kind of relating

421
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,639
different relationships and this slide a

422
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
little bit abstractly

423
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
a little bit provocatively a little bit

424
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
ambiguously

425
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,920
is relating those relationships so the

426
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,639
top

427
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,680
yeah yeah okay

428
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,560
because of the twist and i i i think

429
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,760
when i saw it i mean i

430
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,480
didn't anticipate ants which is which is

431
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
cool too

432
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
but that but the fact that there's

433
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,279
there's a twist

434
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,800
in it i actually think is

435
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
is what we're talking about it's i

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
i think i think that will i think that

437
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
will again

438
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
surface as we go deeper into today's

439
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
conversation but actually

440
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
i was like whoa very cool cool

441
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,399
so what we were trying to get at here is

442
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,040
to

443
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,440
link the topics and then see how those

444
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,720
topic linkages

445
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,519
are linked so the mind and the brain are

446
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,240
these two

447
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
nodes on top and the question is how are

448
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
the mind and the brain related

449
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
and you can check out the mind brain

450
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
identity thesis

451
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
to learn more about what a few previous

452
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
perspectives have been

453
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,079
but one can imagine there's all kinds of

454
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,600
takes they're the same thing they're

455
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
totally different they're a little bit

456
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,839
related

457
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,680
so that's how the mind and the brain are

458
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,759
linked and then

459
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,839
on the bottom we have these two nodes

460
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,959
one of them is

461
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,000
actual thermophysics so candles

462
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
actually burning balls actually rolling

463
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
to the bottom of a hill

464
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
and then on the right side we have human

465
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,440
models

466
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
resembling patterns that we see in

467
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
thermophysics

468
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
and the question of the linkage here is

469
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
how are just like how are the mind and

470
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,680
the brain related

471
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,079
how are actual thermodynamics so instead

472
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,480
of skin in the game atp in the game

473
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
actual thermo related to maybe some

474
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
equations in other domains that make us

475
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
think about information dynamics so

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,880
those are

477
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
the level one linkages first between

478
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,639
mind and brain and second between

479
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
actual thermo and models that are akin

480
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,959
to thermo

481
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
and then this next slide is a little bit

482
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,639
of a

483
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,920
multi-play but it's saying maybe by

484
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
juxtaposing these relationships

485
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,639
also with a nod to gestalt and illusions

486
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,680
with the arrow illusion maybe by us

487
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,240
as the observer juxtaposing these

488
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
relationships

489
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,439
we gain new insight and maybe fep

490
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,880
which is sort of the little ants

491
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,799
crawling all around the sides

492
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,919
maybe the fep is that permeable membrane

493
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,280
or it's the

494
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
framework that's strong enough for us to

495
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,799
build within

496
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
and sub-specify but it's also permeable

497
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
in that it allows us to be open to new

498
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
ideas coming in

499
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
and the psychophysical identity thesis

500
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,039
is kind of

501
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
smack dab in the middle it's relating

502
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,200
these relationships

503
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,120
so if there were four things that get

504
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,799
brought together i think it would be

505
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,919
these four

506
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,480
mind and brain and then actual thermo

507
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
and models of thermo

508
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
and the way to link them is to first

509
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
make the pairs and connect the pairs and

510
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
then see how those linkages are

511
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
contrasting or similar

512
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,240
danny would you say that part of this

513
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
too though is the fact that they are

514
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
parallel and apart i mean we build a

515
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
relationship

516
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,160
we've already sort of confirmed that but

517
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,559
is it

518
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,960
is it is it a connection and i'm not i'm

519
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
not saying that in a questioning way

520
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
it's just i think it's a legitimate

521
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
question i'm not sure

522
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
that the way that we quantify that

523
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,320
confirms it or not but maybe i'm

524
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
grasping at something that isn't there i

525
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
agree with that

526
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
that this relationship exists but i'm

527
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
not sure

528
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
if it's a connection but that's just me

529
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
wondering

530
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
perhaps it's reflective of the

531
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,799
instrumentalism versus realism

532
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,360
debate right like so thermo physics is

533
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,400
um a model

534
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
and the human system is like an alive

535
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
system with you know some kind of

536
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
concrete accident existential

537
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,280
purpose right so we assume yeah

538
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
it's almost like real on the left side

539
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
and then more like an instrument

540
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,600
on the right side because the brain does

541
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,080
have

542
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,799
thermodynamic constraints it generates

543
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,200
heat

544
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
it takes in glucose it's doing

545
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
metabolism if you cool it down

546
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,000
it stops so that's like a candle and

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
then

548
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
what is the mind especially if the mind

549
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
is kind of higher order

550
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,640
and reflexively making a model of itself

551
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
in an interesting way

552
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
but if the brain like a physical energy

553
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,600
consuming

554
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
object is like a candle that's this left

555
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,039
side

556
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,799
people might draw a link between those

557
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,559
two draw an edge between the brain and

558
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,240
actual thermo and we're gonna get to

559
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,919
that in just a few slides

560
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,840
and then the question is well what's the

561
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
relationship then between these

562
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
thermo-inspired models on the bottom

563
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,760
right

564
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
and the mind is it that the brain is

565
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
actually minimizing free energy or is it

566
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
that we can model it as minimizing free

567
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,600
energy

568
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,559
what is happening here let's go to the

569
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
psychophysical isomorphism

570
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,760
i'll play this video and um blue what

571
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
made you interested in this video so i i

572
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
saw the term

573
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
psychophysical isomorphism in the

574
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,360
abstract and i was like

575
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,640
what is that right it's the the uh

576
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200
gestalt hypothesis of psychophysical

577
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
isomorphism and i was like those are

578
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,600
really big words

579
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
um i just don't have the background so i

580
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,200
wanted to look up the concept

581
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,919
and it's it comes from the expression

582
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,400
that

583
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
um the properties of the mind and the

584
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
consciousness are a direct

585
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,159
consequence of the electrochemical

586
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
interactions within

587
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
the physical brain and so this um

588
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,760
this is the the five phenomenon the

589
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,799
video did it work

590
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
it's not playing on my on my end so this

591
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
five phenomenon is an example

592
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,039
of where the patterning of a stimulus

593
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
and the activity in the brain is similar

594
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
and that's why it makes this like

595
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,440
illusion of motion

596
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
cool so it's almost like we're

597
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,799
connecting the dots

598
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
but here it's shown with negative space

599
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
and that's

600
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
a entry point into thinking about

601
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
gestalt more broadly or is there

602
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
anything else you want to add on this

603
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,039
slide

604
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
okay that's it what is gestalt

605
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,120
well people live their life teaching it

606
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
so we're not going to cover it in one

607
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
slide but we can cover some of the ways

608
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
in which it was used

609
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
in the paper as well as just a few

610
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
little tidbits which kind of

611
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,360
on our active inference foragers path

612
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
were cool

613
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
so first just as a design principle on

614
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,679
the slide

615
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,720
you visually and this is a culturally

616
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,159
uh scaffolded process separate

617
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,720
for example if you're not colorblind the

618
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,280
red

619
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
shape out from the black text and so

620
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,799
it's almost like there's this

621
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,640
organization that arises when we're

622
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
viewing material

623
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,200
and that turns out to be patterns that

624
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,159
we can study

625
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,880
like reification on the left side here

626
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,919
we do see

627
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,919
quote a triangle like a white triangle

628
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
in a even though it's the negative space

629
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
of these other

630
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,280
pac-man type shapes and so gestalt is

631
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,240
this big

632
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
area of theory so check out

633
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,080
the word itself terms like figure and

634
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,640
ground

635
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
and all these related fields and what

636
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,720
are we getting at

637
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
that's bigger than all of these examples

638
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
what does reification of shapes

639
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,799
and multi-stability like illusions

640
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
have to do with this notion of

641
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
invariance

642
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
like the idea that by looking at

643
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
different angles of a shape we can

644
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
recognize that an object is invariant

645
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
even though computers often have trouble

646
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
with that so it's almost like

647
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,600
if you're working towards grasping it or

648
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
you're seeing that there's something

649
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
bigger behind these examples

650
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
that's kind of gestalt it's hinting at

651
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,559
the whole

652
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
and so it's very related to holism and

653
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
relational thinking

654
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
but we can dig one more level into

655
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,080
gestalt

656
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
and just look at how alex used it

657
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,679
and in the paper it says um

658
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,679
this work the paper that we're reading

659
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,440
and other work by carl fristen and

660
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,720
collaborators

661
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
confirms a systematic link between

662
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,960
variational free energy

663
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
even if it's your first time hearing it

664
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,480
it's all good variational free energy

665
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,080
and thermodynamic potential

666
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
energy interestingly this view is

667
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,840
presaged

668
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,919
not only by the identity theorists in

669
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,039
philosophy

670
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
but also quite precisely by the gestalt

671
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
psychologists

672
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,080
who suppose that the perceptual

673
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,600
phenomena as subjectively experienced

674
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,720
had structures isomorphic same shape

675
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,799
to their underlying physiological

676
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
correlates

677
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
and does that mean when you're looking

678
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
at a triangle that there's another

679
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,559
triangle that's the same

680
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,640
exact thing in your head well not the

681
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,559
same exact thing but maybe something

682
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:32,960
that's

683
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,200
structurally isomorphic or the same

684
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,240
shape

685
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,960
and so to unpack that and to also

686
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
evaluate the author's claim

687
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
is it really true that this area of

688
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
science that we think is super awesome

689
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
and advanced in 2021

690
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
was it really true that it was presaged

691
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
so we can go to these citations

692
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,799
like this 1935 citation and just copying

693
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,640
out the contents and doing a little

694
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,919
color coding

695
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,880
look at the titles of the sections

696
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
chapter two has to do with behavior

697
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
and sets up the problem but chapter

698
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,080
three through seven

699
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
it's about the environmental field the

700
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
field of affordances

701
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
this is what we've been talking about

702
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,760
with a lot of our different discussions

703
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,799
and then action memory learning and at

704
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,320
the end a little bit of a closing note

705
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
on even society

706
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
and personality and probably what it

707
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,559
means to be a person and an

708
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,720
individual so we are seeing a lot of

709
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,840
these terms

710
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
which should really bring us to slow

711
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
down and think about

712
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
how we can tie different knowledge

713
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
traditions and perspectives

714
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
together in the way that alex has done

715
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,520
and hopefully in a way that we can also

716
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,320
do when we come together to discuss

717
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
any thoughts on gestalt

718
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,960
okay now we're gonna switch gears

719
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,400
from the ecological field and psychology

720
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
to thinking a little bit more

721
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,440
quantitatively

722
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,039
about statistical inference and

723
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,120
metabolism

724
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
alex wrote that the argument at hand is

725
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
meant to support a slightly less

726
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
abstract isomorphism or identity

727
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,760
directly between variational and

728
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
thermodynamic free energy descriptions

729
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,760
this argument is consistent with a

730
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,279
detailed treatment of metabolic

731
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,159
efficiency

732
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,640
of variational inference given in 45

733
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,360
which is a

734
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
san gupta at all paper with carl fristen

735
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,520
in 2013

736
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,880
so for those who are interested in

737
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
active inference check out where active

738
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
inference was in 2013

739
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,320
and think about how what has happened

740
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
since then changes our understanding

741
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
but just to pull one figure from this

742
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,279
paper which is thinking about energy use

743
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,720
in nervous systems

744
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
um it's showing how the sensory

745
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
environments whatever's out there

746
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
is going to get encoded this is where

747
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
that transparent code is going to come

748
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,760
into play

749
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,799
into a format that allows

750
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,279
control gain control of the sensory

751
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,640
input as well as action

752
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
control and it has to be done in a way

753
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,559
that's thermodynamically

754
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,880
viable so you'll often hear things like

755
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
the brain processes this much

756
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,799
information or it uses that much energy

757
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
as if it were just like some sort of

758
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
desktop computer

759
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
but it's pretty clear from just a first

760
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
pass understanding

761
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
that it's not just doing what my video

762
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,720
card

763
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
is doing vision isn't just the ram

764
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
going back to the video card and back

765
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
and forth with a processor

766
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,799
so how is it that brains and cells and

767
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,720
all kinds of biological systems

768
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,120
are able to act effectively when it's

769
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
pretty clear that they're not doing it

770
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,039
like

771
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,760
our heat producing computers are doing

772
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
it

773
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,279
so this is sort of where we're looking

774
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,720
at how do biological

775
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,360
organisms do good inference on the very

776
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,000
complicated

777
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
sensory environments and represents

778
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
all of these wild stimuli in a way that

779
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
allows for effective control

780
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
of the inputs and do that without

781
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,840
overheating or requiring just a ton of

782
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,279
energy

783
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
let's go to free energy

784
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
want to start here blue or i can start

785
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
yep

786
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
free energy in the context of

787
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,080
variational bayesian inference

788
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,559
is a functional of a probability

789
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
distribution or density q

790
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
used to approximate the in practice

791
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,799
typically intractable

792
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
joint posterior distribution p of h

793
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,279
v of data v together with the unobserved

794
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
causes of those data h

795
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
under a statistical model whose

796
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,000
parameters may also be

797
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
unknown um and

798
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,559
sorry go ahead oh just that q is the one

799
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
that we can control and q is sort of our

800
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,840
guy

801
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,880
and then the one that we can't get at is

802
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,200
the

803
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,640
actual distribution p of

804
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
two different things the data which is

805
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,080
what we definitely

806
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
have so that's good but then the

807
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
unobserved causes of the data

808
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
h and sometimes h is hypotheses like

809
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,799
i hypothesize that it's raining and so

810
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
what are the data that you get well

811
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
maybe it's visual

812
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,159
or maybe it's tactile data but you're

813
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,520
going to be able to control

814
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,960
your estimate of whether it's raining q

815
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,279
and then what you're trying to get at is

816
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,039
that total distribution p

817
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,600
part of which you can get at with h and

818
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
v

819
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
so we're going to be trying to talk

820
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
about a way to bring what we can control

821
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,159
our internal generative model and align

822
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,360
that distribution through optimization

823
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,120
to really complicated distributions in

824
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,799
the world that might have many more

825
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,320
degrees of freedom or a lot more

826
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
variability than we could possibly

827
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,760
handle

828
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
and another nice quote on the bottom and

829
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,039
yellow is

830
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
free energy captures the discrepancy

831
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
between the organism's generative model

832
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
of the world and the current

833
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,880
environmental conditions

834
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
so that's kind of cool and we've seen

835
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
that come into play

836
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
in the context of the predictive

837
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,919
processing or the hierarchical

838
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
predictive processing framework which is

839
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,279
shown here from

840
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
ramstead at all answering schrodinger's

841
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,039
question it's a figure

842
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,200
that's showing how there's sort of a

843
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,279
bottom-up which is sometimes associated

844
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
with sensory input

845
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,919
and a top-down sometimes associated with

846
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,520
priors about the world

847
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
these two interacting streams and

848
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,039
they're

849
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,760
in a multi-level way so each level is

850
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
only getting passed up or down

851
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
one level and what's going up

852
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
are these sensory inputs and unaccounted

853
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,000
for

854
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,240
errors and what's coming down is

855
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
expectations

856
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
so if the bottom up is exactly what you

857
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,760
expect it's almost like the system is

858
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
resting

859
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
so in other words if the model is

860
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,240
perfect given the visual coming data

861
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
coming up

862
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,320
everything is very chill and things are

863
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,640
not

864
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,279
chill to the extent that the bottom up

865
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,320
information

866
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,600
is surprising so what is getting passed

867
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,080
up

868
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
and under the free energy principle

869
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
maybe it's free energy

870
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
but what is free energy

871
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,279
another way to look at this question

872
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,039
about the relationship between

873
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,279
the observations in the world which are

874
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,559
called data

875
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,679
in many cases and the generative model

876
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,279
of the world

877
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,159
is with uh the paper that we discussed

878
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,360
in active number six

879
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,279
tale of two densities and

880
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,159
variables and parameters they're used

881
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,440
often loosely because when you're

882
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
dealing with programs

883
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
everything's a variable everything's a

884
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,080
parameter so

885
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,760
it can be a little bit confusing to

886
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,120
which kind is which

887
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
but the data parameters are the

888
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,520
observables and the recognition model

889
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,720
in bayesian statistics is the model that

890
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,679
recognizes the data and forms hyper

891
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
parameters about the data

892
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,919
for example um the hyper parameter might

893
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
be like the location of an object

894
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
and the data might be the actual retinal

895
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,200
cells giving

896
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
raw input and so the recognition model

897
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
is going from that retinal input

898
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,679
to a hyper parameter of where's the

899
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,039
object located

900
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,519
and then that can be used in an

901
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,399
invertible

902
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,799
way with a generative model that goes

903
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,039
from okay given where it is

904
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,440
in the estimated location what kind of

905
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
data would be generated from that

906
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,919
so this is a bayesian model fitting

907
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
approach that's related to expectation

908
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,720
maximization where you take what you

909
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
have as far as data

910
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,320
and you update what you think about the

911
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
generative process of the data

912
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
and then you crank it the other way and

913
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
you ask given what we know about the

914
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,320
world

915
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,440
what kind of data might it generate and

916
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
tale of two densities

917
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
contrasted that sort of bayesian

918
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,600
approach with a lot of the theory of the

919
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,559
inactive

920
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,039
researchers who are interested in this

921
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,600
relationship between agents in the world

922
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,320
and seeing that incoming data as

923
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
analogous to perception

924
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,799
and then the outgoing um generative

925
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,279
model

926
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,840
as generative model of action so that's

927
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,640
what we discussed

928
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,840
in tale of two densities dean yeah i

929
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
wasn't there for that but i'm just going

930
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,880
to ask the two of you

931
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,159
um i really like the the diagram but one

932
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,600
of the things i was curious about is

933
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,399
i've

934
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,840
had lots of conversations with people

935
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
who have taken an activist stance or an

936
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,080
act

937
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,200
an activist perspective on things i'm

938
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,760
wondering

939
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
from from you guys perspective is this

940
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,279
ability to ask and then what happens is

941
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
it how is it fundamentally different

942
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,840
on either side of that um that that

943
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,959
diagram fundamentally different

944
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
so you're asking the ability to ask and

945
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,559
then what happens

946
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,279
so the ability to ask a counterfactual

947
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,240
yeah

948
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,679
how is it different between the

949
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
statistical basis

950
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,279
and the here i am in reality basis

951
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,799
because i've asked this question and

952
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
every time i ask it of people on either

953
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,919
side of that

954
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,200
of that diagram they kind of go on

955
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,559
i'm not really sure do you have any

956
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,120
thoughts blue

957
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,880
yeah i um you know i i think

958
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,760
that this paper kind of really tries to

959
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,159
get at it actually like getting at

960
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,679
the the what's different um you know in

961
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,200
maybe not this inactivist sense uh but i

962
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
yeah i really don't have the um the

963
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,799
background but i think

964
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,000
you know a lot of times there are

965
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,919
layers that seem like they should

966
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,919
overlap but maybe don't have a direct

967
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,919
curl it right and i think that that's

968
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,279
what's happening here and i think that

969
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,200
that's what alex tries to address in his

970
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,840
paper

971
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
in like a thermodynamic free energy

972
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,960
statistical

973
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,480
thermodynamic kind of way right

974
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,279
fair i'll give another thought so and

975
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,799
then what happens

976
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,440
in the context of bayesian statistics

977
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
it's like a

978
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
question about counterfactuals so if

979
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,679
you're asking and then what happened

980
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,200
differently with the data

981
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
well from the point of view of the hyper

982
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,240
parameters either the data would be

983
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,080
better fitting or not

984
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,679
if you ask and then what happens to the

985
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,159
hyper parameter well it might generate a

986
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,279
different kind of data

987
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
what would happen if the sun were in a

988
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
different location well the shadow would

989
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,760
be different

990
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,839
so as opposed to that sort of cut and

991
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,280
dry sense

992
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,760
of counter factual either on the data or

993
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,359
the generative side

994
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,399
in the inactive frame perhaps

995
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,879
and then what is more of an invitation

996
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,079
to play

997
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
so just at a very first pass the

998
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,320
inactivist perspective

999
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
gives more of a affordance for

1000
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
negotiating that counter factual

1001
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
as um play rather than just

1002
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,879
coercing it into a statistical crank

1003
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,079
it's like well what happens if we jam

1004
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,520
this gears like well then the wheel is

1005
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,560
going to stop turning

1006
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,639
next question but inactivism is a little

1007
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,760
bit more playful with that

1008
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,679
blue so i didn't see this

1009
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,079
in terms of counter factual i i was

1010
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,520
looking at it in terms of

1011
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
a predictive standpoint right and then

1012
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,199
what happens is

1013
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,000
in my mind a prediction and so making a

1014
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
statistical prediction versus making

1015
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
like a

1016
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
prediction on the side of the organism

1017
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,480
or from like an inactive

1018
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,560
standpoint to me like i don't know i

1019
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
mean i still think like

1020
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,240
it just you predict and then either

1021
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,599
you're right or you're wrong and then

1022
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
you update your model accordingly

1023
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,119
yeah dean yeah so

1024
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,760
because i've sort of come at this from

1025
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,480
from the

1026
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
wayfaring and the wayfinding of

1027
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
how do i orient myself to this stuff i

1028
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,760
wondered i've wondered i don't even have

1029
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
the

1030
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
confidence to sort of put this out there

1031
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
and and stand by but i've wondered if

1032
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,839
part of it is

1033
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,520
the statistical gives us a bit of an

1034
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,359
allocentric a bit of a detached

1035
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,200
kind of back to what both of you said

1036
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,400
and daniel

1037
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,640
you know there is a personal piece an

1038
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,040
egocentric part on the inaction side

1039
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
that doesn't necessarily exist

1040
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
on the allocentric side but that doesn't

1041
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
make one one or the other

1042
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,440
more or less real but i think it's

1043
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,839
whether you can look down on something

1044
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,200
and see it in that kind of a

1045
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
relationship because we're talking about

1046
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
relationship or relationships

1047
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,079
or whether you're seeing it from the

1048
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,640
ecocentric oh

1049
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
that that snowball's now going to hit me

1050
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
duck right

1051
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
um so i don't know if that's the

1052
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
explanation that that

1053
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,480
kiefer was going for here but um

1054
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
yeah i i think it's i think it's part of

1055
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,599
the conversation if we're going to

1056
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,480
quantify this

1057
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,520
so perhaps the difference here really is

1058
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
and then what happens

1059
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,520
in my model and then what happens to me

1060
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,480
very nice very nice it has to do with

1061
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
with agency and

1062
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,800
there's an eye in that inactive side

1063
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,480
there's what happens to me and what

1064
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,160
happens to my model or how would i see

1065
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,359
it differently

1066
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,560
versus given this chess board

1067
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
how would it just play out which is a

1068
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
little bit more like the impersonal

1069
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,599
bayesian

1070
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
so pretty cool and the reason why we

1071
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
showed this slide was first off to

1072
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
highlight that even when we're talking

1073
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,000
about the hard

1074
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
the soft is there and maybe even vice

1075
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
versa

1076
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,359
and also because this approximating

1077
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,640
distribution

1078
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
that the free energy is being discussed

1079
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,320
in the context of

1080
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,880
is the recognition model so that's why

1081
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,839
we're showing this

1082
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,960
mapping okay what is variational

1083
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,240
inference

1084
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,640
well it's something that i'm sure we all

1085
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
had to do a little bit of a

1086
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,440
dig to find out about and early in my

1087
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,160
digging

1088
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
last week i came across a really helpful

1089
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
pdf

1090
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,800
and i started with this quote from what

1091
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
alex wrote

1092
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,079
and then just started searching and the

1093
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,440
quote that alex wrote was

1094
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,920
that variational methods formalize

1095
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
statistical inference and learning

1096
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,839
in terms of the maximization of a lower

1097
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,920
bound on model evidence

1098
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
called the negative variational free

1099
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,599
energy he describes them

1100
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,160
as state-of-the-art approaches and also

1101
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
notes that the variational methods have

1102
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,119
a long history in

1103
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,320
unsupervised learning so cool it sounds

1104
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,599
state-of-the-art but there's a long

1105
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,400
history

1106
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,160
and maybe it's a tractable way to get at

1107
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,599
some hard problems

1108
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,040
well what is it in this pdf started

1109
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,280
pretty early on said if you haven't seen

1110
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
jensen's inequality

1111
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,280
spend 15 minutes to learn about it but

1112
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,079
again

1113
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
this person has thought about how to

1114
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,200
teach variational inference maybe it's

1115
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
worthwhile

1116
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,280
thinking about jensen's inequality and

1117
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,599
one way of phrasing jensen's inequality

1118
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,240
is a generalization of the statement

1119
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,079
that the secant line of a convex

1120
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,880
function

1121
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,359
so kind of like a chord on a circle like

1122
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,359
a cut through a circle

1123
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,119
lies above the graph of the function

1124
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,040
so it sounds like it might be a little

1125
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,920
bit obvious graphically and indeed

1126
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,720
there is a proof without words so that's

1127
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,079
just flipping to this next

1128
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,960
slide so yes it's kind of like if

1129
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
there's a bowl

1130
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,520
any slice that you take through the bowl

1131
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
it's gonna be able to have something

1132
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
roll underneath

1133
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,280
the slice that's really important

1134
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,440
and pulling a few quotes back from

1135
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
the variational inference by blay pdf

1136
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,079
what is written is that we can't

1137
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,839
minimize the kl divergence

1138
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,720
exactly maybe we'll talk more about kl

1139
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,280
later

1140
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
but we can't minimize the divergence

1141
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,440
between um

1142
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
the data we're getting in and the

1143
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,240
generative model we want to minimize our

1144
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
divergence so just we'll think about it

1145
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,040
at that level for now

1146
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,920
it's hard to minimize that directly but

1147
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,599
we can minimize a function

1148
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,320
that is equal to it up to a constant

1149
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,480
this is the evidence lower bound or the

1150
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,359
elbow

1151
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,280
so it's almost like i can't tell you

1152
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,960
where the bottom of that bowl

1153
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,160
is but if i can take a cut through the

1154
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,440
bowl

1155
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
then i know that it has to be lower than

1156
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,079
that but if i cut as low as i can to the

1157
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,280
bottom of the bowl

1158
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
maybe i'm going to be just

1159
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,880
infinitesimally cutting above the bottom

1160
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,000
so if i have a really easy way to figure

1161
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,520
out how that cut gets minimized then

1162
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,680
maybe we'll do all right maybe we don't

1163
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
need to find out the true single bottom

1164
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
because we'll just make cuts that are

1165
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
lower and lower and we'll go from there

1166
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,079
and it turns out that jensen's

1167
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,040
inequality really comes into play

1168
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,000
and also part of the trick is that

1169
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,960
there's a

1170
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,160
choice of the investigator for

1171
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,200
which functions to use and it turns out

1172
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,680
that

1173
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,599
some functions it's easy to calculate

1174
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,880
them one way

1175
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,720
but really hard to go the other way and

1176
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
there's times where you want that like

1177
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,680
when you're doing cryptography

1178
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,520
but there's other times where you want

1179
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,720
functions that are

1180
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,040
very very easy to go back and forth like

1181
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,000
as easy to go

1182
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
from from the um input to the output

1183
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,480
it maps uniquely and quickly back and so

1184
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,160
it turns out

1185
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,400
this loop thinking kind of primes the

1186
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
pump but it turns out if you choose

1187
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
mathematical functions where it's really

1188
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,880
easy to go from input to output and back

1189
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
and you combine it with this idea that

1190
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,119
you can take a slice

1191
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,240
through a curve and find

1192
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
a tractable way to estimate basically

1193
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,240
the uh lower bound on the evidence it's

1194
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,599
gonna be possible

1195
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,240
to set up some optimization problems so

1196
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,760
that we can solve them

1197
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,960
straightforwardly and so in other words

1198
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,040
highlighted here minimizing the kl

1199
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,960
divergence

1200
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,680
is the same as maximizing the elbow so

1201
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
maximizing the evidence lower bound

1202
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
means like we're pushing

1203
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,119
up the bottom bar so we're getting more

1204
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,839
and more evidence we're getting better

1205
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,000
optimization

1206
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,640
as we minimize the divergence between

1207
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,160
the data that we're getting

1208
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
and our generative model but we picked a

1209
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,359
generative model that we can play really

1210
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,160
flexibly with

1211
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
any thoughts or we'll continue on

1212
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,200
just that it goes back to solving the

1213
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,640
problem once you know the answer

1214
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,000
solving the process of solving the

1215
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,920
problem once you know the answer becomes

1216
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,680
like very constrained and simple nice

1217
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,520
and i just described this as then if

1218
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,920
then which is exactly the same thing

1219
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,599
then you have you have something that

1220
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,079
you already are aware of

1221
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,720
the if the unknown space below that line

1222
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,599
and then

1223
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,800
you resurface to a new place and and

1224
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,560
below that line on that next

1225
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
slide is what i would describe as

1226
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,200
learning's unholy triad

1227
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
the triangle under there but i'll let

1228
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
you talk about that

1229
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,800
no it's it's really interesting because

1230
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,160
um

1231
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,240
outside of the cord you know outside of

1232
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,359
that line

1233
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,319
you have no guarantees and in fact often

1234
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,839
you increase the precision of your

1235
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:38,720
guarantee

1236
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,240
within the frame at the cost

1237
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
of losing the generality beyond it

1238
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,319
doesn't make any generalizations

1239
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,040
so the metaphor that i don't know

1240
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
somebody with more math please

1241
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,520
correct or help us make this richer but

1242
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
it's kind of like

1243
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,480
variational inference is doing inference

1244
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,760
on rails

1245
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,599
so the train operator can have a really

1246
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,440
complicated generative model of the

1247
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,119
world like what time should i be home

1248
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:03,760
for dinner

1249
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,240
and what's my favorite color uh could be

1250
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,440
wild sensory input

1251
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,040
so you can have a really rich system but

1252
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
the oh the operator can tell from the

1253
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,119
local speed of the train

1254
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
that the train is going in the right

1255
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
direction and maybe even how fast it's

1256
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,119
going in the right direction

1257
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,079
given the structure of the problem go to

1258
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,680
the desired location

1259
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,440
now there's other times where you don't

1260
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,599
want to go as fast as possible but just

1261
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
taking it at a first pass going from a

1262
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,240
to b we want to structure the problem so

1263
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,680
that we're on rails

1264
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,839
we know that all we have to do no matter

1265
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,680
how much data we have in our generative

1266
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,319
model

1267
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,520
we want to have like a forward and break

1268
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,240
and so variational inference helps us

1269
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,079
structure the problem so it's more like

1270
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,440
being a train

1271
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,680
on a track with a destination in mind

1272
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,520
which is this minimization of the

1273
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,440
divergence which we will get to

1274
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
as opposed to sort of this like hill um

1275
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,640
characterizing and just mapping all the

1276
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,480
hills that's like a map maker

1277
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,400
but the train conductor is not map

1278
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,839
making they have

1279
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,520
exactly their tools at hand and then

1280
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,200
they're just going as fast as they can

1281
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,560
in the right direction and

1282
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,680
this was just a technical slide from

1283
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,359
the paper any remarks on this blue

1284
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,119
otherwise i think we could yeah okay so

1285
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,880
this is for those who um

1286
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,119
want to see the technical details read

1287
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,000
the paper

1288
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,599
but this is equation 2.1 and it relates

1289
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,880
some of these terms that we're talking

1290
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,599
about but

1291
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
we're just exploring today this was

1292
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,160
another useful

1293
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,200
blog post and it

1294
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,440
plays into the fact that the kl

1295
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,880
divergence

1296
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,960
is asymmetric so the divergence between

1297
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,400
q and p is not necessarily the same as p

1298
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,160
to q and so it's almost like there's two

1299
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,200
different um ways that we might optimize

1300
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,400
it's kind of like finding

1301
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,280
a local minim uh local maxima versus a

1302
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,680
more

1303
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,200
global maxima but q

1304
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,079
is a constrained type of distribution so

1305
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:08,800
for example

1306
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,000
here we might be picking q to be a

1307
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
gaussian so we know that q is going to

1308
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,040
be a bell curve

1309
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,200
and we're only going to be trying to

1310
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
maximize one thing about q

1311
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,119
which is its mean and its variance as

1312
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,240
well

1313
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,440
in the easy case what the author of this

1314
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,079
blog post

1315
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,599
writes as easy is just like find me

1316
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,200
the highest point in p and then

1317
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,680
place q right on top of the highest

1318
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,119
point in p

1319
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,480
so that gets you to a local

1320
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,280
max it finds a local the global maxima

1321
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,839
and it just lays down

1322
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,160
your average there

1323
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
but it turns out that there's a hard

1324
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,599
direction as well

1325
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,520
which is actually given the total

1326
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,599
distribution of p

1327
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,040
i want the best overall fitting queue

1328
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,280
and the author writes well why is this

1329
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
hard to compute

1330
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,560
well for most interesting models we

1331
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,359
can't compute a complex model

1332
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,520
for example the real world or really

1333
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,839
complicated graphs or very complicated

1334
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,280
bayesian posteriors

1335
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,800
because remember a lot of this

1336
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,400
variational inference

1337
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,319
rested on the fact that we were choosing

1338
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,839
distributions

1339
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,200
that were easily reversible however

1340
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,119
when we're optimizing functions where

1341
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,640
there isn't a really easy reversible way

1342
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,680
it's harder to do inference

1343
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,200
and they also write down here on the

1344
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,560
bottom

1345
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,599
the optimization problem is convex so

1346
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,359
curved a jensen's inequality

1347
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,960
when q is an exponential family i.e for

1348
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,000
any p

1349
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,839
looking at this bottom graph the

1350
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,839
optimization problem is easy

1351
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,400
so in other words if we pick q to be the

1352
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,040
right kind of distribution

1353
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,480
then it'll be smooth sailing no matter

1354
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
what p looks like but if we want q to be

1355
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,000
the same type of distribution as p

1356
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,040
and we don't know what kind of

1357
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
distribution p is we're kind of

1358
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,240
setting up the problem to fail however

1359
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,119
if we say hey whatever kind of problem p

1360
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:15,760
is

1361
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,800
whatever is generating p we're going to

1362
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,119
make

1363
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,079
q part of the exponential family then it

1364
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,440
becomes easy

1365
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,720
and so you can think of maximum

1366
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,800
likelihood estimation as

1367
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,400
a method which minimizes the kl

1368
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,319
divergence based upon sampling p

1369
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,160
but in this case p is the true data

1370
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,920
distribution rather than

1371
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,000
a model of the generating function dean

1372
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
yeah it was interesting because when i

1373
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,240
first looked at that i wondered

1374
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,760
is this is this a good way of

1375
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,800
quantifying the difference between the

1376
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,160
guy in the train who's looking at the

1377
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,440
world through deontological eyes and the

1378
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,280
another trained conductor who's looking

1379
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,160
at it to utilitarianize

1380
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,319
because that that actually exists in

1381
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,079
those those graphs

1382
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,280
it's kind of interesting

1383
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,599
i'm thinking of who who those different

1384
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,119
kinds of people would be or what they

1385
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
might be well you know

1386
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,280
yeah which one is if i'm gonna run over

1387
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,520
somebody on the tracks do i run over

1388
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,000
uh five do i run over five people who i

1389
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,720
don't know

1390
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,000
or do i run over one person who i do

1391
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,559
versus i can't do anything that i

1392
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,680
wouldn't have

1393
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,079
something be done the equivalent to me

1394
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,440
but anyway i just think it was

1395
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,079
interesting

1396
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,920
that the qual the philosophical

1397
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,040
qualification ended up being

1398
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,599
visible in the representation of those

1399
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,319
of those

1400
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,960
graphs there

1401
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,720
cool and here is how alex

1402
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,280
framed it which is that f the free

1403
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,160
energy

1404
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,640
is useful as an optimization target so

1405
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,720
just a little reminder why are we going

1406
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,119
into all these details about statistics

1407
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,880
and about the kl divergence and the

1408
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,319
variational inference

1409
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,079
well because we're talking about

1410
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,720
variational free energy and doing

1411
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,000
optimization on variational free energy

1412
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,760
so that's why we had to pull back to

1413
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,839
asking what variational

1414
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,079
means and then when we think about where

1415
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,480
the energy comes in it will return

1416
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,119
so alex writes again that f is useful as

1417
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,119
an optimization target for several

1418
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,599
reasons that have been widely discussed

1419
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,960
and

1420
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
maybe those reasons are obvious to some

1421
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,280
or some people

1422
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,119
think that it's uh not enough of a good

1423
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,200
reason for f to be used

1424
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,839
but there are reasons to choose f as a

1425
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,119
function that you want to minimize

1426
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,640
2.2 gets at that and it even uses the q

1427
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,920
and the p

1428
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,119
so if we look at 2.2 relative to 2.1

1429
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,559
in 2.1 see how p is on top and then q is

1430
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,160
on bottom

1431
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,040
and then here q is on top and p is on

1432
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,319
bottom and there's this plus

1433
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,559
f if you want to unpack the equations

1434
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,440
please do so and help teach to us but

1435
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,480
just note that

1436
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,480
things are flipping and it's being

1437
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,079
mirrored by what we saw here

1438
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,559
where on the top one the easy one cues

1439
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,599
on top

1440
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,240
right and then on the hard one q's on

1441
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,440
the bottom

1442
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,359
so also using that phv notation

1443
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,559
and then um what

1444
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,800
does that mean so let's just say that

1445
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,839
free energy

1446
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,359
is the thing that we're going to be

1447
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,280
optimizing on

1448
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,440
and variational free energy has a

1449
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,640
certain structure

1450
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,200
that's related to variational inference

1451
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,480
that means that maybe

1452
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,160
if we're trying to minimize variational

1453
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,920
free energy that's going to be like the

1454
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,280
right optimization

1455
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,559
path okay so we're going to be doing

1456
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,800
variational free energy minimization to

1457
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,119
do

1458
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,400
model fitting where does real

1459
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,640
energy come into play where does

1460
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,559
thermodynamics come into play

1461
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,359
and it's right here as is often remarked

1462
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,520
in discussions of variational inference

1463
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,800
so eg in the statistics literature

1464
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,160
f free energy has almost precisely the

1465
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,440
form of a negative

1466
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,119
helmholtz free energy from statistical

1467
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,680
mechanics in fact that's why we call it

1468
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,760
free energy because it has a really

1469
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,359
similar form

1470
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,520
and that free energy term or the energy

1471
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,200
term let's just call it

1472
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,400
f of t um

1473
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,680
it's uh has two parts to it the first

1474
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,960
term on the right

1475
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,920
is the expectation so that's e is for

1476
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
expectation here

1477
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,760
of the energy stored in the system at a

1478
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,720
given temperature

1479
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,920
due to internal states so really

1480
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,760
complicated molecules with a lot of

1481
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,920
uh order like dna they have a lot of

1482
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,440
internal energy locked up in their

1483
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,640
structure

1484
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,520
and then the the right term ts is the

1485
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,359
temperature times the entropy

1486
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,319
so that's what the term looks like for

1487
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,280
uh

1488
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
thermodynamics and that's how you can

1489
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,559
look at whether an equation is going to

1490
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,800
be like endothermic or exothermic

1491
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
like if it creates a lot of disorder in

1492
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
the environment it can locally order

1493
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,319
some stuff but you know you can't

1494
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,079
make or lose energy and so to get

1495
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,200
to this more chemical phrasing of

1496
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,720
f from variational inference alex writes

1497
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,559
we rewrite equation 2 1

1498
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,160
using an energy term and so we get this

1499
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,839
tooth equation 2 3 which is analogous

1500
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,359
to this more statistical physics

1501
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,720
equation where we have basically vfe

1502
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,520
consists of

1503
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,240
the energy of the internal configuration

1504
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,200
minus the temperature times the entropy

1505
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,559
so part of the question is going to be

1506
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,920
okay cool it looks similar

1507
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,160
might those things be isomorphic might

1508
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,599
they be the same

1509
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,559
that's the thesis that's the question is

1510
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:48,800
it

1511
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,920
actually that way or is it just that we

1512
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,240
can

1513
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,319
think of it similarly and so this is

1514
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,480
where we got to 26

1515
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,119
bringing back the train choo choo could

1516
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,680
we take well-structured optimization

1517
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,359
problems

1518
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,559
and connect them by resonance in the

1519
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,640
structure of the equations

1520
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,960
to the ways that downhill trains

1521
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,839
navigate

1522
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,640
or burning candles or if you put a ball

1523
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,680
into a bowl

1524
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,559
it goes to the bottom every time and it

1525
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,400
only goes to the bottom

1526
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,440
so could optimization variational

1527
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,960
optimization

1528
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,440
not just be well structured not just

1529
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,880
have the gas and the break

1530
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,240
so that we know that we're going in the

1531
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,720
right direction but could we be

1532
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,680
thermodynamically pulled in the right

1533
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,040
direction

1534
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,760
that would be like the candle where the

1535
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,440
candle always burns

1536
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,160
if you think where its higher state is

1537
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,119
with a candle

1538
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,599
and then the lower energy state is it's

1539
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,040
burnt and dissipated

1540
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,280
it always happens given the activation

1541
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,400
energy

1542
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,359
and if there were an isomorphism between

1543
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,240
the structuring

1544
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,319
of the statistical problem and the

1545
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,640
actual thermodynamics in the world

1546
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,839
that would be pretty interesting

1547
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,480
so analogies are always partial i know

1548
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,680
dean's probably going to have a ton to

1549
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,520
say about analogies here

1550
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,040
but this is what is written by alex

1551
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,559
if the connection between statistical

1552
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,040
mechanics and statistical modeling by

1553
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
the brain were merely one of analogy

1554
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,720
it would be surprising why to find that

1555
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,400
all the terms in the helmholtz free

1556
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,880
energy

1557
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,559
play useful in interlocking

1558
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,599
representational roles

1559
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,760
this coincidence between physical and

1560
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,599
representational descriptions is to be

1561
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,200
expected however

1562
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,599
if free energy simply measures how much

1563
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,280
useful

1564
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,559
representational work can be done by the

1565
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,799
internal elements of a system

1566
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,920
where work has physical meaning

1567
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,839
in the remainder of section 2 i consider

1568
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,400
how the physical interpretation of each

1569
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,559
term in the helmholtz free energy

1570
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,200
can be related to a corresponding facet

1571
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,520
of the optimization process

1572
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,920
so it's like we have a dna molecule and

1573
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,839
there's the energy that's stored in the

1574
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,920
configuration of the bonds that's the

1575
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,440
internal energy

1576
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,960
and then there's the temperature

1577
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,799
dependent term

1578
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,799
which has to do with the dna staking

1579
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,079
around and moving around in the

1580
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,280
environment

1581
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,640
so now when we compare that to

1582
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,480
statistical models it's almost like the

1583
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,760
internal energy

1584
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,680
is the complexity not of the dna

1585
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,880
molecule but

1586
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,960
the complexity of the model and then

1587
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,640
that wiggle room

1588
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,359
is related to potentially the accuracy

1589
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,520
or the variability of the model

1590
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,760
but we'll see

1591
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,960
anything to add here on the candle

1592
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,200
okay just focus that the focus is on the

1593
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,400
function i think

1594
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,079
the representation as function

1595
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
yep that's really interesting so i hope

1596
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,359
alex can clarify in a lot of these math

1597
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,319
points

1598
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,200
and also on the representational work

1599
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,960
side

1600
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,440
so here's another piece that came up

1601
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,559
during

1602
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,400
preparing for this uh gibbs free energy

1603
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,280
is g and the difference between the

1604
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,040
reactants and the products of a chemical

1605
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,760
reaction

1606
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,799
is often referred to as delta g

1607
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,480
and when the delta g is significantly

1608
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,440
low like it's a downhill then if you can

1609
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,599
get over the activation energy

1610
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,680
with just thermal energy or with an

1611
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,839
enzyme lowering the barrier or whatever

1612
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,960
it will flow downhill so if the delta g

1613
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,440
is negative the reaction proceeds

1614
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,480
as surely as water flows downhill or

1615
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,319
in hill should i say because up and down

1616
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,599
or not real

1617
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,079
and so here's three different cases that

1618
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,440
are being shown

1619
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,359
so here is the downhill case where the

1620
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,960
reactants have a higher

1621
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,160
g than the products the

1622
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,440
reaction proceeds but not all the way

1623
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,200
sometimes it's functionally it proceeds

1624
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,680
to completion but actually all reactions

1625
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,839
have this k

1626
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,079
value where it's somewhere in between

1627
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,839
because at some point you'll have like

1628
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,920
99 of the product

1629
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,400
and then the backwards reaction is 50

1630
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,040
50.

1631
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,319
so just like if you have a test that's

1632
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,040
99 accurate but the disease is really

1633
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,559
rare

1634
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,160
you might do the bayesian statistics and

1635
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,920
find that actually contingent on a

1636
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,599
positive test

1637
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,119
it's actually not likely that the person

1638
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,880
has it because there's so many people

1639
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,240
who don't have it who get false

1640
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,040
positives

1641
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,960
that's the bayesian case so in the

1642
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,960
chemical case it's kind of like

1643
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,599
even if the reaction is favored 20 to 1

1644
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,000
well

1645
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,599
once it's 95 done then

1646
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,240
for every one of those that goes forward

1647
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,359
20 come back

1648
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,640
so it re-equilibrates at 95 to 5 if

1649
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,599
the overall difference is 20 to 1 and

1650
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,760
then on the right side on the top

1651
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,920
if the products have a higher delta g

1652
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,319
they have more internal energy

1653
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,480
then you need to add energy to make it

1654
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,760
happen

1655
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,359
and then on the bottom left is the

1656
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,040
special case where the reactants and the

1657
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,400
products have the same

1658
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,799
gibbs energy so for example like two

1659
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:01,680
isomers

1660
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,319
of a molecule and in that case it's like

1661
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,520
a coin flip

1662
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,559
it's as uh energetic for the reactants

1663
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,760
and the products

1664
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,680
and so it ends up just jostling back and

1665
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,160
forth and getting completely mixed

1666
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,440
so those are the little bit of the

1667
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,359
thermal intuitions

1668
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,599
that people might have heard related to

1669
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,000
kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical

1670
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,040
reactions but let's talk about

1671
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,440
inference and models what does it look

1672
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,040
like to have a model that's going

1673
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,200
downhill on an energy landscape

1674
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,000
or a mod two models that are as likely

1675
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,440
as each other so it's kind of like a

1676
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,000
coin flip

1677
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,160
between them so that's just kind of

1678
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,440
again getting at this

1679
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,240
potential um certainly helpful but

1680
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,680
potentially even

1681
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,040
physically real isomorphism between

1682
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,839
model inference and thermodynamics

1683
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,119
cool blue what could you

1684
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,880
tell us on this slide so i think these

1685
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,520
this is uh stuff that alex put in here

1686
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,359
talking about

1687
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,559
the role of internal energy and so these

1688
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,680
two equations of the helmholtz helmholtz

1689
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,200
free energy you talked about already

1690
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,240
first

1691
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,200
so where u is the internal energy the

1692
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,280
top equation is a equals u delta s

1693
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,960
and so u is the internal energy

1694
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,040
combining the kinetic and potential

1695
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:21,839
energy

1696
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,040
total in the system and then the t

1697
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,359
is the temperature and then the s is

1698
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,480
entropy and

1699
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,440
he writes an intuitive explanation of

1700
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,000
the minus

1701
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,559
ts term is that insofar as the

1702
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,920
properties of the particles in the

1703
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,359
system are uncertain

1704
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,599
their kinetic energy constitutes

1705
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,960
irregular motion

1706
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,720
so the impact on the free energy of

1707
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,200
entropy a measure of the irregularity

1708
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,680
is scaled by temperature roughly average

1709
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,599
molecular kinetic energy

1710
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,480
um i thought that was a neat explanation

1711
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,400
and then the boltzmann distribution is

1712
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,440
this bottom probability and it's the

1713
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,119
probability of

1714
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,760
a state at a given temperature in

1715
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,559
relation to

1716
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,400
the energy in a system and he says here

1717
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,640
low energies are associated with good or

1718
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,599
desired

1719
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,359
configurations of the system which are

1720
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,520
often interpretable as assigning

1721
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,319
high probability to what they represent

1722
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,640
and the analogy to physics is closer

1723
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,640
that the energy can be directly related

1724
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,720
to the probability of the internal state

1725
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,759
of the network occurring

1726
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,160
cool so how exactly are these different

1727
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,440
flavors of thermodynamics and math

1728
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,559
related

1729
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,760
alex teach us and and

1730
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,839
help us understand where other

1731
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,280
researchers can

1732
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,799
contribute how about on 30

1733
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,400
blue what was interesting to you about

1734
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,640
this i threw these in

1735
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,440
because these are both different kind of

1736
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,720
neural network

1737
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,799
setups and so like i'll start with the

1738
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:55,760
bottom one

1739
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,839
the boltzmann machine isn't really like

1740
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:58,960
practical or

1741
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,319
or used a lot um to solve problems

1742
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:02,960
because

1743
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,799
it's really takes a lot of energy as you

1744
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,079
can see like the connections in the

1745
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,119
network there's a lot

1746
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,520
it's like a fully connected network but

1747
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
they use this restricted boltzmann

1748
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,079
machine

1749
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,559
to kind of solve problems instead it's a

1750
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,440
it's a neural network architecture

1751
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,359
and it's simpler than the helmholtz

1752
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,799
machine which is above it it's just

1753
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,000
divided into

1754
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,480
the visible units in green which is like

1755
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,240
you can see the data going in

1756
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,400
and then the hidden layers which are the

1757
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,359
blue nodes

1758
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,559
in the network um and it's uh

1759
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,799
anyway it's just uses gibbs sampling to

1760
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,880
recognize and generate inputs

1761
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,480
um not like what goes on in the

1762
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,640
helmholtz which is like the

1763
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,240
there's in the helmholtz model which is

1764
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,480
the top one there's this recognition

1765
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,680
layer and a generative layer and so

1766
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,400
there's the hidden layers are behind it

1767
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,960
so

1768
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,480
when you see the visible layer it's this

1769
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,319
is the input in the recognition

1770
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,720
model and then in the generative model

1771
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,559
this is the output and so i think that

1772
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,079
it's really kind of cool that there's

1773
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,520
this recognition layer and the

1774
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,640
generative layer

1775
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,200
because it just relates um so closely to

1776
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,480
active inference and

1777
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,680
and how that's um all done and

1778
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,440
uh there can be multiple layers so you

1779
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,880
can have like a deeper

1780
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,680
um you know structure than this and also

1781
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,960
these helmholtz machines

1782
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,799
are i think alex talks about in the

1783
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,400
paper he doesn't show it

1784
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,640
um or maybe say it exclusive explicitly

1785
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,920
but the helmholtz machines

1786
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,240
literally are doing sleep wake sleep

1787
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,440
wake and so how you train

1788
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,680
training the model is that like the the

1789
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,799
generative tr

1790
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,839
or the generative traces the recognition

1791
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,079
like by definition and so it's you know

1792
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,079
constantly chasing each other

1793
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,599
versus the ultimate machine that's just

1794
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,079
all kind of kind of happening at once

1795
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,839
thanks that's really interesting also

1796
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:51,359
these names like boltzmann and gibbs

1797
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,119
it's almost like there's equations that

1798
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,799
are named after them

1799
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,920
in thermodynamics like gibbs free energy

1800
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,400
but also this is an inference machine

1801
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,760
the boltzmann machine is an inference

1802
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,559
machine

1803
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,200
and i i just looked it up uh some may

1804
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,240
find this interesting

1805
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,559
some may not but this is the wikipedia

1806
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,520
page for gibbs

1807
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,240
sampling what is gibbs sampling gibbs

1808
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,039
sampling

1809
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,000
is a markov chain monte carlo algorithm

1810
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,920
for obtaining a sequence of observations

1811
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,440
which are approximated

1812
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,599
from a specific multivariate probability

1813
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,480
distribution

1814
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,359
when direct sampling is difficult so

1815
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:26,640
that comes into play

1816
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,760
in blue and i's area of genomics or in

1817
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,839
phylogenomics where we don't have the

1818
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
generative model

1819
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,760
but we have a ton of data and part of

1820
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,039
the way that we fit

1821
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,440
bayesian models in phylogenomics is by

1822
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,359
using these sampling approaches

1823
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,599
and so it's kind of like sampling but

1824
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,760
that stochastic way that we're sampling

1825
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,720
where like you kind of

1826
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,559
go in the direction of informative

1827
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:49,760
samples but

1828
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,640
also you want to sample broadly from a

1829
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,400
distribution that you don't know the

1830
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,920
real underlying truth but you just have

1831
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,839
a ton of data

1832
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,240
that is just very interesting to see how

1833
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,119
it comes back

1834
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,240
here so thermo and info have been

1835
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,520
presaged for a long time that's what

1836
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,839
alex does an awesome job of

1837
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,280
bringing back some of the literature

1838
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,440
from

1839
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,480
okay what is temperature

1840
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,640
so there's temperature in the physical

1841
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,640
world which is related

1842
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,319
to the speed of molecules

1843
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,640
and just before we quote alex on the

1844
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,359
left just

1845
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,520
a reminder that even at a given

1846
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,720
temperature

1847
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,720
that the speed distribution of different

1848
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,880
molecules is really different

1849
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,559
because they have different masses so

1850
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,880
what's conserved at a given temperature

1851
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,079
like zero degrees celsius or something

1852
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,760
is actually an energy value per molecule

1853
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,680
and lighter molecules are moving faster

1854
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,400
than larger molecules

1855
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,240
and what alex writes is that the meaning

1856
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,920
of temperature within statistical

1857
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,640
modeling

1858
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,880
so that's what it means in physics

1859
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,640
statistical physics

1860
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,720
but in statistical modeling is

1861
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,480
illustrated in the example of simulated

1862
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,520
annealing

1863
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,200
where increasing the temperature

1864
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,720
increases the variance of the

1865
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,880
distribution over configurations of the

1866
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,920
system

1867
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,520
and lowering it collapses the

1868
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,200
distribution to a small

1869
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,359
range of states near the ground state so

1870
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,200
like when you have dna

1871
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,920
the lowest energy state is when the two

1872
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,200
strands are annealed

1873
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,920
all the way together and just resting

1874
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,280
and then when you crank up the

1875
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,319
temperature

1876
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,640
in that reaction there's more and more

1877
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,480
wiggling of the double helix and then

1878
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,960
for any given stretch of dna there's a

1879
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,079
temperature where there's so much

1880
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:34,960
wiggling

1881
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,240
that they separate and so then

1882
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,079
you cool it down and they re-anneal so

1883
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,160
that's kind of how pcr works

1884
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,000
but it also has a statistical

1885
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,200
interpretation

1886
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,240
as you turn it up everything is wiggling

1887
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:48,720
around

1888
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,839
more and then as you cool it down

1889
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,720
things converge to small ranges of

1890
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,960
states near their ground state

1891
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,240
and controlling the variance of a

1892
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,079
distribution is useful in many

1893
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,440
applications

1894
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,599
i'm sure we can all think of many times

1895
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,880
where there there's

1896
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,200
a need for looseness or tightness or

1897
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,400
flexibility

1898
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,880
to tune a given model from loose to

1899
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,839
tight

1900
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,920
but what what what does that make you

1901
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,319
think about

1902
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,440
so um i just want to talk about

1903
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,200
temperature like there's temperature in

1904
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,760
this

1905
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,160
um you know thermodynamics sense right

1906
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,839
that controls

1907
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,400
so much right about the energy of the of

1908
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,039
the

1909
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,039
particles and and all these things and i

1910
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
just read like a really

1911
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,319
interesting model and so i would have i

1912
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,079
would have added the reference um i just

1913
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,680
looked it up really quick so it's

1914
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,559
a paper called dynamics of collective

1915
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,480
action to conserve a large

1916
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,319
common pool resource it's a paper that

1917
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:45,680
just came out in

1918
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,119
scientific reports by anderson at al but

1919
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,520
in this paper they use this it's this

1920
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,400
phi metric

1921
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,039
and they use it to like talk about the

1922
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,079
temperature

1923
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,440
but it's not really like a temperature

1924
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,440
but it's just like the

1925
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,359
influence of all of the external

1926
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,640
surroundings on

1927
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,480
the behavior of the agents so i think

1928
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,240
about in in the terms of active

1929
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:06,960
inference

1930
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,520
like what like the political arena the

1931
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,599
news you know like all of these things

1932
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,400
have influence on our our perception and

1933
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,280
our action

1934
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,599
right and so so can we have like a

1935
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,480
temperature

1936
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,599
like it like in terms of um having this

1937
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:22,160
in in

1938
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,559
uh in an active inference sense you know

1939
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,359
and and they did

1940
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,920
kind of a really nice job um baking that

1941
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,559
into that

1942
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,760
agent-based model is nice cool also

1943
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,480
thinking about

1944
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,440
action it reminds me of like a golf

1945
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,319
swing or

1946
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,280
chopping a knife the low temperature

1947
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
action is the variance in the action is

1948
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,240
very low

1949
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
and so you might see that reflected by

1950
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,000
like a groove that's very

1951
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,119
entrenched but then the high variance

1952
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,799
the higher temperature action is kind of

1953
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,400
all over the place

1954
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,640
and so we can imagine that especially

1955
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,520
when we're learning

1956
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,440
we don't know where the right place to

1957
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,640
put the average

1958
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,359
is so you don't want to have a tight

1959
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:02,480
distribution too

1960
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,359
early you want to start with a very high

1961
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,079
temperature and a broad distribution

1962
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,280
and then you want to hone in maybe like

1963
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,039
there's a few ways that you might a few

1964
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,280
successful end points you might get to

1965
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,520
but ironically if you start there too

1966
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,640
tightly then you'll fail

1967
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,839
so that's kind of interesting to think

1968
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,080
about

1969
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
how about organisms that have to

1970
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,640
minimize their free energy to stay alive

1971
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,319
well alex writes that free energy

1972
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,719
minimizing has been used to explain how

1973
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,679
organisms

1974
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,439
manage to keep themselves away from

1975
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,759
thermodynamic equilibrium the ultimate

1976
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,640
equilibrium

1977
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,520
of dissipation with respect to the

1978
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,198
external environment

1979
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,640
in other words you have to maintain that

1980
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,880
non-equilibrium steady state

1981
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,960
because if you descend into total

1982
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,238
equilibrium

1983
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,359
it's equivalent to death and so

1984
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,679
using a candle analogy you know the

1985
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,960
flame is out

1986
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,238
out out flame there's a point

1987
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,520
where the system is no longer lit

1988
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,960
the flame is out and then it's not

1989
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,439
just uh that it's kind of it's like a

1990
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:10,399
zero to one

1991
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,719
with life and death even though we're

1992
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:13,679
not going to the human

1993
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,040
case or anything like that just taking

1994
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,880
it thermodynamically with a candle

1995
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,198
and then it's just like volume you can

1996
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,880
just get more and more and more

1997
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,158
dissipation of energy

1998
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,560
from a candle to a flame to just a

1999
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,238
complete inferno

2000
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,960
more and more dissipation of energy and

2001
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,319
then there's some value where you're not

2002
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,238
dissipating energy as a system

2003
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,279
you're dead well

2004
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,759
let's map that on two organisms so

2005
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,920
there's some point where the organism

2006
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,600
dies not saying there's a moment where

2007
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,679
it happens or a clean break

2008
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,279
but there is a difference between

2009
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,040
something that is no longer

2010
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,040
actively maintaining a non-equilibrium

2011
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,520
steady state versus something that isn't

2012
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,759
and here is like a dog that's sick but

2013
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:54,960
it's alive

2014
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,880
and this is like a more vital and

2015
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,239
healthy

2016
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,679
dog and so the question would be

2017
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,320
do species really minimize their free

2018
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,360
energy

2019
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,640
or do they just oh oh wait

2020
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,360
that's a little bit more of a

2021
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,920
generalization as long as the organism

2022
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,360
is maintaining it's not equilibrium

2023
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,120
steady state it's fair to say that it is

2024
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,880
acting as if it's minimizing its free

2025
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,159
energy

2026
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,719
but then the question is maybe for other

2027
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,960
levels of organization like a species

2028
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,159
do higher levels of organization

2029
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,560
actually minimize free energy in their

2030
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,440
own right

2031
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,000
or are they just more like a collection

2032
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,400
of agents that are seeking to stay alive

2033
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,320
and then the group stays alive as long

2034
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,840
as you have individuals that are staying

2035
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,560
alive

2036
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,400
thermodynamically um so

2037
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,159
i think that's partly where the mapping

2038
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,600
is going with this whole

2039
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,560
energy and information and life and

2040
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,600
death but again

2041
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,920
alex that'd be awesome spot you know

2042
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,520
what is life what is death

2043
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,840
these would be great things for you to

2044
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,040
address any thoughts or we'll continue

2045
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,840
all right so in the free energy

2046
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,440
principle and

2047
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:12,400
metaphysics section um

2048
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,480
we pulled out a few quotes related to

2049
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,280
where all of these predictive coding and

2050
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,280
free energy principle

2051
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,840
ideas come together it's a little bit

2052
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,360
rehashing so we're not going to read

2053
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,320
anything but

2054
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,560
people should check out the paper and

2055
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,480
yeah sometimes with these dense papers

2056
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,920
we end up just

2057
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,719
getting a lot on the slides just to get

2058
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,640
it out there and unpack it and there's

2059
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,920
many ways we could have probably

2060
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,600
reordered stuff or

2061
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,239
thought differently about it what about

2062
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,959
this slide blue

2063
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,159
okay

2064
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,360
just that it's the just uh yeah i if

2065
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,719
we're not going to read it we're not

2066
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,080
going to read it the paper

2067
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,040
was really good good good there let's

2068
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:57,600
consider

2069
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,280
the thought experiment that was done in

2070
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,120
the paper which is this

2071
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,960
sleeping and waking agent and so

2072
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,480
um we're going to have these an agent

2073
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,040
that has two different phases there's a

2074
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,360
wake phase of the algorithm

2075
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,800
um where the hidden caught where the

2076
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,480
activity is driven bottom up by the

2077
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,320
recognition weights so like when you're

2078
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,199
awake

2079
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,360
it's driven by the visual input coming

2080
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,239
in

2081
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,520
and then there's a sleep phase

2082
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,679
where you can imagine the opposite is

2083
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,840
true like the model updating is being

2084
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,640
driven

2085
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,600
by the generative model in the absence

2086
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,000
of

2087
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,440
being driven by stimuli and then

2088
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,400
you take those two phases of the model

2089
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,840
and combine them

2090
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,679
into this r equation

2091
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,159
so it's like you have night and day

2092
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,600
light and wake and then the agent is

2093
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,040
going to be modeling

2094
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,040
that and i think dean you had a nice

2095
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,480
take or interpretation on what this

2096
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,239
sleep wake meant

2097
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,159
what what what did this out what did

2098
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,840
this example show or where did you see

2099
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,640
it in the context of the paper

2100
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,440
well sort of going back to this being an

2101
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,320
example of this stochastic channel

2102
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,840
so i i wondered whether or not

2103
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,239
recognition is a

2104
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,000
recognition which is then

2105
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,960
consolidated is a two-way establishment

2106
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,000
of what

2107
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,920
sort of we've taken to be

2108
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,640
what we now know versus what we don't so

2109
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,520
is there

2110
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,920
two parts to this being it's a two-way

2111
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,239
establishment is there a build-up

2112
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,560
in terms of the generative model as

2113
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,320
probabilities are confirmed and

2114
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,880
is there a build in is there a way to be

2115
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,600
able to

2116
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,719
to in that i guess it would be in the

2117
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,480
sleep phase

2118
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,320
or the non-weight phase is there a way

2119
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,080
for us to be able to sort of purge the

2120
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,920
error units

2121
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,760
and then sort of discard them but again

2122
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,000
i'm i'm saying this not knowing my

2123
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,159
my negative f from my d sub k l

2124
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,000
in terms of what this actually means

2125
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,360
right but

2126
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,320
but i do like the i do like the idea

2127
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,560
that you can try to take a shot at it a

2128
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,520
guess at it

2129
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,000
and if you're completely off well fine

2130
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,960
but it's not so

2131
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,719
unreachable that you can't take a good

2132
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,360
guess at it

2133
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,360
thanks for really doing awesome on the

2134
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,199
dot zero and bringing your perspective

2135
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,800
because i totally agree with that and

2136
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,679
like

2137
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,520
i'm not even sure what the agent is

2138
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,719
modeling here

2139
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,560
it's like r of what let's find out

2140
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,280
what this agent is doing and what it

2141
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,239
means

2142
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,920
but it is playing a role in the paper

2143
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,360
which is using the model as just a

2144
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,159
minimal

2145
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,280
experiment to illustrate

2146
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,159
the identity thesis which is the claim

2147
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:58,560
that

2148
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,199
the variational free energy so doing the

2149
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,600
variational statistical inference

2150
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,960
that model fitting is going to be

2151
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,800
equal to the thermodynamic free energy

2152
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,480
of the system so definitely alex

2153
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,280
help us um understand what the model is

2154
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,480
showing here

2155
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,199
and also what maybe empirical system

2156
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,320
could we actually look at

2157
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,080
like can we collect data from a wake

2158
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,000
person or a sleeping person or

2159
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,440
another system to see if this is the

2160
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,678
case

2161
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,320
in equation 3.2 there's more unpacking

2162
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:39,040
of the f in terms of a kl divergence and

2163
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,360
then

2164
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,640
um another term if you want to learn

2165
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,120
more of the mathematical details

2166
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,719
unpack that and work through it

2167
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,159
in the discussion there

2168
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:55,520
is some uh connection to the work

2169
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,199
of lewis and others

2170
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,159
how is the bayesian brain and the

2171
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:02,880
position

2172
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,040
of lewis uh

2173
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,600
relating to folk psychology how do these

2174
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,120
terms come together

2175
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,760
section four later in section four

2176
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,360
there's some formal logic um

2177
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,400
ramsay sentences predicate logics

2178
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,480
also it'd be very interesting to learn

2179
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,440
about

2180
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,040
what is being done here because we were

2181
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
talking a lot about the mind and the

2182
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,480
brain that sounded like

2183
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,199
statistical i mean and as in

2184
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,800
philosophical and then there's

2185
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,280
things burning and thermodynamics and

2186
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,080
then

2187
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,040
here's a logical sentence that is

2188
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,800
actually yeah blue what what did you see

2189
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,080
here

2190
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,159
so i i put a lot of this these little

2191
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,679
comments into the slides because i was

2192
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,360
like what is a ramsay sentence

2193
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,199
and what are these like weird symbols

2194
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,800
like i can do regular math but like when

2195
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,159
you start to get into these like

2196
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,840
i don't know tricky symbols it baffles

2197
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,080
me always so a ramsey sentence is a

2198
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,239
formal logic reconstruction

2199
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,159
of a theoretical proposition that

2200
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,320
attempts to draw a line between science

2201
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,360
and metaphysics

2202
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,560
which i didn't know that i've never

2203
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,560
heard of these before um

2204
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,800
and so i just couldn't really figure out

2205
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,480
like and so this backwards yeah i was

2206
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,440
trying to read this

2207
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,000
like you know equal this equation here

2208
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,360
down at the bottom and so

2209
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,120
this backwards e is called the

2210
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,040
existential quantifier

2211
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,560
so like there exists uh x there exis

2212
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,920
there exists of x

2213
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,600
and then this upside down a is a

2214
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,840
universal quantifier for all

2215
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,880
so there exists an x for all y

2216
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,320
and then the t i guess is the predicate

2217
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,040
i don't know what that means so that y

2218
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,880
uh and then this is a material by

2219
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,320
conditional so i was really grateful for

2220
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,199
the triple equal

2221
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,880
unpacking because i had no idea what

2222
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,640
that meant and then the identity

2223
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,159
relationship so i couldn't even get

2224
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,840
all the way through reading this so if

2225
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,040
someone would read it to me that'd be

2226
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,560
great

2227
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,159
yep perhaps there exists x

2228
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,879
for all y

2229
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,840
and then the claim is of that or that

2230
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,640
relationship

2231
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,480
is that the predicate which it's the

2232
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,000
part of a sentence

2233
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
or a clause with a verb stating

2234
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,480
something about the object like went

2235
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:12,960
home

2236
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,679
in john went home and then just to see

2237
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,199
the three and the two

2238
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,040
like the three is saying the material by

2239
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,239
condition that's

2240
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,120
the psychophysical part it's like saying

2241
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,679
there's

2242
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,400
you know something t of y and x those

2243
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,440
are the parts that are

2244
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,320
actually materially bi-conditional and

2245
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,679
then there's an equal sign

2246
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,480
and those are the identity or let's hear

2247
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,760
it from alex read

2248
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,920
in different languages another topic

2249
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,440
that came up in this paper

2250
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,560
as well as was in 16 is

2251
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,199
what's the difference between a real

2252
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:48,080
mind

2253
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,280
brain system versus a

2254
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,560
simulated mind brain system like

2255
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,800
is every chess playing algorithm alive

2256
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,080
just because it can play chess just

2257
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,840
because people play chess

2258
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,600
or does there have to be some other

2259
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,480
aspect to the information dynamics

2260
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,520
and it's something that both this paper

2261
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,960
and again 16 with um wanja

2262
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,520
weiss uh went in two

2263
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,760
um any thoughts on real simulated

2264
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,199
i really thought this was like the crux

2265
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,640
of the paper

2266
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,040
um so so that's that's my only thought

2267
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,280
this identity thesis and the criterion

2268
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,400
for distinguishing

2269
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,920
you know a neural network versus an

2270
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,159
actual neural network in my brain right

2271
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,239
or a person with a with a neural network

2272
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:36,480
or

2273
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,919
an organism somehow

2274
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,400
cool plankton or whatever it doesn't

2275
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,080
have to be a brain but because because

2276
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,239
alex did make that um distinction in the

2277
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,000
paper awesome

2278
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,320
so just a few more last notes for those

2279
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,760
who stick around to the end

2280
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,800
and listening to the good stuff first

2281
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,000
how does the cell do more with less

2282
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,520
it's kind of like asking how does the

2283
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,520
brain do more with less

2284
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,000
from a model fitting perspective if you

2285
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,199
were to train the

2286
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,480
um computer on tracing a baseball it

2287
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,440
might use like

2288
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,639
100 hamburgers worth of energy but then

2289
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,159
you can trace the baseball

2290
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,880
for a fraction of that one centi

2291
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,239
hamburger so

2292
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,639
that's the brain doing more with less

2293
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:21,840
for model fitting

2294
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,080
how does the cell do more than less more

2295
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,800
with less in the biochemistry realm

2296
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
and this helps us get an intuition for

2297
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,719
how the brain might do more with less

2298
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,600
in the information realm and it relates

2299
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,719
to the hydrolysis

2300
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,360
or the cutting with water of atp which

2301
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,520
is a molecule with a high internal

2302
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,560
energy

2303
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,800
so you can use some of that internal

2304
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,920
energy to do

2305
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,719
other work and also release heat in

2306
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,000
other words split atp

2307
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,040
into adp and a free phosphate and extra

2308
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,600
energy

2309
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,719
free energy energy you can use and this

2310
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:55,679
is what was

2311
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,719
one of the most fascinating probably

2312
01:20:58,719 --> 01:20:59,679
facts that i learned

2313
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,880
in my biochem education exactly how much

2314
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,159
free energy is released

2315
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,400
with a hydrolysis of atp and how is that

2316
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,960
free energy used to do cellular work

2317
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,960
the calculated delta g for the

2318
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,199
hydrolysis of one mole of atp

2319
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,159
is negative 7.3 k cal per mole so if you

2320
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:16,880
just

2321
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,159
burn the candle you get negative 7.3

2322
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,440
units of energy that's under standard

2323
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,400
conditions

2324
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,960
in fact the delta g for the hydrolysis

2325
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,800
in a living cell is almost double that

2326
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,960
negative 14 k cows a mole how

2327
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,080
is it vitalism is it magic well can't

2328
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,280
rule that out

2329
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,800
but there's a lot of tricks that can be

2330
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,960
played with localizing

2331
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,280
reactions so you can have a little tiny

2332
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,800
bubble where the ph

2333
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,239
is ridiculously acidic like one proton

2334
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,440
vibrating around but it's so small that

2335
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,960
the protons local acidity is unreal

2336
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,880
and so there's all kinds of tricks that

2337
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,320
can be played with

2338
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,880
how things are combined and separated

2339
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,520
and connected to each other and related

2340
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,159
that help you get more energy out of

2341
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,639
just the hydrolysis of an atp

2342
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,840
so just think if you can get 2x

2343
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,440
on burning the candle in a cell

2344
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,840
probably you can do a lot more than 2x

2345
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,040
on the information

2346
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:23,040
in the environments is that physical

2347
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,199
is it just statistical that's the

2348
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,400
question

2349
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,480
but it certainly is happening physically

2350
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,600
with the cell so

2351
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,719
it seems like it probably could be

2352
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,520
happening in the brain as well

2353
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,840
biochemistry blue no the cell has the

2354
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,320
demon

2355
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,239
right so so you know when we were

2356
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,520
putting these slides together it's like

2357
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,440
where's maxwell's demon in here like

2358
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,360
the cell has the demon i guess i don't

2359
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,159
know um

2360
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,800
then where does active inference come

2361
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,760
into play hashtag activelab

2362
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,239
and so we searched for the term and it's

2363
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:56,880
used

2364
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,239
twice both times it's used

2365
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,800
a little bit indirectly referring to the

2366
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,679
literature

2367
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,360
on active inference and the literature

2368
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,960
on the fep

2369
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,000
and also it's related to

2370
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,600
topics we've talked about like top down

2371
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,199
priors the umvelt

2372
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,000
of the organism so it'd be super

2373
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,600
interesting to hear

2374
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,239
from alex where does active inference

2375
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,600
come into play

2376
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,600
in your agent as you had the thought

2377
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,440
experiment or

2378
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,440
just where does active inference come

2379
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,919
into play

2380
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,840
and then a key test and prediction

2381
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,080
although

2382
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,800
uh in another sort of classic three

2383
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,520
sentence

2384
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,000
paragraph alex does take it both ways

2385
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,760
which is basically to ask

2386
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,080
whether the identity thesis can be

2387
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,360
tested

2388
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,880
and uh he suggests that you could look

2389
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,639
for a stochastic

2390
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,360
code so in encoding just like we saw

2391
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,040
earlier on with that sengupa

2392
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,760
2013 paper the encoding that's going to

2393
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,480
be like

2394
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,120
the sort of trade-off between only

2395
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,639
giving a little information but making

2396
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,679
it the right info

2397
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,199
so that the model can be updated

2398
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,840
appropriately is to see if that is

2399
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,960
empirically plausible and

2400
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,679
this is an interesting philosophical

2401
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,719
point

2402
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,000
which is that the conjunction of the

2403
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,440
identity thesis with

2404
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,159
fep free energy principle is a

2405
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:23,920
falsifiable hypothesis

2406
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,480
even if the fep is not so in actin 14 15

2407
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,360
20 we talked a lot about this what is

2408
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,400
falsification

2409
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,960
and relationship with the fep and so

2410
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,600
it's almost like

2411
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,000
fep is a carrier like it is deployed

2412
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,920
in really clearly falsifiable ways

2413
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,440
yet it is more of that carrier wave

2414
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,159
that isn't directly falsifiable or i'm

2415
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:50,880
not sure

2416
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,320
where what he was getting at here but i

2417
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,080
thought that was really fascinating

2418
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,159
to think about not just oh it's a

2419
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,480
corollary that's falsifiable

2420
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
it's like we're taking the fep and

2421
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,679
another

2422
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,239
field and now that is going to be

2423
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,159
something that we can both formalize and

2424
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:07,600
falsify

2425
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,520
but here we just have falsification here

2426
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,280
we just had formalization and we had to

2427
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,000
amalgamate

2428
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,760
them in order to make something that

2429
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,719
would take the best of both worlds

2430
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,520
so let's hear from that and then this is

2431
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,440
where i said he has it both ways

2432
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,880
which is uh uh not that something is

2433
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,000
true and false but actually

2434
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,440
that the evidence is going to run

2435
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,679
backwards to us he's saying

2436
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,440
strong empirical evidence for the right

2437
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,040
type of encoding

2438
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,800
together with a formulation of cognitive

2439
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,960
dynamics in terms of that variational

2440
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,159
bayesian inference

2441
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,800
supports the case so maybe there'd be so

2442
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,400
much evidence

2443
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,360
for some kind of encoding what kind of

2444
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,239
encoding

2445
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,719
how much evidence how would we know but

2446
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,000
we'll find out

2447
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,400
maybe it would be overwhelming positive

2448
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,360
evidence

2449
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,760
for the identity thesis and then as

2450
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,800
always

2451
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,320
then what what then then if then

2452
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,480
all these cool learning terms that dean

2453
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,159
has been helping us understand

2454
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,800
what would happen then what would happen

2455
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,040
if the identity thesis

2456
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,239
is true or not and then what would we be

2457
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:16,880
then so pretty fun

2458
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,600
thank you both for participating any

2459
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,520
last thoughts we'll have just a closing

2460
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,719
section if anyone wants to ask a

2461
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,639
question a live chat they can otherwise

2462
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:25,120
we'll just

2463
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,360
close it out can i ask one quick

2464
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,040
question oh yes

2465
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,080
yeah so i'm glad

2466
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,360
blue brought up the thing that she

2467
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,280
thought was really important about the

2468
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,480
paper out

2469
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,560
so i want to kind of swing all the way

2470
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,840
back to the beginning

2471
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,400
because i think identity as a as

2472
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,840
proximal formalism

2473
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,400
is really important and i part i want to

2474
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,719
just read part of what he wrote

2475
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,880
right directly under this section for a

2476
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,560
transparent code because he never really

2477
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,560
does get into this too much but

2478
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,400
i think i think it kind of matters he

2479
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,880
wrote stochastic coding and variational

2480
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,400
inference in order for the thesis of

2481
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,440
this paper

2482
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,040
to make sense it must be kept in view

2483
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,199
that the generative and recognition

2484
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,840
densities of variational inference or

2485
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,280
densities over and then he puts in

2486
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,040
brackets possible

2487
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,360
external causes of the sensory input

2488
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,199
that is to say in the parlance of most

2489
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,320
philosophers

2490
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,880
and nearly all cognitive scientists they

2491
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,199
are representations and it is their

2492
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:24,320
representational function that defines

2493
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,320
them as statistical models

2494
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,239
fixing the encoding of the recognition

2495
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:29,440
generative

2496
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,360
densities allows us to directly relate

2497
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,800
the representational work

2498
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,679
in quotes done as the divergence between

2499
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:36,800
the densities

2500
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,679
is decreased decreased mind due to

2501
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,280
physical work

2502
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,880
that to me is would be amazing for him

2503
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,639
to be able to

2504
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,440
give that to me in in real terms of real

2505
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,480
examples

2506
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,000
of people doing that on a on a sort of

2507
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,120
ad hoc basis because that would be

2508
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,239
lovely to turn the what is um because i

2509
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,840
understand appreciate the down the train

2510
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,719
track thing

2511
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,440
but the what if to be able to sort of

2512
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,280
translate that what he wrote there in

2513
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,199
terms of a transparent code

2514
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,840
around what if would would make my day

2515
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,760
and not just my model

2516
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,040
it would make my model of my day

2517
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,320
make my model of my day

2518
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,679
but that sounds super interesting

2519
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,440
and that part first about

2520
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,280
representations we didn't even tackle

2521
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,840
the representation question because also

2522
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,280
in several other

2523
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,520
streams we've asked about what is a

2524
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,199
representation

2525
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,440
internal representation where are these

2526
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,560
representations what if they're

2527
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,159
distributed in the environment

2528
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,080
or among agents is that still a

2529
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,159
representation but also that adjacent

2530
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,520
possible

2531
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,080
that's kind of like whoa if our

2532
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,440
perception

2533
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,159
is actually just the tip of the iceberg

2534
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,040
of a really

2535
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,040
deeper generative model and there's

2536
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,400
cases where it seems

2537
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,320
intuitive like oh i guess daytime is

2538
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,960
contingent on having a model of night

2539
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,480
or thinking a is contingent on

2540
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,760
knowing that it could be a or not a but

2541
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,800
even that whole framework for thinking

2542
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,159
is still just part of a bigger process

2543
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,920
and that's what i think a lot of

2544
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,080
philosophy tries to grasp at

2545
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,120
from a lot of sides

2546
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,760
we're working with a kind of forceps but

2547
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,800
there's like a bigger

2548
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,280
picture well it sounds like we're also

2549
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,400
working with something called a

2550
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,600
transparent code

2551
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,400
which blows me up because oh okay well

2552
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,000
if that's all it was can you just tell

2553
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,639
me

2554
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,560
show me what that is and i know it's

2555
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,600
going to be hard because it's

2556
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,880
transparent but

2557
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,520
hey let's go

2558
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,239
blue i'm good

2559
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,719
thanks guys well thanks to those who

2560
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,440
watched

2561
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,560
this live or in replay we hope that

2562
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
you'll join us for the discussion

2563
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,159
when it happens or after

2564
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,760
thank you so great times talk to you

2565
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,239
later dean talk
