00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,759
and welcome everyone to actin flap

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,880
this is the actin flab live stream

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,039
and i'm pretty sure we're live yes we

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,160
are

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,519
it's number 22.1 on may 18

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,760
2021 and this is going to be really

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
great discussion so i'm looking forward

actin flab we are a participatory online

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,360
lab

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,520
that is communicating learning and

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
practicing applied active inference

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,520
you can find us at the links that are

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
here on this page

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,079
this is recorded and an archived live

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
stream so please provide us with

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,559
feedback

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,120
so that we can improve our work all

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
here and we'll be following

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,840
good live stream etiquette welcome scott

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,800
and

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
raising our hands to ask questions and

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
hear from everybody because this is

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
really going to be a special discussion

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
we're here in paper number 22 and on may

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,799
18th today

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
and next week on the 25th we're going to

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,320
be having two discussions

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
on the paper psychophysical identity and

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,080
free energy

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
by alex kiefer so thanks a lot alex for

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
joining us live and engaging with the

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,119
dot

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
zero video because we gained a lot as a

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,240
lab

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
working through that and so we're ready

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
to take it to the next level through

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,479
conversation

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
with you thank you thank you and today

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,479
we're gonna be

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
learning and discussing the papers link

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,799
is here

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
and the video is just us unpacking and

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,720
exploring

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
raising questions and we're going to be

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
also taking notes so that in the dot 2

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,159
we can be following up we're going to

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
start with some introductions

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
just to introduce ourselves and also

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
maybe to raise any thoughts

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,079
or questions that we had at the outset

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,360
about the paper so

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
everyone can feel free to write down

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
points or write down questions so they

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,360
don't uh forget them

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
and we're pretty much just gonna jump

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
around to any

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
topic or question that drives us along

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
and we'll flow with it as people join

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
and leave

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
and there will be a follow-up discussion

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,879
22 next week

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
that brings us to the introductions and

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
the warm-ups

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,879
so i'll start and we'll pass it around

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
and then end up with alex

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
who will provide i think a short

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
introduction to the paper

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,480
and then we'll continue the discussion

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
from there

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
so i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
california

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,640
and something i'm excited about today

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,200
was

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
something we were just speaking about

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
right before was learning about a

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
transparent code

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,400
and understanding what that might mean

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,599
i'll pass it to

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
scott

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
hello i'm scott david i'm at the

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
university of washington applied physics

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,120
lab

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,920
where i run a program called the

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
information risk and synthetic

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
intelligence research initiative

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
and i'm delighted to be here today and

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
i'll pass it to stephen

92
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
i'm doing a practice-based phd

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
at canterbury christchurch and um i'm

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,080
really excited about

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,720
the psychophysical areas being brought

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
in with this

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,360
process with energy so i'm intrigued

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
because that's

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
connects to some of the research i do

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
with communities in their landscape

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
and how to understand that so thank you

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
and i'm going to pass it over to alex

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,879
thanks hi everyone i'm alex watkins

i'm a researcher in philosophy and

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
cognitive science and i do some

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
modeling as well um i'm i have an

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
affiliation with monash university

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
um i'm currently also a lot of my time

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
is devoted to working

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
for uh nested minds solutions which is

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,600
um

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
an enterprise uh started by maxwell

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
ramstad and some other people

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,440
uh just recently uh we've already got a

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,080
lot of work

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,919
under our belt um so i'm really happy to

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,720
be here um

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
thanks thanks for having me this is like

133
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
i think gonna be a really fun discussion

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
um cool maybe just

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
while the other participants are

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
preparing a thought

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
or a question to lead off alex just how

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
did you

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
come to writing this single author paper

140
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
what yeah in your path led you to write

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
it this way

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
yeah sure um so uh so this is an idea

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,280
that

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
i think first sort of uh came up for me

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
in

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
2015 or so um

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
so i've been fascinated by this formal

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,759
analogy between

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
optimization and uh processes and

150
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
thermodynamics and physics

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
um for a long time since well not that

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
long maybe 2012 2013 when i started

153
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,160
getting into the neural net literature

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,639
on

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,800
helmholtz machines and things like that

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
and um

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
so i think this this analogy uh between

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
physics and optimization has been

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,759
tempting

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
for a lot of people to want to collapse

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
these right and this is something that

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
people like um

163
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
my friend mel andrews constantly warned

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
against is like just taking the physical

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
informational description of the system

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
to be uh the same

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
as as its physical description but i

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,199
thought that there was

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
a compelling argument to be made here so

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
i wanted to actually articulate not

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
necessarily endorse

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
right i think the way i couch things in

173
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
the paper is a bit cautious on this but

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,400
i wanted to articulate

175
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,080
what is the most sort of the simplest

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
most kind of perhaps radical perspective

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
one could take on this

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
the relationship between the cognitive

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,319
dynamics and the physical dynamics

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,160
um that you might be able to defend

181
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
right from a sort of free energy

182
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
principle-ish perspective

183
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
um so i wanted to to um just

184
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
lay that that one way of understanding

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
this relationship out that was

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
that was as clear as possible um i think

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,400
in the process i ended up writing

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
a paper that many people find to be

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
quite complicated so this was supposed

190
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,520
to be an exposition of a simple idea

191
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
so maybe we can see if we can get back

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
to that

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
awesome so anyone can raise their hand

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
and we'll just start but i really liked

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
how you said articulate but not

196
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
endorse you've put out an artifact for

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
us to

198
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
interact with and to explore and you

199
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
have framed

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
the psychophysical identity thesis as a

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,280
hypothesis

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
so it's something that evidence can now

203
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,319
be used

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,280
to support or to disprove and that's

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
sort of um

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,680
a nice piece of work that now obviously

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,400
we have

208
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
started the discussion around so we'll

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
go to stephen and then scott and then

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
anyone else with a raised hand

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
one thing i like about what you're doing

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
here is you're sort of bringing it into

213
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
the domains where the action is

214
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
happening it's a bit like

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
most of the physics around

216
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
thermodynamics is really often used in

217
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
chemistry and a lot like niels bohr was

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,319
actually a chemist

219
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
wasn't a physicist per se he used

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
physics so there's an interesting thing

221
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
about how

222
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
these areas get transposed over you know

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,520
and

224
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
may be layered again to biochemistry

225
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,639
which maybe is trying to look at the

226
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
mechanisms that sit on that

227
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,919
and xyz so i think that's quite relevant

228
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,639
to

229
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,759
some of the questions we've been

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
wrestling with with what happens when

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
things start to transit

232
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
transition to the ontology like and how

233
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
how can you keep a handle on that when

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,759
you've got people from different

235
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,919
backgrounds so i i think that's quite

236
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,840
interesting awesome thank you stephen

237
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,840
scott and then anyone else with a raised

238
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
hand

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
yeah i'd like to just ask about your

240
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
having written the paper and now

241
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,599
contemplated it discussed it with folks

242
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
what's your impression of the role

243
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
of the observer of difference

244
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,800
of gaps of differences

245
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,480
in identifying sources

246
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
of free energy

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
um exploitable sources let me let me

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
back up

249
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
one i did a paper in uh presentation in

250
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
um

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,839
mit in 2013 called entropy

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
and i asserted that carnot's equation

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
the hot and cold differentials that are

254
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
reflected there are the same as

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
arbitrage equations

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
in markets because you and i asserted

257
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
that heat engines were produced by the

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
human mind

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
observing an attribute because it didn't

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
matter that we thought we had a flow of

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
caloric

262
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
and it was flowing downhill we actually

263
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,959
the notion of flow

264
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
was what we asserted in order to convert

265
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
random heat random motion of particles

266
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
which we really only use for warmth

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
being able to put that into a cylinder a

268
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
combustion chamber and then perform work

269
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
took thousands of years i wonder if you

270
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
could comment on

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
it feels like we're using information

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,279
like the cavemen

273
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
as for warmth and not yet putting it in

274
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,839
a combustion chamber

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
and the combustion is it the fact that

276
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,720
the processes

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
where differentials are captured

278
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
exploited

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
utilized i'm not sure what word to use

280
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
here is that a

281
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
night like a reaction chamber are we

282
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
reacting observations and data

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,959
into inference in these reaction

284
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
chambers of mind

285
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
similar to the differentials that we

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,640
exploit

287
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
to in a heat engine for work are we able

288
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
to

289
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
to capture what are the devices of

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
capture sorry for the long question

291
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,120
right

292
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
yeah your hand on your chin makes me

293
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
think that maybe it's an intriguing

294
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,079
question

295
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,519
it's definitely intriguing i probably

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
can't do justice to it but um

297
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
i'll try um so just on the last point i

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
guess i think that the

299
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
um well actually so first to take your

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
your question about information

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
um whether we're using it um

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
so are you sort of like whether we're

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,360
really exploiting it

304
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
up to its maximum possibilities right as

305
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,480
information

306
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
or just or just treating it as sort of

307
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
you know

308
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
uh something like warmth a source of

309
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
warmth i mean i

310
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
i take it that insofar as we're using

311
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
information

312
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
so i right so it gets to the heart of my

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
perspective and to this

314
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
perspective of this paper i guess so i

315
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,240
said i flowed this thesis as a

316
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
possibility but i

317
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
i do kind of have some sort of

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,079
deep-seated conviction that that

319
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
information can always be looked at

320
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
sort of in terms of what it represents

321
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
and and physically right so any process

322
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
of information

323
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
uh information is literally a process of

324
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
physical change as well as

325
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
as well as a process of some system

326
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
coming to know something

327
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
right so to take the etymology right

328
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
just go back to shannon's original

329
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
framing

330
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
information is just the amount by which

331
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,680
someone or something has been informed

332
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,320
in my in my view so um so i think

333
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
insofar as we're treating something as

334
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,800
information

335
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
we are using it as information um

336
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
right it's not now i don't know what the

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
announce maybe i'd love to hear more

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
from you on this i don't know what the

339
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,360
analogy

340
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
would be to using information just as

341
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
heat is it like

342
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,320
we're aware of something but we're not

343
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
really doing anything with it like in

344
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,639
terms of inference

345
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,399
or uh so so i guess

346
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
my my view is that we are in so far as

347
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,639
we're thinking

348
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,240
and exploiting information sources for

349
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
inference we're using it to its

350
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
um maybe not maximally efficiently

351
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
always but we're using it

352
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,639
in a way that's that's intelligent but

353
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
but just one more point in this like

354
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
um the the analogy to combustion engine

355
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,360
and like

356
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
the the idea of um

357
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
i guess my thesis here is that anytime

358
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
we're performing an inference

359
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
any system is performing an inference

360
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,399
the physical

361
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
aspect of that is something like

362
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
right it is an actual physical reaction

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
so there is always something

364
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
that has precisely that nature behind

365
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,480
any

366
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,160
uh use of information um but i think

367
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
everything i just said sounds to me

368
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
completely trivial as i'm saying it so

369
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
um

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
that's its power yes perhaps

371
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
what did you mean we can unpack that

372
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,160
because

373
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,720
it's known that is um not just simply

374
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
wasted but where there's a heat

375
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
differential

376
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
there can be work and potentially when

377
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,160
there's an information

378
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
differential there can be an analogy to

379
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
physical work but in the informational

380
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
regime so what motivates that line of

381
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,160
thinking

382
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
for you yeah it was well and again i'll

383
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,839
send around the

384
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
slides from 2013 but but the idea was

385
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,760
that

386
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,880
it is not by analogy it really is

387
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,399
a capturing by the mind of an

388
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
attribute of a system right you look at

389
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,320
a block of iron it has

390
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,959
spin it has temperature it has color

391
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
there's all sorts of dimensions that it

392
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,360
has

393
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
that are unexploited um and then we can

394
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
look at them and exploit them for

395
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,639
different you know magnetism with spin

396
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
and then temper or electronic electrons

397
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
flow through iron same block iron it's

398
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,680
just sitting there

399
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
but you measure different attributes and

400
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
as you measure different attributes you

401
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
measure them into existence and that

402
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
existence then can be exploited

403
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
and so we did that with heat right they

404
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,320
thought that heat was caloric they

405
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,240
actually thought it was a fluid

406
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
right and that it but then the the guy

407
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
who is the cannon borer i forget which

408
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
one the guy who board the brass cannons

409
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
he said wait a second it can't be a

410
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
fluid because it's unlimited it's a

411
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
quality of the material

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
so i think what we're talking about in

413
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,240
information it's a quality not of the

414
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
brain

415
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
of the it's quality of the mind and the

416
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
differential between the brain

417
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
and the individual and the mind there's

418
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,279
a there's a

419
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
mind out there to be learned let's call

420
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
it an environment if it's animals but if

421
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,639
it's humans it also involves language

422
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
and when you're born you don't know it

423
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,000
and then you go learn it

424
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so your brain has to get tuned into the

425
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
mind so to me the mind is our combustion

426
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
chamber

427
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
and you gotta learn the combustion now

428
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
if you do if you're different learn

429
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
different things if i'm a hunter

430
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,760
gatherer i'm going to learn different

431
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,480
things in my environment to combust

432
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
right i'm going to have different cues

433
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
and i'm going to say wow this is

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
relevant for me because i got to do this

435
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,199
and this

436
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,639
so you the we train i think we train

437
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
our combustion chamber it's symbolic

438
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
right since we're training this thing in

439
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
which to contain

440
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
the differential accomplishment

441
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
of the active inference the beijing

442
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
accomplishment

443
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
and then we trained so it was an article

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
in just the last thing i'll shut up

445
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
for a minute there was an article in

446
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
nature magazine a couple years ago they

447
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
said less than 12 month old human

448
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,240
infants learn in a beijing way if you

449
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
point to it if you tell a

450
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,199
baby a horse has four legs the

451
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,959
baby will point to a table a coffee

452
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
table and say horsey

453
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,040
then you say no

454
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
scott just disappeared it was too much

455
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
of a truth drop with the table

456
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
and the legs so stephen to you and we'll

457
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
return to scott when we can

458
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,800
okay please sorry okay scott's back

459
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,680
anyway continue with

460
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
okay continue from the table okay

461
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
yeah anyways bayesian you they beijing

462
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
accumulation you they'll point to a

463
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,759
table

464
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,959
then you point say you know let's have

465
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,399
hair they'll point to a dog and say

466
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,199
horsey then

467
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,560
they say no it has to have a main

468
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,839
they'll point to a horse and say garcia

469
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
so it's a beijing

470
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
the article was about bayesian assembly

471
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
of human knowledge

472
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
and so what if the baby is not really

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,199
assembling the knowledge but just tuning

474
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
their brain into the mind and the mind's

475
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,000
a combustion chamber

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,759
and the mind we teach we have to learn

477
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,120
the mind because that's the useful

478
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,399
combustion we've already

479
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
designed this community mind

480
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
to navigate space and we teach it to our

481
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
offspring in order to make them more fit

482
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,800
anyway else cool thank you

483
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,839
any thoughts on that alex well it's

484
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,639
interesting i

485
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
i don't know if i completely understand

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
the way scott's using the term mind here

487
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,720
but

488
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
i think i kind of can see how something

489
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
that deserves to be called the mind

490
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
would emerge

491
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,839
through this sort of learning process

492
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,760
right so so i guess there's a trivial

493
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
sense i think in which

494
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
anything that has energetic properties

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,720
has a mental side

496
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
that's kind of what i'm saying in the

497
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
paper um

498
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,919
but it's trivial and if you want

499
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,280
something that really functions

500
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,319
cognitively

501
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
then you need to have internalized a lot

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
of these regularities through

503
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
you know the sorts of learning and

504
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
infant schemes that we're

505
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
familiar with here so um if if that's

506
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,640
what you

507
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
mean by learning the mind i think scott

508
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,000
you now guys

509
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
analogized it to the environment at some

510
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
point or maybe it's more than an analogy

511
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
um it's like the the data the the source

512
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
right of the data sensory data that

513
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
you're interpreting um

514
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
so uh yeah i think it's a cool idea

515
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
cool stephen welcome blue

516
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
steven with a question and then anyone

517
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,760
else with a question or blue you can say

518
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
hello

519
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
yeah one question i'd be interested in

520
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
is um

521
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
do you see maybe more than one um

522
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
type of information processing that may

523
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,080
be happening at different levels

524
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
so maybe you've got because we've had

525
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
people talking say at the quantum

526
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,360
level which could be happening

527
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
particularly say the photons coming in

528
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
with the iris

529
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
and things going up and then you've got

530
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
other levels where you've got these

531
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
steady states

532
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
going at different rates and then you've

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
got

534
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,160
some of the things you're talking about

535
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
where maybe it goes into

536
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
this sense of a more averaged closed

537
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
mind idea which would have to be somehow

538
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
created maybe because

539
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
the dynamical nature of the data and the

540
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
noise is not necessarily

541
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
exactly how it is when it first arrives

542
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
at the organism

543
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
but maybe you're you're you're bringing

544
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
back some of that more

545
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
averaged out heat ideas

546
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
um around how energy can be averaged

547
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
over time

548
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
in in some sort of heat form is that

549
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
would that be accurate

550
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,799
um i'm not sure about the heat piece i'm

551
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,280
just

552
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
genuinely not sure we can talk more

553
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
about it but like

554
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
as far as multiple types of information

555
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,679
processing

556
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,160
i mean i think that's definitely what's

557
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,120
happening in the

558
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
you know in the brain of course and

559
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
there's all this

560
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
literature on on multi-scale active

561
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
inference and stuff which

562
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,200
my paper isn't directly about active

563
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
inference but um

564
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
uh i think like there's no so we tend to

565
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,000
signal out certain processes in the

566
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,799
brain as like

567
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,600
processing information but really that's

568
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,320
going on

569
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
on you know uh in on fine grade levels

570
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,760
uh and on larger scales as you say um

571
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
i think we tend to just pick out one

572
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,799
piece to analyze at a time i guess

573
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
the part of the question i don't know

574
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
how to answer is like what

575
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
what are the types of information

576
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
processing in question so

577
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
um i guess i'm skeptical of that type

578
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
distinction not not against it i'm just

579
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,080
not sure

580
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
what what kind of types we have in mind

581
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
but um

582
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
definitely i think there's a there's a

583
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
rule for averaging uh just in

584
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
if we even if we just stick to neurons

585
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,559
and don't worry about

586
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,520
underlying chemistry or physics like uh

587
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,080
if

588
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,679
it can't just be that one neuron

589
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
inspiring uh represents

590
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
you know your grandmother because then

591
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
if that neuron's shot then you can't

592
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,280
represent your grandmother

593
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
so um i think there has to be a

594
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,400
if we want to associate content with

595
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
brain states for example

596
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
those states are going to have to be

597
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
couched at the level of averages in some

598
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
in some sense or some kind of

599
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
statistical uh property

600
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
um and i i think that comes out clearly

601
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
also in the work that carl firsten and

602
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
uh banyan uh and others have done on

603
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
on the whole markovian modism idea so

604
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,320
they talk about the fact that it's

605
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,679
um uh you know it's um it's not

606
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,280
individual brain states that encode

607
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,039
information on their view it's it's the

608
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,200
the mean of the distribution

609
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
uh conditional distribution anyway going

610
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,039
a bit into the weeds on this but i

611
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
i i do think that um that's important uh

612
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
heat i don't know let's talk more about

613
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,240
it

614
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
yeah keith we had the what is

615
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,840
temperature slide which i'll

616
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,559
just switch to yeah yeah wait stephen do

617
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,440
you have any other thoughts

618
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
well you know don't slide and maybe just

619
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,559
as

620
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
just a sort of following from that is

621
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,840
maybe

622
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
something about the mind and the level

623
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
of the psychophysical

624
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,919
maybe actually the mind is kind of a

625
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
psychophysical level

626
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
as much we think of as a brain level but

627
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,400
maybe what you're pointing to is

628
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,000
something a bit more of an of a dynamic

629
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
um which is kind of interesting yeah

630
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,840
i mean i i generally sorry i generally

631
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
have trouble seeing distinctions between

632
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
levels so

633
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,159
so maybe that's what you know you you

634
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
all could help point out

635
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600
like why these things are not the same

636
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
uh and it wouldn't would help me

637
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,919
go ahead hence the psychophysical

638
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,200
identity thesis

639
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
paper that you wrote right because

640
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,039
that's the entire topic of this

641
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,000
discussion

642
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
is what are those relationships and are

643
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,039
they

644
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
like each other or are they

645
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
overlapping are they isomorphic are they

646
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
one of the same so

647
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,720
um here on this temperature slide

648
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,960
you wrote about how increases and

649
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
decreases

650
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
in temperature change the variance of

651
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
distributions

652
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
so maybe just what is temperature or

653
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,600
in this psychophysical identity mapping

654
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,679
what does temperature reflect because

655
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,200
changing the temperature on the brain

656
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
you're not just talking about going into

657
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,679
a warmer

658
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,280
room you're talking about something

659
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
related to inference so what is

660
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
happening there

661
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,559
well right i mean i guess i am saying

662
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:36,960
like

663
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
look if if you change the temperature in

664
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
the room and that ends up changing the

665
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
temperature of the brain

666
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,080
then it's kind of an implication of the

667
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,200
thesis that

668
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
you are changing the temperature of your

669
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
statistical model as well to some degree

670
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
right probably usually to an

671
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
imperceptible or

672
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
insignificant degree when something like

673
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,880
walking into a different room

674
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,799
because now the brain has its own

675
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,799
internal homeostasis and it's not like

676
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
we're gonna drastically directly affect

677
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
the brain's temp

678
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
internal temperature um by changing the

679
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
room temperature one degree but i really

680
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
am uh

681
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
you know speculating or i'm considering

682
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
the consequences of

683
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
i mean the overall theme here and

684
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
temperature is a special case but the

685
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,360
overall theme is that

686
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,320
uh anything that you want like so any of

687
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,679
the terms in the home holds free energy

688
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
from from physics from thermodynamics

689
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
um should directly this is a transparent

690
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
encoding idea it should directly sort of

691
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
be reflected in the cognitive dynamics

692
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,799
and so the cognitively speaking what

693
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
temperature means

694
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,600
like it says here is just um uh

695
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
you know temperature parameters in

696
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,279
models neural network models and other

697
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,799
sorts of models um

698
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,080
i think i've heard this referred to in

699
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,120
the active inference literature as the

700
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
as the shaky hand parameter

701
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,799
right so it's like you're reaching for

702
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,080
something if you increase the

703
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
temperature parameter there's less

704
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
certainty

705
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
and exactly where the motor system will

706
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,679
end up right so

707
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,600
that's that's what it means cognitively

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
speaking uh

709
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,159
or if you don't want to call motor

710
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,760
control low level motor control

711
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,039
cognitive then

712
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,919
in terms of of these models of organisms

713
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
what it means is just

714
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,679
literally just the variability of the

715
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
distribution

716
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,039
right the variance so um i guess what

717
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,240
i'm saying is

718
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,559
yes i think if this thesis is true then

719
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,080
what encodes that

720
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,279
is the actual temperature of the system

721
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,559
that implements the model very

722
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,279
interesting thank you we'll go to blue

723
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,000
and then

724
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,320
scott

725
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
good morning i'm blue knight i'm a

726
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,559
research consultant

727
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
based out of new mexico and i really

728
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,799
enjoyed this paper i really enjoyed

729
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
the possibility of having a way to

730
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
separate

731
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,799
the mind from simulations of the mind i

732
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,919
think that that's a really

733
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,200
um relevant and pertinent idea to put

734
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
forward

735
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,960
but so in in relevance to temperature

736
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
and this is going to like totally throw

737
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
what i just said out the window

738
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
uh you know i i um it dabbled a little

739
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
bit in retail investing right and so

740
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,120
like the day before or like maybe in the

741
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,919
morning

742
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
you might like what's called take the

743
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
temperature of the market

744
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,919
right so you see kind of as things going

745
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,360
up or things going down like you just

746
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,799
kind of put your feelers out there

747
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,880
and take the temperature of what the

748
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
market's going to do

749
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
so i just wonder in terms of cognition

750
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,480
in terms of active inference if there's

751
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
a way to

752
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
like take the temperature in in maybe

753
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
like more of a

754
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,159
um of a metaphorical sense

755
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,520
right does that make sense

756
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,760
um i'm not sure um

757
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
so just i can elaborate a little bit

758
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,960
more like what uh

759
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,159
like in in the political system right

760
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:50,640
like

761
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
we get like a temperature like is this

762
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
like a liberal environment or is it like

763
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,440
a more conservative environment and that

764
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
might influence

765
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,480
our actions right like the active

766
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,679
inference loop might be

767
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,320
influenced by the perception of

768
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,039
temperature

769
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,720
in the environment right

770
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,760
so yeah i mean uh first of all hi thanks

771
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,320
for joining

772
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,279
um you you and dean and daniel uh you

773
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,520
all

774
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
i really enjoyed your discussion but in

775
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,559
point zero and

776
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,320
it made me excited to talk about it

777
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
today because it's it's cool how

778
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,720
just how many different questions or you

779
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
know anyway whatever it's cool

780
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,799
so um i mean sure you could use

781
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
temperature in a metaphorical way as

782
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
well like

783
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,720
um i think uh

784
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,919
it like i i guess in this paper i tend

785
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,240
to

786
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,000
i i like i tend to assume that

787
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,480
when people that that metaphors are are

788
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
not metaphors but identities right as

789
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
they graph

790
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
the ground level assumption and then see

791
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
see where that you're forced to

792
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
distinguish between them

793
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
so like if we're talking about again if

794
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,679
you're talking about a model of motor

795
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,960
control where you're literally reaching

796
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,760
for something

797
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
then i think in that case it's plausible

798
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
that there's some relationship between

799
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
the actual temperature of the pieces of

800
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
the system that are driving the motion

801
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
and the temperature parameter in the

802
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
model but like if you're talking about

803
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,520
something like

804
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
taking the temperature of the market or

805
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
you know the political

806
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,640
there still might be partial mappings

807
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,039
there

808
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,600
right like but you know if you're

809
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
defining some arbitrary dimensions so if

810
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,360
the the temperature politically means

811
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,279
one side of the scale is is conservative

812
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
and the other side is liberal

813
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
then then i wouldn't expect that there

814
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,720
would be some physical component to that

815
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
um but the same way that your paper was

816
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
uh as you said just putting it out there

817
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,799
not endorsing the psychophysical

818
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,159
identity it's almost like

819
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,520
an econophysical identity thesis

820
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
would be asking whether the thermo-like

821
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
dynamics of markets actually have some

822
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,080
sort of

823
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,159
mapping that's more than a metaphor but

824
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,640
it's something that can be stated and

825
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
blanketed or boxed off and then can be

826
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
understood as being adequate in certain

827
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
situations but maybe inadequate

828
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
in other situations but when we talk

829
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,440
about the market heating up

830
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
people know what that means in a way

831
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,279
where you know the market feeling happy

832
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,039
doesn't really capture it heating up or

833
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
cooling down so

834
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
scott and then anyone else with a raised

835
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,559
hands

836
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
oops i'm not sure if i should try to

837
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,880
share my screen i may just screw up so

838
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,320
let's not do that but let me

839
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
so i just pulled up my slides from 2013

840
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,840
and so

841
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,200
i said under the first law of

842
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,039
thermodynamics temperature has

843
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,559
two roles first from the perspective of

844
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,440
a party

845
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
outside the system temperature tells

846
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,960
whether two or more systems are in

847
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
thermal equilibrium

848
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,159
same temperature equals equilibrium okay

849
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,399
from the perspective of a molecule in

850
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,080
the system

851
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,159
temperature tells about the distribution

852
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,320
of various molecules in the system over

853
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
the possible energy states right the

854
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
higher temperature equals a broader

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,279
distribution of molecules in different

856
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,840
states and a higher boltzmann

857
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,559
distribution so what i'm

858
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,399
asserting in this context in the context

859
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
of those earlier slides

860
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,760
was analogously here

861
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,919
are we looking within this system of the

862
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,640
cognitive system and the dynamics of

863
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
components within it

864
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,039
or vis-a-vis an outside voice

865
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,559
for that system i think that's a

866
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,080
relevant question here because when

867
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
you're talking about

868
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,720
the first law in the in here

869
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,760
we don't we have um this is um

870
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,120
um um maxwell's demon is actually

871
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,240
a person now

872
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,399
sorry that obscure reference but

873
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,720
maxwell's demon was a convention

874
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,799
to plus with the second law of

875
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
thermodynamics a gating function

876
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,320
um and now we actually have

877
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,520
the notion of what does a molecule in

878
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
the system think

879
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,840
in a sense is what i'm inviting here and

880
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,679
this and so i think the assertion and

881
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,120
the assertion certainly i'm making that

882
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,440
context is we can capture

883
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
either one of those dynamics and it's

884
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
info dynamics you're not thermodynamics

885
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
is what i call it

886
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
but essentially first law tells you

887
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,600
about

888
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,799
interoperability is what my assertion is

889
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,520
because

890
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,000
you can have equilibrium in a symbolic

891
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,799
way i

892
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,120
assert is the equivalence of

893
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,159
interoperability symbolic

894
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,200
and so that's when you can have a

895
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
beating of the minds you can have shared

896
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
consciousness society

897
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
shared language all that kind of stuff

898
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
is my notion of where the

899
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,720
first law takes you thanks

900
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,279
that's really intriguing um i need to

901
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,159
read

902
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,240
your work on this please um

903
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,799
yeah i mean not to give a too hand-wavy

904
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,760
an answer but i think

905
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
since we're dealing with multiple scales

906
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,480
here we could talk about neurons

907
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
performing active inference

908
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,799
people doing it i think both of those

909
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,360
sort of uses of temperature are relevant

910
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
um

911
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,559
but exactly yeah um

912
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,320
we'll get to stephen but maybe just a

913
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
general question where does active

914
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,880
inference

915
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,840
come into play and how does it come into

916
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,960
play

917
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,559
oh yeah so um right so you

918
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,399
you guys raised in the point zero that i

919
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,600
didn't really talk about activations

920
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,039
that much in fact i only referenced the

921
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,799
literature on active entrance

922
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,760
um so this is yeah it's interesting this

923
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,960
paper isn't really about active

924
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
inference it's not

925
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,559
really directly about the fep either so

926
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,240
thank you for having me despite that

927
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,279
um but it's i mean obviously it's in the

928
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,519
it's in the very core it's concerned

929
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,840
with the same core issues right

930
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,159
but um i don't want to take us

931
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
on this if it's a tangent but the reason

932
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
that i don't write about active infants

933
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,760
that much is that i think from a

934
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
high enough or meaning abstract enough

935
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,600
point of view

936
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,880
um you you don't need i don't know that

937
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,399
there's really a difference

938
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,240
to me active influence kind of relates

939
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
to the stuff the way that like dawkins's

940
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,120
extended phenotype

941
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,679
proposal relates to more traditional

942
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,960
ways of thinking about

943
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,440
um evolution and genetics in that it's a

944
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
new paradigm

945
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,320
but i don't i don't think that there's a

946
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,679
system that you can describe using

947
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,640
active inference

948
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
that you couldn't also describe um using

949
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,480
say traditional

950
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,159
representationalist terminology so

951
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,840
that's obviously controversial

952
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,960
we could talk about it but um like

953
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
in so far as your as you're concerned

954
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,120
with analyzing or designing a system

955
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,559
like right like if you wanna even if you

956
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,559
want to write an active inference agent

957
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,720
as a model you only have control over

958
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
its internal states

959
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
you can't directly control it needs yes

960
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,600
it optimizes

961
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,559
um its situation by acting and

962
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,320
intervening on the environment

963
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,519
but you can't directly control

964
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,960
how the intervention on the environment

965
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,559
plays out you can only control the

966
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
expectations for sensory data given

967
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,919
that you've acted in such a way and so

968
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,320
um

969
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,799
that's why i tend to just default to you

970
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,360
know it's what

971
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
jerry fodor called methodological

972
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
solipsism right which is a

973
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,159
very different perspective from what

974
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,720
people i think i'd love to talk about

975
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,279
this maybe

976
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,720
maybe they're more similar than i than i

977
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
think too but um

978
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,799
anyway so so uh like active inference is

979
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,279
great i think in fact it leads to new

980
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,120
ideas for technology and new models just

981
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,240
because it's a different way of thinking

982
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
about things

983
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,039
but when you're doing like philosophical

984
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
analysis like this

985
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,960
i don't find that it's for me often

986
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
necessary

987
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,720
to think in those terms but i would love

988
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,840
for someone to point out

989
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,200
something that i'm missing by not doing

990
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
that

991
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,919
well what we love here in the active lab

992
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,159
is hearing everyone's perspective

993
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,200
on active inference and also adjacencies

994
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,279
and synonyms and other languages and

995
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
other ways of expressing it so thanks

996
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,279
for

997
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,000
sharing it the way you did um steven if

998
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,320
you

999
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,000
wanted to okay yeah

1000
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,360
so so building on that you you mentioned

1001
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
the helmholtz free energy

1002
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
rather than the gibbs free energy so you

1003
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,519
sort of the broader sort of

1004
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,559
energy that's available um

1005
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,880
the the i suppose a question i've got

1006
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,679
here is in

1007
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,159
in this in that um actually go back to

1008
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,760
that diagram just one sec with the

1009
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,240
distributions there you've got just

1010
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,599
you you've got both the difference in

1011
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,520
the sort of the size the distribution

1012
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,839
for the different size molecules

1013
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,679
but you've got the average speed is

1014
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
higher for

1015
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,239
um hydrogen but yeah hydrogen or

1016
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,280
oxygen it's it's faster it's the speed

1017
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
is faster for

1018
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,320
something that's lighter and that may

1019
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
have an impact

1020
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,918
at the local level when the actual atoms

1021
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,159
are

1022
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,079
hitting each other at the same

1023
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,520
temperature but

1024
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,159
when you take the average it's all

1025
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,440
around the same energy

1026
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,520
if that makes sense so i just wondered

1027
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,879
if there's any

1028
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
particular sort of relationship

1029
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,040
to the way that the speeds

1030
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
are happening and the way that might

1031
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,679
change something at a certain scale

1032
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,599
and just helm holds and gives free

1033
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,000
energy

1034
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,440
yeah um so to be honest i mean the

1035
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,240
reason i wrote

1036
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,560
i write about helmholtz free energy is

1037
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,440
um

1038
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
just because it's the thing that jeff

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,119
hinton and others

1040
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,400
um used in their um

1041
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
when setting up things like the

1042
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
helmholtz machine um the gibbs free

1043
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,560
energy

1044
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,720
uh i'm just less familiar with it's it's

1045
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,079
it adds complications that i thought

1046
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,119
weren't relevant but if they are

1047
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,680
relevant

1048
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,720
then let's talk about them um

1049
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
yeah could we maybe hear a little bit

1050
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
from you just what is free energy

1051
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,200
in the senses that you used it or how

1052
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
would you describe it to somebody who

1053
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,320
might be not very familiar with

1054
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,160
thermodynamics

1055
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,960
right um someone such as me for example

1056
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,359
so

1057
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,800
what i would say is well i mean i'm a

1058
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,960
philosopher but um

1059
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,800
uh so free energy in a physical and

1060
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,720
thermodynamic sense as i understand it

1061
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,760
again welcome i welcome any

1062
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,800
uh kings in the other direction um

1063
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
but as i understand it it's uh just the

1064
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,119
energy that's available

1065
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,320
for doing work in this

1066
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
the system so it's the internal energy

1067
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
the all the energy that the system

1068
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,560
harbors just in virtue of its

1069
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,599
configuration

1070
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,960
it's sort of existence at that moment um

1071
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,640
minus all all of the energy that's uh

1072
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,839
not usable because uh it's

1073
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
it's tied up with with sort of this

1074
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
disorder

1075
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,000
um with with entropy um

1076
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,119
so i'm sure that someone else here could

1077
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,240
maybe articulate that

1078
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,680
more gracefully than i just did but

1079
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,359
that's that's the one term

1080
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,560
and the other term in the in the

1081
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
equation here is the variational free

1082
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
energy

1083
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,440
which is just um the difference between

1084
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,079
a

1085
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,839
uh the the basically the

1086
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,839
the gen the gener the generative model

1087
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,359
or the the joint distribution that

1088
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,400
defines

1089
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,599
the system's generative model of um

1090
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,119
some kind of statistical model right

1091
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,040
more generally and

1092
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,240
um the approximation to it

1093
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,079
that you've arrived at at a particular

1094
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,680
time step right so if you're doing

1095
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
variational inference you're trying to

1096
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
fit this q distribution

1097
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
uh which i mean you know people this has

1098
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,240
been talked about ad nauseum so it's

1099
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,599
hard for me to get the energy to really

1100
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,720
launch into it because i feel like we

1101
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,280
all

1102
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,359
are familiar with this concept but it's

1103
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,720
it's just the difference between the

1104
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,599
approximating

1105
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,960
distribution the recognition

1106
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,359
distribution or density and the

1107
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
degenerative density so so it's so i

1108
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,599
guess the thing to underline there is

1109
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,640
that it's

1110
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
it's only defined in terms of these p's

1111
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
and q's right q recognition

1112
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,119
p generative that are they're defined in

1113
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,880
terms of the generative model which is a

1114
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
model right it's a

1115
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
it's a it's a um a mapping between

1116
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,119
like hypotheses right or hidden states

1117
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,440
and

1118
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,079
outcomes so there's obviously no a

1119
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,839
priori connection between that and like

1120
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,359
thermodynamics um

1121
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
so it's just important to keep in mind

1122
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
that one of these is is

1123
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,000
in terms of how it's defined as

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,680
thoroughly like cognitive has to do with

1125
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
belief updating and the other

1126
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,640
has to do with the physical states of

1127
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,440
the system and that mapping

1128
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
between the cognitive and the

1129
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
inferential and the physical

1130
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,720
is again the entire discussion

1131
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,599
and the entire point of putting out an

1132
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
artifact that

1133
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,440
is critiquable or is extendable in the

1134
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
ways that you made it

1135
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,320
so scott then stephen and then also

1136
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,040
anyone else

1137
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,119
who's watching live can just put a live

1138
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,720
chat in and we'll ask the question so

1139
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,119
scott

1140
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,640
and then stephen so this is really what

1141
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,160
a great conversation thank you we've got

1142
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,359
a great paper

1143
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,440
so couple things first first of all you

1144
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,880
know i wonder we always talk about it

1145
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,440
being by

1146
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,280
analogy and it's not really

1147
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,119
thermodynamics but von neumann

1148
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,440
said to shannon use the second law of

1149
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,280
thermodynamics for your quantitative

1150
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
theory of information

1151
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,560
because in his quote right his quote was

1152
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
because the math is identical

1153
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,240
which tells you something it at least

1154
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
tells you something about math

1155
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
and humans but may not tell you anything

1156
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,680
about the environment but it tells you

1157
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,960
something about math and humans

1158
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,720
but he also said and if you use the word

1159
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
entropy in any argument you'll win every

1160
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
time because no one will know what the

1161
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,520
hell you're talking about

1162
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,400
so that's good advice on both of those

1163
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
points right

1164
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,320
so i always look at it and i go okay so

1165
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
let's talk about those differentials and

1166
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,480
you know we took that free energy

1167
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,640
question that we just answered i

1168
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
so i deal in policy i'm not a biologist

1169
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,079
i'm a lawyer

1170
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,200
okay in a physics lab and the reason i'm

1171
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,560
interested in this stuff

1172
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,520
is i think you can access the external

1173
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,320
states

1174
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,800
and in fact i think that's all we do as

1175
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,760
social beings

1176
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,720
is we that's what rhetoric is i am

1177
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,160
constantly trying to

1178
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,280
lasso external states of everyone else

1179
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,640
that's what politics is that's

1180
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,160
all the whole misinformation problem

1181
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,400
right now we're setting out

1182
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,560
now in a biological example we kind of

1183
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
don't send around memos as much

1184
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,160
now there is there are communications

1185
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,359
obviously in

1186
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,359
in the sciences and in the nature and

1187
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,599
all that but when we get into the

1188
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,880
human populations

1189
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,480
we may have something more going on here

1190
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,920
maybe mind is an emergent phenomenon

1191
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,440
merely of the attempts at harmonically

1192
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,079
coupling with other minds

1193
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,119
maybe a break if we're successful

1194
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,119
in tuning into that local mind we

1195
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,880
survive if i

1196
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,079
am dropped into france and i don't speak

1197
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,160
french then am i going to survive

1198
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
now now i will but what if it was 300

1199
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,319
years ago or whatever right

1200
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,880
so you need to if it's if the mind is

1201
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,520
fair

1202
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,200
feral and is trained maybe

1203
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,280
that ability to affect the externality

1204
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,800
is everything

1205
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,760
maybe that's how we are humans in the

1206
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,200
way that we are because we're pretty

1207
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
pathetic little organisms on our own

1208
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,880
each one of us right we don't have sharp

1209
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
fingernails and our tooth and claw is

1210
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,920
not

1211
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
would get bloody but it would take a lot

1212
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
of biting because they're kind of blunt

1213
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,720
right so anyway that's a bit of a

1214
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
tangent but

1215
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,200
so the question is are we maybe if we

1216
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,960
look at the

1217
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
maybe we're not entering another brain

1218
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
maybe the mind is where the action

1219
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,520
is and when we're doing this in training

1220
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,680
maybe we're merely tuning into something

1221
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,280
that exists already

1222
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,160
in our in our attempts here at this for

1223
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
active inference and we're

1224
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,720
just getting on board with the existing

1225
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,400
mind and so therefore our steady state

1226
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
our homeostatic state is the one that is

1227
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,040
most aligned with the externality

1228
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,520
that's drawing us there and as lawyers

1229
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
and as policy people

1230
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
we create artificial externalities

1231
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
that's why i use synthetic intelligence

1232
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
in our title

1233
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
we're creating synthetic externalities

1234
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,920
and saying hey come on over here we've

1235
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
got a good externality over here check

1236
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,000
it out

1237
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
this one's resilient sustainable and the

1238
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,520
sdgs in the u.n love it

1239
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,319
right so we're creating realities what

1240
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,560
do you think about that in terms of the

1241
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,079
notion of the uh efficacy

1242
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,920
of the possibility of harmonic coupling

1243
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
with other minds and that as

1244
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,880
a another active activity in active

1245
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,000
energy is not just changing your

1246
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,359
internal model

1247
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,760
yes it's extremely interesting so um

1248
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,119
i mean i think this question of how

1249
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,880
exactly the external states get into the

1250
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,440
picture is

1251
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,119
is like pretty fundamental for a lot of

1252
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,640
people who are in this area

1253
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
and uh i i think you're right that it's

1254
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,040
it's it's essential but it's essential

1255
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,720
in a strange way where it's completely

1256
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
inessential too so like

1257
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,119
if it's it's essential in that the yeah

1258
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,400
the reason that your steady state is

1259
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,920
what it is

1260
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,359
essentially involves the environment

1261
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,560
right so like in the free energy

1262
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,920
principle the

1263
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,440
the nest the non-equilibrium steady

1264
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
state is defined with respect to the

1265
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,839
situ

1266
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,520
this you know a sort of a subsystem

1267
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,760
that's embedded in an environment and

1268
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
that steady state wouldn't exist without

1269
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,960
both pieces of that

1270
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,240
right and it's the fact that you're

1271
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,000
doing gradient descent on that

1272
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,960
that guarantees that your variational

1273
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,079
inferences is going

1274
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,119
anywhere useful uh and and that's that's

1275
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,000
sort of the

1276
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,920
sort of you know magical seeming

1277
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
connection between actual

1278
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,280
accuracy and and all this just churning

1279
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,760
that happens when you're minimizing free

1280
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,119
energy over time

1281
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,000
um but but the the way in which it's

1282
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
inessential is

1283
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
of course i mean i i just i guess maybe

1284
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:20,560
i'm

1285
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,160
maybe i've been called a cartesian

1286
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
before maybe i am i don't know i didn't

1287
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,720
mean to be but

1288
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,599
um there's a sense in which simply it

1289
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,119
just the datum here is just

1290
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,359
that i can get things wrong and i don't

1291
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,560
see that there's any obvious way of

1292
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,079
limiting the scope of that

1293
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,119
right so just fallablism um so

1294
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,599
i think there has to be some uh subset

1295
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,880
of states of the overall

1296
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,200
universe that you'd identify with you

1297
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,000
and

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,119
your perspective and otherwise right you

1299
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,599
have

1300
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,079
sure the external states are essential

1301
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,200
to this story

1302
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,400
and they drive the dynamics de facto

1303
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,160
but there has to be a difference between

1304
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,000
the actual external state at any moment

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,640
and the external state that i represent

1306
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,520
by my hidden

1307
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,480
states or my my internal states um and

1308
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,880
so

1309
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,079
i think you know

1310
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,640
like the reason any of this works in

1311
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,839
prac in practice

1312
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,560
is because we've internalized the

1313
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,200
structure

1314
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
of the external environment and this

1315
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,960
whole point about harmonic

1316
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,839
coupling between minds is really cool um

1317
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,119
it's there's something really cool and

1318
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,119
bootstrappy about that it's like

1319
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,640
right minds are things that harmonize

1320
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,319
with other minds right and

1321
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,680
um i don't just to kind of

1322
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,960
pick out another piece of what you said

1323
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,040
i um

1324
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
the way that i tend to think of this

1325
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,319
stuff is in terms of sort of imitation

1326
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,800
so the fundamental term for a lot of

1327
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,319
people in this area is prediction

1328
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,599
but i almost think it's more like we

1329
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,040
just learned to our brains learn to

1330
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
imitate

1331
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,800
the the sensory uh right the patterns of

1332
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,400
the processes that produce patterns of

1333
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,920
sensory input but the reason it's not

1334
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,280
just imitation is that

1335
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,800
also the world is just made up of a

1336
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,560
bunch of these generative models that

1337
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,960
each have their own driving right um

1338
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,240
signals so um so that

1339
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,000
i'm not sure i don't know i don't know

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,680
how to tie that up in a nice package but

1341
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,200
it's it's a cool set of questions

1342
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,720
um and uh

1343
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
but so so the reason though that i

1344
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,599
stopped short of saying that the

1345
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,000
external

1346
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
states are as fundamental

1347
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,359
in understanding cis systems biological

1348
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,400
systems uh

1349
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,280
people etc as the internal states is

1350
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,920
simply

1351
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,160
things like cartesian skepticism so we

1352
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,960
could talk about that

1353
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,760
um well yeah go ahead scott just a

1354
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,400
follow-up

1355
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,640
well it is interesting because it's um

1356
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,000
because our struggles in it

1357
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,800
when we you know i say on this this

1358
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,839
group very often

1359
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,599
the only time you see reality is when

1360
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,200
you see paradox

1361
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
right if you're seeing absence of

1362
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,800
paradox you're intrinsically seeing a

1363
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,560
model of some sort

1364
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,400
and so we should embrace a confused

1365
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,640
state and and know that that is a

1366
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,760
reality

1367
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,560
and so that is not just a statement for

1368
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,040
this conversation but in general

1369
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,680
maybe what the mind is doing is the same

1370
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,960
thing that the body does when it's

1371
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
standing still you're actually never

1372
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,040
still

1373
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,520
you're always dynamically moving to

1374
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,960
maintain

1375
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,119
a semblance of stasis in a banded

1376
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,400
stillness right

1377
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
so maybe we have a banded mind maybe

1378
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,079
it's fully dynamic

1379
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,960
and maybe what we think of as us an

1380
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,200
existential kind of element of it

1381
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,079
is within a band right do people change

1382
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,000
over time it's a ship theseus in a way

1383
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,440
right you're still the same person but

1384
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,400
you're

1385
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
some of the stuff has changed out

1386
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,920
swapped out over time um

1387
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,160
so maybe the embodiment helps us with

1388
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,000
mind as a fractal way at any

1389
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,720
level because we can say okay if we have

1390
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,760
a system

1391
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
that's doing processing of dynamic

1392
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,359
environment some of that processing may

1393
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,040
be internal some may be external

1394
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,520
i mean that's group formation and you

1395
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,319
know

1396
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
part of its genetic and consanguinous in

1397
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
terms of performance and some of it is

1398
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,640
people who are similarly situated right

1399
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,240
if you're in a disaster and everyone's

1400
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,599
all of a sudden has the same problems

1401
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,560
people band together

1402
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,000
all of a sudden very easily and their

1403
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,760
mind morphs into that

1404
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,000
organism that is needed for that acute

1405
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,280
situation

1406
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,359
in that stressful environment and so

1407
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,680
they maybe it's always dynamic but that

1408
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,240
we don't

1409
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
see the dynamics as much and they seem

1410
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,240
more leisurely when we're studying them

1411
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
in the abstract but maybe they're

1412
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
highly dynamic in both directions

1413
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,760
especially

1414
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,680
as we become information beings and more

1415
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,240
dependent on symbols

1416
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,960
thanks scott just one thought on the

1417
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,760
dynamics

1418
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,000
is anyone who's recorded a neuron or

1419
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,359
thought about that knows that just to

1420
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,960
keep an idea in your mind

1421
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,599
for a few seconds is being underwritten

1422
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,319
by

1423
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,559
vast numbers of dynamical processes that

1424
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,920
are quite rapid

1425
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,520
and the second point about the

1426
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,680
internalities and the externalities and

1427
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,240
the internal states and external states

1428
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,559
the helmholtz free energy has this u

1429
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,760
internal energy

1430
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,319
and that's like the configuration of the

1431
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,119
molecule

1432
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,440
usually thought of as and then this

1433
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,800
negative ts

1434
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,280
is sort of that those vibratory modes

1435
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,400
that can't be as

1436
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,119
easily harnessed but when you pointed to

1437
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,880
synthetic externalities

1438
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,640
which is the same thing as saying

1439
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,960
reconstructing the internalities

1440
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,920
it's like what if all of a sudden the

1441
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,599
organization of the system

1442
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,280
we could partition it a little bit

1443
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,599
differently so that we had more u

1444
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,440
and a little bit less ts and when you

1445
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,280
think about a vibrating molecule

1446
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,599
u makes it look like the covalent bonds

1447
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,440
and ts is the vibration

1448
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,079
but if you think about an ant colony the

1449
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,079
movement of the pieces

1450
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,760
is still part of the internal dynamics

1451
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,280
and so especially when we're talking

1452
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,359
about information which isn't covalently

1453
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,079
bonded

1454
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,200
atoms internal energy

1455
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,040
is something about the model it's not

1456
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
just about how things are touching and

1457
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,520
can be

1458
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
broken and reformed so there's a lot of

1459
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,280
awesome

1460
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,520
pieces in what you added there steven

1461
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,440
and then anyone else with a raised hand

1462
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,200
yeah i think building on that you're

1463
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,559
right the there's this in

1464
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,079
this i think you're making the right

1465
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,680
choice here for this paper using the

1466
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,079
helmholtz free energy i think that's a

1467
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,480
um even if gibbs free energies use more

1468
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,680
in active inference

1469
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,559
that adds an extra level of complication

1470
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,680
and i think this is actually

1471
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,800
useful then because you're

1472
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,160
able to look at some of these

1473
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,960
distribution questions and just how

1474
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,359
information is extracted but it's

1475
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,119
actually helpful for me to see you go

1476
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:31,520
back to

1477
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,839
the helmholtz because it makes me

1478
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,559
realize well

1479
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,000
that gives free energy which is more

1480
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,520
about how action happens how do you know

1481
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,720
what the internal energy change would

1482
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,680
have to do

1483
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
if it was trying to also keep within a

1484
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,200
certain constraint of volume

1485
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,119
and pressure which you don't have to

1486
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,319
worry about

1487
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,440
with helmholtz free energy that would

1488
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,200
bring in action that would bring in the

1489
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,960
action part of active influence

1490
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,280
in some ways um but the underlying

1491
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,160
principles

1492
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,559
still hold for what you've got you know

1493
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,800
so i think that's um

1494
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,599
that's helpful so i don't know if you've

1495
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,880
got any thoughts on that yeah

1496
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,400
yeah that is health i would just i would

1497
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,200
just say that that is helpful and um

1498
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,079
uh i would love if if in the future

1499
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,800
anyone

1500
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,359
yeah worked on this same topic and one

1501
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,720
and generally you know

1502
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,720
ex unpacked the the sort of um

1503
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,160
i was going to say generalization but

1504
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,559
it's maybe the opposite um the the

1505
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,400
how this would work out in the case of

1506
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,000
um

1507
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,359
of action more specifically and using

1508
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,559
gibbs free energy and stuff that would

1509
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,559
be really cool

1510
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,599
awesome and taking the temperature of

1511
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,480
a person in terms of going for a checkup

1512
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,280
to the doctor

1513
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,880
and they put the thermometer under your

1514
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,119
tongue and that's a thermal temperature

1515
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,760
and how are you feeling what does it

1516
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,280
look like to take the temperature just

1517
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,680
like

1518
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,559
blue had been suggesting so maybe let's

1519
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,720
go to the transparent code

1520
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,880
um slide that you added alex because

1521
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,240
that was definitely something that we

1522
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,640
were curious about from the dot zero

1523
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,800
and we can just hear your thoughts on

1524
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,240
this talk a little bit about this and

1525
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,079
then also anyone else can just

1526
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,160
write down a question raise their hand

1527
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,920
or ask in the live chat but we'd be

1528
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,200
really curious to hear what you thought

1529
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
about this

1530
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,599
yeah sure so um yeah so the reason that

1531
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,720
again that i put this in

1532
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,400
was that dean and um and

1533
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
maybe maybe everybody in that point zero

1534
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,240
um discussion had um

1535
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,200
had questions about this and i think uh

1536
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,720
the transparent code

1537
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,200
it ends up sounding like a slogan that

1538
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,559
invites you know

1539
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,240
speculation and it's like it's a mystery

1540
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,920
or something but

1541
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,440
um this might be a case where i'm trying

1542
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,960
to say something so simple that it's

1543
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,079
like

1544
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,480
it's easy to miss right so so all um

1545
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,400
the role let me just first frame this

1546
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,079
the role that this plays in the paper

1547
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,280
is that if you want it to be that

1548
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,319
variational free energy and

1549
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,280
hellhole's free energy in the

1550
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,760
thermodynamic sense um

1551
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,160
are the same quantity then you're going

1552
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,440
to have to

1553
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,559
um explain how

1554
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,079
well both of them are sort of made up of

1555
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,400
probabilities right so you need to

1556
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,839
have a mapping from one set of

1557
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,680
probabilities to the other

1558
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,640
um so uh there has to be a way of

1559
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,440
understanding how

1560
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
the probabilities of states this is a

1561
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
big distinction in the literature right

1562
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,880
how the probabilities of states

1563
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,400
could represent could represent so the

1564
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,800
probabilities of states in the system

1565
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,920
the cognitive system that you're

1566
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
analyzing which is also a physical

1567
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,800
system

1568
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,079
how is it that those could represent um

1569
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,800
the probabilities that are assigned by

1570
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,400
that system to

1571
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,839
the external states right um so

1572
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,960
so the idea of a transparent uh

1573
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,319
neuronal code or any code uh is is just

1574
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,839
that the probability

1575
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,079
of for example so in the on the left

1576
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,880
hand of the diagram here

1577
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,400
if we had a transparent code in the

1578
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,480
sense in which i'm using that term

1579
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,640
then for example the probability of

1580
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
neuron b

1581
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,440
firing given that neuron a fire is right

1582
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,520
so if b is postsynaptic

1583
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,800
neuron and a sends a signal to b or a a

1584
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
fires and uh there's a certain

1585
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,640
probability of b firing subsequent to a

1586
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,359
firing

1587
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,960
that would represent uh the probability

1588
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,480
of some state of affairs q

1589
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
obtaining given that some state of

1590
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,520
affairs p obtains

1591
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,800
where a and this we can we can talk

1592
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,520
about

1593
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,359
where this mapping comes from right but

1594
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,119
the assumption is a

1595
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,480
represents p occurring and b represents

1596
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,839
q occurring

1597
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,200
um so so that's really all i meant by a

1598
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,880
transparent code and it's it's not

1599
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,400
it's a simple idea but it's it's

1600
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,000
definitely controversial right like

1601
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,480
that that would mean that if you think

1602
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,680
that there's a certain conditional

1603
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,520
probability of

1604
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,119
you know the cat being on the mat given

1605
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,800
that the cat

1606
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,119
lives in the apartment um then

1607
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,440
sort of the probability that you would

1608
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,400
represent those things has to be tied up

1609
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,440
with the probability that you assign

1610
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,119
uh to those things occurring and that's

1611
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,720
not at all a

1612
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,480
sort of um uncontroversial statement

1613
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,440
um but it's a simple idea and this is an

1614
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:19,839
idea

1615
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,280
by the way again that's that's used in

1616
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,400
some of the early connectionist

1617
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,280
literature

1618
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,400
um on um blue mentioned um

1619
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,920
boltzmann machines right so there's an

1620
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,240
early paper on both both of the machines

1621
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,480
uh where this kind of stochastic code is

1622
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,160
proposed

1623
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,599
and the basic one more sentence on this

1624
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,760
the basic idea is that the objective

1625
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,480
probability

1626
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,319
sort of measurable probability of events

1627
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,839
within the system

1628
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,000
uh maps onto the subjective probability

1629
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,319
that the system assigns to

1630
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,359
the states of affairs that are

1631
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,359
represented by those internal states

1632
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,839
interesting and in the context of the

1633
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,040
cognitive

1634
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,119
system of interest we're talking about

1635
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,480
the brain

1636
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,079
it's like we know that we're not going

1637
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,760
to get the transparent coding

1638
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,720
from the photons hitting the retina to

1639
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,480
what is the probability of

1640
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,440
the cat being on the mat so with this

1641
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,040
multi-level

1642
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,119
processing as you've kind of hinted at

1643
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,880
with the multiple layers here

1644
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,119
it could be possible that at some

1645
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,640
neuronal stage or

1646
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,960
at some level of processing there is

1647
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,240
a pattern that maybe represents

1648
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,520
the cat being on the mat

1649
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,079
probabilistically which also invoked the

1650
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,680
whole representation

1651
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,160
questions which we had talked about

1652
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,520
months ago

1653
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,559
um right so it's so fun to see how you

1654
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,599
you delineated where there's controversy

1655
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,680
sometimes even both sides of the

1656
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,920
discussion around a controversy

1657
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,680
and then it's like great here's the

1658
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,200
artifact let's see which way we're gonna

1659
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,920
push it

1660
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,520
if there turns out to be more evidence

1661
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,200
for transparent coding

1662
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
then we'll push it that way and if there

1663
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,480
turns out to be less then we can push it

1664
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,839
a different way

1665
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,280
so um scott uh if you're

1666
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,440
there i don't see you yet so stephen

1667
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,640
first and then

1668
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,319
okay stop scott go ahead and then

1669
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,079
stephen um

1670
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,359
i just wanted to mention there was an

1671
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,119
article in nature a couple of years ago

1672
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,040
where there was an assertion made that

1673
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,440
consciousness this is what caught my eye

1674
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,160
consciousness they asserted arose 520

1675
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,440
million years ago

1676
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,720
and they and i was like well that's

1677
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,319
interesting what's the evidence and what

1678
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,040
they found

1679
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,440
was some structures for i think they

1680
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,160
were proto-nodo cords or something

1681
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,160
but basically it was a ganglia kind of

1682
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,599
thing a secondary

1683
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,880
processing and their assertion was that

1684
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,920
because they found

1685
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,200
physical evidence of a neuronal

1686
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,000
structure

1687
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,440
again in in fossils it was some

1688
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,839
eddie karen are able to be preserved in

1689
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,040
shale or something

1690
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,319
but um uh that because it was secondary

1691
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,400
processing beyond the

1692
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,200
the eyeball or the ear or the perception

1693
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,160
apparatus

1694
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,480
that secondary processing they suggested

1695
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,319
meant there was

1696
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,240
consciousness because that was their

1697
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,079
definition but it was interesting

1698
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,640
the reason i raised it here is it's

1699
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,599
interesting that notion of embodiment

1700
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,119
right so we're talking again let's talk

1701
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,359
about reaction chambers we have

1702
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,000
there's stimuli all over the world

1703
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,200
there's things happening

1704
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
and then we have perceptions ability to

1705
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,559
detect stimuli

1706
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,960
right in our afford it to us and so

1707
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,520
that comes in but we don't have the

1708
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,880
structure of it is

1709
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,640
tbd right and so then we the the

1710
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,960
the organism embodies morphologically

1711
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,920
certain structures over time eyeballs

1712
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,319
and

1713
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,400
notochords and ganglia and things like

1714
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,000
that right

1715
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,359
and those themselves are information

1716
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:50,480
structures they just haven't even

1717
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,000
embodied in a morphology so it's

1718
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,079
morphological computing for biological

1719
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,000
organism right because they now can do

1720
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,079
that thing i can't see an ultraviolet

1721
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,839
but bees can that kind of thing or

1722
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,640
infrared that kind of thing um so it's

1723
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,640
so i just wanted to raise that idea

1724
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,079
that assertion that offended me

1725
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,160
originally that consciousness arose 520

1726
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,359
million years ago

1727
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,000
is not so offensive in a way because

1728
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
what they're trying to do is grope at

1729
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,480
the notion

1730
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,040
of the layering on of morphology and

1731
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,559
embodiments

1732
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,799
and say look there here was a ratchet

1733
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,000
here's something happened

1734
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,599
here and we think we don't know how much

1735
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,359
more experience it's like julian james

1736
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,280
when he went back and did the

1737
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,559
origin of consciousness and the

1738
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,319
evolution of the bicameral mind book in

1739
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,720
the 70s

1740
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,240
j-a-y-n-e-s and he was asserting from a

1741
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,680
literature search

1742
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,040
that the wernicke's area flashed on

1743
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,559
at one point it was equivalent to

1744
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,160
broca's area language center in the

1745
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,359
other side of the brain

1746
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,040
and his literature search he looked at

1747
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,040
joan of arc he looked at the iliad

1748
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,599
and he said that morphologically

1749
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,319
literature

1750
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,520
embodied that notion of the mind

1751
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,400
actually changing

1752
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,119
ancient literature can see the mind

1753
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,960
turning on that internal voice and so i

1754
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,400
just wanted to raise that

1755
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,200
notion those embodiments of the external

1756
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,480
and internal states

1757
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,040
lying around all over the place right

1758
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,760
and so

1759
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,240
it's your paper does a nice job of

1760
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,839
inviting

1761
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,280
the um treatment of those or those

1762
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,000
those as candidates for looking at the

1763
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,839
mind being assembled particularly

1764
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,559
if the mind is external to the brain and

1765
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,480
the brain is just an antenna tuned into

1766
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,040
the mind

1767
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,640
thanks one one funny little

1768
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,559
synchronicity there is that

1769
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,960
uh julian janes wrote the book that

1770
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,480
scott mentioned

1771
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,160
origin of consciousness in the breakdown

1772
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,599
of the bicameral mind

1773
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,280
but edwin janes was a very famous

1774
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,400
thermodynamics

1775
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,880
researcher who introduced the maximum

1776
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,680
entropy

1777
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,960
interpretation of thermodynamics so

1778
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,359
related like we all are bi were they

1779
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,079
related

1780
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,799
were they related by cons the blood

1781
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,160
aren't we all

1782
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,040
yeah oh come

1783
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,520
yeah just sort of coming to this diagram

1784
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,280
that you've got here um

1785
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,599
so i think um one thing i'd be

1786
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,480
interested in

1787
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,319
unless you say neuronal or other

1788
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,640
internal systemic states so you sort of

1789
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,200
give

1790
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,520
a little bit of latitude to dynamical

1791
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,799
aspects of that

1792
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,720
goes to cognitive states of the system

1793
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,839
beliefs

1794
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,880
and i'm wondering how much

1795
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,400
you're tied to those beliefs being

1796
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,760
um statistical computational

1797
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,119
sort of separate things or how much is

1798
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:37,359
it

1799
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,079
beliefs on action policies i mean i know

1800
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,000
i'm pushing active information again but

1801
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,520
yeah it's you know it's fun

1802
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,079
yeah what's your thoughts on that yeah i

1803
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,960
mean

1804
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,079
there's all sorts of questions here

1805
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,839
about how we individuate representations

1806
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:50,640
and such but

1807
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,000
i wouldn't think i don't even i don't

1808
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,760
really think of these as detachable

1809
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,720
uh separate entities at all so that node

1810
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,839
is labeled p

1811
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,599
but i'm one of these functionalists who

1812
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,880
thinks that the reason that

1813
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,640
the label itself does nothing right the

1814
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
reason the the label is a useful

1815
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,520
indicator for people outside the system

1816
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,240
to understand

1817
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,680
what it represents but the

1818
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,280
representational function is just the

1819
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,920
role that that node plays in the network

1820
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,640
so um um and that would i think that it

1821
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,720
subsumes and includes um

1822
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,799
connections to action right i just tend

1823
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,559
to think of connections to action as

1824
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,240
the special case where what you're

1825
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,920
generating what your generative model is

1826
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,440
generating are states of the motor

1827
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,720
effectors

1828
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,839
so right i just and i think any any kind

1829
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:32,720
of planning

1830
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,160
um that that that the organism learns to

1831
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,720
do

1832
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,400
can also be understood as learning sort

1833
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,160
of sensory motor contingencies which

1834
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,880
will

1835
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,839
influence how states of the motor

1836
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,720
effectors are

1837
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,799
generated in tandem with states of the

1838
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:47,920
perceptual system

1839
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,480
right how perceptual biases occur so um

1840
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,839
basically yeah i don't think that

1841
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,440
that there's any like these don't need

1842
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,119
to be cognitive separable

1843
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,359
features of the these don't need to be

1844
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,799
separable features of the system they're

1845
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,520
just

1846
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,920
like when i say that a state represents

1847
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,559
p

1848
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,039
um because i'm represents for me has

1849
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,559
sort of a functionalist meaning

1850
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,319
i just mean that's just sort of a label

1851
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,000
for uh

1852
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,520
a set of uh ways in which the system can

1853
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,000
behave

1854
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,680
because of its internal structure so

1855
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,920
including sort of internal

1856
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,720
um dynamics right but it's really just a

1857
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,520
label for

1858
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,480
a property of the dynamics of the system

1859
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:28,960
cool

1860
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,160
and also beyond the action being at the

1861
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:32,880
gross

1862
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,520
organismal motor level potentially

1863
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,240
internal

1864
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,000
representations or states could be like

1865
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,400
hormonal or neurosecretory

1866
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,720
so the neuron can fire but neurons have

1867
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,160
other affordances

1868
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,559
like the little micro motor behavior

1869
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,480
with the motor proteins like releasing a

1870
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,440
vesicle

1871
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,640
of of a protein that's been transcribed

1872
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,440
and translated

1873
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,400
also tiny little motor behaviors of

1874
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:56,960
nested

1875
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,520
smaller agents inside of that neuronal

1876
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,559
interface

1877
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,240
so stephen and then anyone else with a

1878
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,640
raised hand

1879
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,760
actually just what you were saying there

1880
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,039
daniel does that mean that you can

1881
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,480
almost

1882
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,400
release hormones through the brain it

1883
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,160
doesn't have to be like through a gland

1884
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,680
in the body but you've got

1885
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,920
smaller scale releases

1886
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,039
neurosecretory cells and neuroendocrine

1887
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,559
biology are large areas so yes

1888
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,680
many kinds of cells pull in and secrete

1889
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,200
molecules and neurons are of various

1890
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,240
subtypes

1891
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,880
secreting specific hormones

1892
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,640
neuropeptides all kinds of hormones

1893
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,720
and signaling molecules short range and

1894
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,039
into the circulation

1895
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,039
okay thanks um and i let that process

1896
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,319
and that's really useful i didn't know

1897
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:46,960
about that

1898
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,559
and um i supposed just adding on to this

1899
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,839
you you when you mentioned about sensory

1900
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,520
motor contingencies and

1901
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,240
and and being able to um so i'm

1902
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,079
wondering that the scale

1903
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,119
of um consciousness

1904
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,400
you know and things entering into

1905
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,240
consciousness or the phenomenological

1906
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,079
sort of awareness

1907
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,319
do you sense that there may be even if

1908
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,280
active inference is under writing it all

1909
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,640
some other types of like it doesn't have

1910
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,640
to be as pure active inference at that

1911
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,079
scale

1912
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,280
and it could be working with other types

1913
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,599
of

1914
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,079
sort of architectures or process

1915
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,920
architectures

1916
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,480
uh i mean well one thing is that

1917
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,680
consciousness

1918
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,520
so i think scott brought up

1919
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,119
consciousness for the first time here

1920
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,319
that's really interesting i um i sort of

1921
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,680
deliberately didn't say anything about

1922
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,000
it in my paper because i find that it's

1923
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
um it's a very thorny topic for me of

1924
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,240
course for many people right

1925
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,000
it's not it's not notoriously not an

1926
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,920
easy problem or maybe it is and it looks

1927
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,440
like a hard problem but anyway

1928
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,119
um yeah so so i'm not sure i i do think

1929
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:55,839
that like

1930
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,280
all of the cognitive dynamics i'm

1931
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,880
talking about are probably more

1932
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,680
fine-grained

1933
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,839
than what shows up in consciousness so i

1934
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:02,799
wouldn't say that there's some

1935
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,559
transparent mapping from

1936
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,319
whatever you believe in in the sense of

1937
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,079
belief that's implicitly defined

1938
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,319
here and what you are consciously aware

1939
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,200
of

1940
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,760
um i so we can there's all sorts of

1941
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,039
theories of how consciousness

1942
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,319
relates to this stuff um

1943
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,440
there was a second piece to what you

1944
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,680
said that i wanted to address but i

1945
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,240
don't remember

1946
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,559
what it was well i suppose there's a

1947
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,480
scale but i think you kind of addressed

1948
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,599
it a little bit there

1949
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,039
sorry daniel you're gonna say yeah we'll

1950
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:30,720
we'll come back to it if you

1951
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,200
remember what it was yeah scott and then

1952
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,799
anyone else with a raised hand

1953
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,799
yeah i wanted to go back to the notion

1954
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,559
of neurotransmitters from a minute ago

1955
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,680
when you're talking about endocrine

1956
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,559
neural function

1957
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:41,599
a couple of things there's a couple of

1958
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,039
books here just want to hold up this

1959
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:43,760
cognitive

1960
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,960
um cognitive archaeological

1961
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,880
the cognitive archaeology and human

1962
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,640
evolution kind of an interesting notion

1963
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,240
there's a couple authors there

1964
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,559
here's another one archaeology and

1965
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,480
memory kind of an interesting one

1966
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,160
the reason i raise these is kind of

1967
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,799
interesting when you talk about

1968
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,319
neurotransmitters i remember reading an

1969
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,760
article a few years ago

1970
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,079
that suggested that among all the

1971
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,760
animals in the animal kingdom now the

1972
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,039
animal kingdom is an old

1973
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,960
representation corollas linnaeus thing i

1974
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,559
get it but in any event

1975
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,880
um there's only one animal that doesn't

1976
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,480
share any of the neurotransmitters or

1977
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,920
the rest of the animals like the box

1978
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,520
jellyfish or some kind of jellyfish i

1979
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,039
forget which one it was

1980
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,319
and i thought that was interesting just

1981
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,440
what we were just talking about a minute

1982
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,880
ago daniel was noting about

1983
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,920
neurotransmitters

1984
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,680
well again it's morphological computing

1985
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,200
those are artifacts

1986
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,640
of earlier solutions their practices

1987
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,799
of processing of information by these

1988
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,000
organisms right

1989
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,319
and so the fact that we can go back and

1990
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,119
say

1991
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,440
wow i wonder if these things were

1992
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,280
related given the fact that these don't

1993
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,880
share any neurotransmitters that's kind

1994
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,039
of an ethereal element it's not

1995
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,960
something that you get like bones and

1996
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,960
you know it doesn't fossilize well

1997
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,400
but isn't it interesting that we can

1998
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,079
find the morphology of neurotransmission

1999
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,839
in current organisms and use that to

2000
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:58,559
understand

2001
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,400
lineage and relationship so in fact

2002
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,240
that's a it's a morphological artifact

2003
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,000
and it's not epigenetic

2004
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,599
right but it's interesting the

2005
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,520
relationship of

2006
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,240
the the uh homeostatic state of

2007
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,880
uh thinking the cognition of a certain

2008
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,559
line of organisms

2009
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,920
and the morphology of its

2010
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,200
neurotransmitters

2011
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,079
i'm interested in you social insects for

2012
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,119
instance

2013
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,599
do people do profiles if anybody here

2014
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,119
knows anything about you social insects

2015
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,079
please type in

2016
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,039
the um do they what's the story with

2017
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:39,599
neurotransmitter

2018
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,559
analysis among you social insects is

2019
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,440
that a special

2020
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,359
neurotransmitter specially invoked and

2021
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,039
is the morphology of neurotransmitters

2022
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:47,839
perhaps

2023
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,640
where the organism resides more than

2024
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,839
other physicalities

2025
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,720
thanks great great question scott so

2026
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,359
first on the

2027
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,680
tina four point and then the eu social

2028
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,440
so um the tina four indeed

2029
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,680
it did suggest new evolutionary

2030
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,960
hypotheses

2031
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,680
when people investigated which

2032
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,520
neurotransmitters tenoforms used

2033
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,440
and they convergently utilized some of

2034
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,640
the same simple

2035
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,200
charged amino acid derivatives but they

2036
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,880
use them in different ways for example

2037
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,839
glutamate

2038
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,399
is not used in muscle contraction in

2039
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,279
vertebrates

2040
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,319
we have acetylcholinergic receptors at

2041
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,198
the muscle

2042
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,679
but glutamate was used which supports

2043
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:26,479
alex's

2044
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,319
point about functional representation

2045
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,679
there's nothing that says

2046
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,000
glutamate means muscle contraction it's

2047
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,880
a functional

2048
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
context with a receptor and a muscle

2049
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,479
cell and a neuron that generates the

2050
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,600
contraction

2051
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,080
and potentially for a later day maybe

2052
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,040
when we discuss

2053
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,000
active inference the paper but um we've

2054
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,679
done multiple studies measuring

2055
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,799
neurotransmitter

2056
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,000
metabolism and gene expression in ants

2057
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,439
and there's been a lot of work on

2058
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,319
honeybees as well and just the one

2059
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,238
point i'll make here since it is a large

2060
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,759
area and people can look at the papers

2061
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,799
if they want

2062
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,120
is that the neurotransmitters that are

2063
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,839
involved in the regulation of foraging

2064
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,880
in ants and bees are inherited

2065
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,359
from the neurotransmitters that regulate

2066
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,198
foraging and solitary insects

2067
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,759
like dopamine and octopamine in fruit

2068
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,359
flies where it's been investigated in

2069
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,839
the context of solitary foraging

2070
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,238
but the inputs and the outputs of

2071
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,040
foraging

2072
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,880
for the eu social insects are different

2073
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,080
so whereas in

2074
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,158
drosophila it's like internal hunger

2075
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,399
signals representations maybe some sort

2076
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,600
of neural hormonal

2077
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,960
encoding leads to foraging behavior

2078
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,479
and then that results in the acquisition

2079
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,399
of food that re-enters that bodily

2080
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,279
system

2081
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,319
but an ant forager is foraging

2082
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,479
essentially food for the larvae a

2083
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,198
different part of the colony organism

2084
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,479
so the inputs like the stimuli that lead

2085
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,238
to induced foraging behavior and the

2086
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,399
outputs like where the food goes

2087
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,560
are different but the foraging motor

2088
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,920
behavior is conserved

2089
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,080
and it's that rewiring of the motor

2090
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,320
motif of foraging

2091
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,159
via the same neurotransmitters

2092
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,239
octopamine and dopamine and others

2093
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,400
that actually enable the colony life

2094
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
cycle so it's a really awesome area i

2095
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,120
hope we can

2096
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,560
talk more about how that relates to

2097
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,159
active inference

2098
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,800
so um stephen and then scott and then

2099
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,000
anyone else who raises their hands

2100
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,600
yeah i'd like to ask a question

2101
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,360
about which sort of links to that it's a

2102
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,679
it's a kind of a semi theory i've got

2103
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,400
but

2104
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,520
is it feasible with this that the brain

2105
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,760
like an organism basically the cells

2106
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,440
that become the brain

2107
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,640
effectively they mutate and they they

2108
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,360
transform into the unique form that the

2109
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,800
the brain and the nervous system

2110
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,719
basically like another organism growing

2111
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,480
into the main

2112
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,960
organism right so you've got two

2113
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,280
organisms once they differentiate

2114
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,239
and their brain is like the control and

2115
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:52,560
the

2116
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,840
nervous system is like the control

2117
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,560
organization growing into

2118
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,560
and with the other the fascia of the

2119
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,159
other organism well in a human fascia

2120
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,199
but obviously

2121
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,719
i just wondered if that would be

2122
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,880
plausible and that that would do

2123
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,800
anything with this brain

2124
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,760
organism boundary question that i know

2125
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,239
you

2126
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,280
are kind of connected to in terms of

2127
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,120
wanting to maybe maintain more of that

2128
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,320
potential

2129
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,440
i don't know if that's something that

2130
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,280
other people have talked about or

2131
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,800
whether it's a little bit out there

2132
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,520
and just um yeah biologically or

2133
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,000
from the sort of cognitive philosophical

2134
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,520
sense how that pans out

2135
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,520
yeah yeah i love i love the like

2136
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,760
biology and biochemistry and stuff and

2137
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,880
all this

2138
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,520
you know wonderful fine grain scientific

2139
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,640
um

2140
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,080
life sciences stuff that you guys are

2141
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,920
bringing to the table on this um that's

2142
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,440
that's not as much where i'm coming from

2143
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,199
but i think it's really really cool

2144
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,199
um but so so that steve the idea that

2145
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,120
you just articulated sounds

2146
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,840
sounds out there and plausible to me so

2147
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,600
um i think that like

2148
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,199
uh that's kind of what i would expect

2149
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,880
is that this same story can be told on

2150
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,960
multiple scales internal to the system

2151
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,520
right and so the brain learning sort of

2152
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,080
learning

2153
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,440
growing uh i guess

2154
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,960
i've just been conditioned to think of

2155
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,400
all this as one type of process right so

2156
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,239
i said learning but

2157
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,000
morphological development and growing

2158
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,280
into its into its

2159
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,920
um mature shape is a form of learning

2160
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,440
but so anyway um

2161
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,040
that happening and interfacing with the

2162
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,520
rest of the organism um

2163
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,120
i mean i definitely don't see any reason

2164
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,280
that we need to draw a like

2165
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,080
joint joint in nature around the

2166
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,800
physically

2167
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,480
right the organism that we can perceive

2168
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,840
there are going to be many similar

2169
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,960
joints that we could

2170
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,840
delineate within so um i think that's a

2171
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,640
cool idea

2172
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,080
i don't know much about the details of

2173
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,000
that process so i can't like

2174
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,440
check that validate it but it sounds

2175
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,120
plausible to me

2176
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,599
thanks alex blue and then scott

2177
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,880
so just to kind of maybe um ask steven

2178
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,040
to unpack a little bit what he said so

2179
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,239
i think um in terms of like a

2180
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,760
brain organism like separation or

2181
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,719
duality like

2182
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,199
do you maybe mean like mind organism

2183
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,159
because as

2184
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:13,920
like in my experience it's like the um

2185
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,199
like the brain is like the control

2186
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,719
center right like i don't know that

2187
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,000
there's necessarily like a

2188
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,400
division between the brain and the and

2189
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,000
the organism but definitely like the

2190
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,400
mind is kind of like this ethereal

2191
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,080
concept so maybe could you just unpack

2192
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,520
that a little bit

2193
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,760
well i was actually thinking partly

2194
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,159
thinking about the work of mike levin

2195
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,920
um mike levine or mike levin and um

2196
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,400
so in a way i my understanding is that

2197
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,280
once a cell becomes a neuronal cell

2198
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,679
if there's no going back like it's kind

2199
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,400
of

2200
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,400
like it so it's in some ways it's um

2201
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,199
it's it's i was curious whether that

2202
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:51,679
whole

2203
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,800
structure be it from a small organism

2204
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,760
is effectively like we basically have

2205
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,239
two organisms in our body

2206
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,640
because our cells have differentiated

2207
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,920
into the body

2208
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,239
organisms and the neuronal ones and

2209
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,040
they've sort of

2210
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,719
they they work together in this

2211
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,480
symbiotic kind of

2212
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,920
cybernetic loop so that that's the kind

2213
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,800
of thinking

2214
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,640
um about how it pans out i'm you know

2215
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,640
so i just if i could just like speak to

2216
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,920
that a little bit um

2217
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,080
so the neurons can de-differentiate and

2218
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,679
do um in like especially like in neural

2219
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,880
cancer types

2220
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,520
so we do see some some d differentiation

2221
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,760
there it's not as committal as we've

2222
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,400
thought before i mean this it's kind of

2223
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,760
a budding field and the

2224
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,440
the you know antique way of thinking is

2225
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,239
that there is

2226
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,000
it's a set lineage but there's there's

2227
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,360
ways that you can convince them to do

2228
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,080
otherwise

2229
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,880
i think mike levin's thing is the

2230
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,840
bioelectric

2231
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,960
field right and so so he separates the

2232
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,239
the bioelectricity

2233
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:00,480
of the organism as as maybe

2234
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,080
the overarching control center there but

2235
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,320
i've not seen like a neural

2236
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,120
um phys like a neuron body distinction

2237
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,000
that's why i was just like

2238
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,880
what sorry well one thought on that and

2239
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,400
also to scott's point about the

2240
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,159
emergence of a second level of the

2241
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,520
nervous system

2242
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,679
is to remember from developmental

2243
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,040
biology that

2244
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,159
ectoderm the outer layer of the

2245
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:26,280
developing embryo turns into

2246
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,600
neuroectoderm

2247
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,199
which is the tissue that gives rise to

2248
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,199
the nervous system and gastrulation in

2249
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,080
the neural tube

2250
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,719
so the nervous system developmentally

2251
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:35,679
neurons

2252
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,640
share um an affinity and a developmental

2253
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,600
proximity

2254
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,239
to the external layer and so when you

2255
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,040
start nesting

2256
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,760
internal layers inside of that tube

2257
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,199
that's closed

2258
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,440
you start getting higher order nervous

2259
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,320
systems

2260
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
and then also the pituitary gland to

2261
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,960
sort of close this with a neuroendocrine

2262
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,679
discussion the pituitary gland is

2263
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,320
actually

2264
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,440
um amalgamated from multiple

2265
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,840
developmental sources and so it's

2266
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,080
interesting that it has such a pivotal

2267
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,280
hormonal position integrating hormones

2268
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,000
and the brain's function and it itself

2269
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,400
is like

2270
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,840
a re-fusion from a tissue perspective

2271
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,400
of multiple branches of the ectoderm

2272
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:18,960
that had

2273
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,280
branched and then they reformulate a new

2274
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,760
organ which is the pituitary gland

2275
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,080
that serves a very coordinating role in

2276
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,400
organismal development

2277
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,400
so scott and then anyone else with the

2278
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,560
question

2279
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,640
you know this is the best way i can

2280
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,600
spend my day

2281
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
with people who say the quote the

2282
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,520
pituitary gland is amalgamated from

2283
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,040
multiple ectoderm sources

2284
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,960
there i'm in the right place man you

2285
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,480
know when you you know

2286
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,280
you know this is the place for me i can

2287
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,239
tell you that

2288
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,320
hey um a couple things let's go back to

2289
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,560
this part in holland dynamic and cancer

2290
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,320
as an organism stuff for a second this

2291
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,920
is uh this is good stuff

2292
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,840
so you know the cancer analysis where

2293
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,440
they start to treat cancer

2294
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,520
as an organism in an ecosystem you know

2295
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,840
some of the framings to think of it that

2296
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,159
way a recruitment of a kind of chaotic

2297
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,679
kind of like having a drunk uncle stay

2298
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,520
at your house is one way of looking at

2299
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,520
cancer right it's a it's a chaotic use

2300
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,719
of resources

2301
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,080
um so that is kind of interesting right

2302
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,800
because

2303
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,320
so we're talking and going back to

2304
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,679
steven's point about the mind being

2305
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:20,239
different

2306
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,880
so i'm thinking of symbiogenesis here

2307
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,880
lynn margulis stuff and the chloroplast

2308
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,199
in all plant cells and the mitochondria

2309
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:30,640
and all animal cells were once

2310
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,320
their artifacts of once pre-existing

2311
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,000
bacteria right they migrated on board

2312
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,440
with eukaryotes because it was a better

2313
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,560
deal

2314
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,880
right more leverage more de-risking

2315
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,320
higher levels of engagement with the

2316
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,920
outside right they change their internal

2317
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,120
physicality

2318
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,199
and morphology so they could think at

2319
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,719
way higher levels they could

2320
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,040
access way more complex levels of

2321
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:49,920
engagement

2322
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,120
than single cell organisms including the

2323
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,320
engagements they could get through

2324
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,840
sexual reproduction which introduced

2325
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,159
additional symbolic novelty so they

2326
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,239
could be more dynamically engaged with

2327
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,080
environments right clonal reproduction

2328
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,920
does not introduce a lot of novelty

2329
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,080
so it's hard to keep up with dynamic

2330
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,000
environments if you're formal

2331
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,360
this is something like intelligent

2332
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,440
design but it's not so

2333
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,440
it's interesting steven in your notion

2334
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,880
of the mind being

2335
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,239
separate because in a way the mind is

2336
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,120
formed

2337
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,520
by the social environment you know i've

2338
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,040
told the story before my sister

2339
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,880
adopting a five-month-old chinese child

2340
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,320
who is now 22

2341
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,000
who is raised in central pennsylvania

2342
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,440
speaks spanish and english does not

2343
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,199
speak chinese does not like chinese food

2344
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,880
does not like chinese music

2345
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,080
and basically looks like a chinese

2346
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,920
person but is not so

2347
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,800
is that mind a chinese mind the problem

2348
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,960
is we don't get have any control groups

2349
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,880
on the mind formation right once you're

2350
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,960
formed you are who you are

2351
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,199
and we say okay that's it but i'd like

2352
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,600
steven where you're going on that notion

2353
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,520
maybe the mind is an independent

2354
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,960
quantity and

2355
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,199
again the brain is an antenna to the

2356
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,280
mind so maybe the body

2357
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,440
contains the antenna components again i

2358
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,600
don't mean a real antenna but sort of

2359
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,800
um and it contained it needs to be tuned

2360
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,239
it's feral and so maybe what's happening

2361
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,159
is the tuning actually creates

2362
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,640
a mind maybe the mind is not resident in

2363
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,600
the brain

2364
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,520
in a child and maybe bayesian inferences

2365
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,960
construct a mind

2366
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,640
and to maybe direct it to alex before we

2367
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,000
go to steven's question

2368
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,760
dean you really focused on this sentence

2369
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,679
it may be for example that biological

2370
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,120
systems

2371
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,960
run an algorithm closer to of divergence

2372
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,080
than to simulated annealing so what does

2373
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,719
that

2374
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,080
mean or what what does that reflect

2375
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,280
on can i indeed maybe

2376
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,360
give a little extra info on that just

2377
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,960
just a quick quick thing

2378
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,800
i want i want to hear stephen and i want

2379
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,560
to hear everybody else

2380
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,280
but i have a question in the background

2381
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,560
sorry i have to say this in the

2382
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,080
background i've got people taking the

2383
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,520
front of my house off

2384
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,840
so i haven't been able to do much other

2385
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,000
than try to control my add

2386
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,800
but i have a big question for alex once

2387
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,159
we get through the

2388
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,400
the part that stephen and scott want to

2389
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,360
have addressing it's

2390
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,520
specifically to what you just raised so

2391
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,400
thank you

2392
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,239
great let's go to steven and then we'll

2393
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,639
return to dean and the contrast of

2394
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,960
divergence

2395
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,239
yeah maybe this will bring this together

2396
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,360
is i suppose what i'm just

2397
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,199
proposing is is that there is some

2398
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:37,280
structural biological differentiation

2399
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,480
which is will have an impact

2400
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,960
in some ways and how we think about

2401
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,800
extended cognition

2402
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,840
but if we i i'm very much of

2403
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,120
the mind body

2404
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,600
environment dynamical system kind of

2405
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,560
idea

2406
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,520
so i suppose i'm i'm talking about there

2407
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,840
being a difference

2408
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,000
biologically but probably at the macro

2409
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,040
level i'm

2410
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,199
i'm trying anyway to formulate

2411
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,719
approaches which talk about a whole

2412
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:07,280
system

2413
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,600
and not anything else than that but i

2414
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,800
recognize that

2415
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,600
it may open up some other cans of worms

2416
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,320
but

2417
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,440
um i i know that how i wonder if that's

2418
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,239
something that you're

2419
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:22,239
does this does this annealing relate to

2420
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,960
the mind-body environment dynamic in

2421
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,960
playing out within that or is

2422
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,400
is it a little bit more separate or

2423
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,840
different to that

2424
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,960
yeah i mean the the use i was making of

2425
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,600
this

2426
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,679
contrast between contrast to divergence

2427
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,840
and simulated annealing here is

2428
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,880
was just was kind of more specific

2429
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,280
um i was just thinking of

2430
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,120
so annealing this process of of

2431
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,880
gradually lowering the temperature

2432
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,120
and simulated annealing was a

2433
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,880
optimization technique that mirrors that

2434
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,679
process

2435
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,560
and um so i mean i guess the answer to

2436
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,000
your question stephen is i

2437
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,080
i wasn't really thinking about system

2438
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,600
environment relations here at all i was

2439
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,360
just thinking of um

2440
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,080
two different sort of internal processes

2441
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,159
and how they might be mapped on to

2442
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,960
um onto these these uh learning

2443
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,639
algorithms and processes and physics but

2444
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:15,360
so

2445
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,920
so i mean i can wait to go on to that to

2446
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,880
take dean's

2447
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,480
question or yeah or whatever maybe

2448
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,040
let's uh let's go for the divergence

2449
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,520
yeah

2450
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,800
i i'm not predictable

2451
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,560
um i'm going to pull up the paper

2452
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,560
because i need to uh

2453
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,360
explain this so alex in the paper you

2454
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,480
you

2455
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,560
you talked in in the subsection one two

2456
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,480
the role of internal energy

2457
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,840
um let me just find it here

2458
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,239
you talked about the inverse

2459
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,760
relationship between probability and

2460
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,040
energy

2461
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,199
is exploded and most uses of energy as a

2462
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,239
cost function

2463
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,080
and optimization problems so you made

2464
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,840
that clear

2465
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,120
and then a little further down in the

2466
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,679
paper you talked about contrastive

2467
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,440
divergence which in equilibrium

2468
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,280
distribution of a restricted boltzmann

2469
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,239
machine

2470
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,679
and then you got into a little bit more

2471
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,920
about the the comparison is

2472
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,400
the simulated annealing and then you got

2473
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,480
into section two

2474
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,239
and i'm just going to try to find it

2475
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,639
here the ensemble piece

2476
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,320
so here's my here's my question

2477
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,320
um if i were to bring a um

2478
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,639
if i already bring three things and and

2479
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:27,760
cast the widest

2480
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,040
largest wrist and blanket yet around

2481
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,000
your paper

2482
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,600
because i think that's what your paper

2483
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,719
does if i were to bring a polaroid

2484
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,560
picture a sprinkler and an astronaut

2485
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,840
together so if i were to bring

2486
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,040
identity which is what was the primary

2487
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,560
attractor of your paper to me

2488
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,600
identity astronaut that

2489
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,800
that distribution piece and

2490
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
um the first one the

2491
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,199
the the polaroid the isomorphism

2492
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,760
could you explain how you you brought

2493
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,080
these things that are so

2494
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,199
seemingly um distal

2495
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,560
into some sort of a coherence how how

2496
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,400
did when you were sitting down because i

2497
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,000
know you did this on a very

2498
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,320
proximal level but it it has far

2499
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,400
reaching implications based on the

2500
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,560
kinds of questions that stephen has

2501
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,560
asked the ones that scott's asked the

2502
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,360
points that

2503
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,600
lou and daniel have made it it doesn't

2504
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,120
just seem to be local

2505
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,280
it seems to be really distributed as

2506
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,040
well and so

2507
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,320
i'm just really curious you wrote the

2508
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,000
paper but now that you've kind of been

2509
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,719
able to

2510
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,880
step back from it and sort of take it

2511
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,320
into perspective

2512
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,639
that distance must have you really

2513
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,920
really looking at this maybe maybe in uh

2514
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,440
interesting ways because there isn't

2515
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,080
just the stuff on the paper

2516
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,600
there's the stuff now that you've kind

2517
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,239
of reflected on and seen the inversion

2518
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:01,199
and and wondered holy macro did i open

2519
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,480
up a can of worms or

2520
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,480
what did i what have i done i'm just i'm

2521
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,880
curious about that on a personal level

2522
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,719
right um well just i mean in general

2523
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,440
my the most striking thing about how

2524
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,800
this has played out

2525
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,600
um is that people are really interested

2526
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,080
um so

2527
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,159
blue mentioned this in the discussion

2528
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,120
and um

2529
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,280
i had emails about it too are really

2530
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,040
interested in the distinction between

2531
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:29,199
um genuine minds and like simulations

2532
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,520
um which was completely an afterthought

2533
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,400
when i wrote this

2534
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
it was just like oh yeah i better deal

2535
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,840
with the scope of this and so i should

2536
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,360
put a sentence about that and

2537
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,600
i did put care into it you know i i put

2538
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,960
the best sentence i could and but

2539
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,960
it wasn't my focus but um

2540
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,320
yeah the i mean the the

2541
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,719
the the thing i guess the thing that

2542
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,320
that strikes me about this so it was it

2543
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,280
was

2544
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,960
right i mean it was intended to be this

2545
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,400
it was it was intended to be a very

2546
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,920
fundamental like thesis that i'm

2547
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,120
considering here so

2548
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,159
i do think it has far reaching

2549
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,480
implications i have no idea whether it's

2550
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,120
true but

2551
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,800
right if it did it would have at least

2552
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,400
far-reaching implications i guess what

2553
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,679
i'm

2554
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,159
um what i'm less clear on is well i i

2555
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,840
i'm still i'm still waiting for the

2556
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,880
other shoe to drop i'm waiting for

2557
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,320
someone to say here's an example of a

2558
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,679
biological system in which

2559
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:20,960
there's no way that you can map the

2560
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,360
cognitive interpretation directly onto

2561
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,800
the physical interpretation

2562
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,520
because um if that's the case and if i

2563
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,280
think if it's a compelling example then

2564
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,080
then i guess i'm wrong so far so far

2565
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,120
that hasn't happened there have been

2566
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,880
some interesting suggestions

2567
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,679
um but so so i guess i'm i don't know if

2568
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:38,800
i'm directly answering

2569
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,840
your question or dean i'm just

2570
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,080
um to me the the the devil is still very

2571
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,120
much in the details and

2572
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,120
this is essentially a defense of a pop i

2573
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,280
was trying to

2574
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,120
i was trying to show that maybe some

2575
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,120
some a priyary

2576
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,280
prima facie objections to this kind of

2577
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,040
thesis were not

2578
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,080
uh you know were not compelling

2579
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,480
but there could be all sorts of details

2580
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,639
that merge that

2581
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,800
that might question it um

2582
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,239
so i don't know if that really answers

2583
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,400
your question i'm sorry no no it

2584
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,000
and again it was kind of like when i was

2585
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,520
talking with blue and

2586
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,760
daniel in the point oh and i i brought

2587
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,840
up so i i talked to people who

2588
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,159
who very much are in an activist camp

2589
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,239
and you know they want it they want to

2590
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,199
see that

2591
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,880
realistic and then there's the

2592
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,800
statistical camp and they really want to

2593
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,520
have that

2594
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,920
sort of top down where's the channel

2595
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,880
what's going on

2596
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,120
and i i just kind of thought what your

2597
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,080
paper did is it

2598
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,920
it opened both of those perspectives

2599
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,280
i don't know that they even have to

2600
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,080
necessarily merge or overlap i think

2601
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,120
the fact that we can we can

2602
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,520
use both and see both it's just a really

2603
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,560
interesting thing now

2604
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,120
i don't know whether that is disprovable

2605
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,480
or it should be

2606
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,480
uh i guess that would mean that an

2607
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,920
activism is not a thing or

2608
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,679
statistical modeling is not a thing and

2609
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,760
yet we use these things so i

2610
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,840
i mean i guess they can be discounted

2611
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,880
but i don't know that they'll go away

2612
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,520
that's all i so i guess you have

2613
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,520
answered my question we can leave things

2614
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,320
open

2615
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,440
and up and not necessarily have them

2616
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,719
provide everything but but we can't

2617
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,199
just sort of discount something and

2618
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,159
throw it away

2619
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,880
until somebody as you said comes along

2620
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,800
and says no right

2621
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,679
it doesn't work yeah and just one quick

2622
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,880
follow-up on this this

2623
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,560
the one reason i wrote this paper is

2624
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,920
that i think

2625
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,280
what a lot of people find compelling

2626
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,880
about the free energy principle and the

2627
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,159
literature around that is

2628
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,600
the idea that there might be a link

2629
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,920
between physics and

2630
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,120
cognition right that there is a

2631
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,960
fundamental theory kind of emerging

2632
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,760
but it's i think it's very hard to pin

2633
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,000
down what the precise relationship

2634
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,679
it's hard for different people at

2635
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,120
different times it's becoming

2636
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,800
it's becoming clearer this has been

2637
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,000
worked out a little bit in the free

2638
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,199
energy principle literature

2639
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,000
but like it's it's difficult to

2640
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,960
articulate exactly what the

2641
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,239
the deep connection is between

2642
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,920
you know variational inference on the

2643
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,400
one hand and and like

2644
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,440
um the behavior of physical systems so

2645
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,719
i just wanted to i you know i wanted to

2646
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:19,600
throw out

2647
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,080
here's one um version one possibility of

2648
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,639
what

2649
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,520
the uh supposed to be a clean precise

2650
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,719
brief statement of what that

2651
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:27,360
relationship

2652
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,480
could be um so that you know it

2653
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,840
yeah it's open-ended but so that it can

2654
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,000
be you know false falsified juxtaposed

2655
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,040
to other

2656
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,719
um other interpretations of that

2657
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,719
relation etc

2658
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,440
thanks alex we'll go to blue and then if

2659
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,320
anyone in the chat

2660
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,639
or if dave has a comment then feel free

2661
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,280
but first blue

2662
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,280
so alex i think that this goes back to

2663
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,880
what you were saying in the very

2664
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,840
beginning about scale right so it's it's

2665
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,679
it's hard right now even to map like

2666
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,480
cognition onto like neural activation i

2667
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,560
mean i mean right now we don't know

2668
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,120
um too much like too many components in

2669
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,760
the system

2670
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,679
are are murky for it to really be

2671
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,760
clear what's happening and i think you

2672
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,360
know as we talk about

2673
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,440
information going from a cell you know

2674
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,600
to from a brain to a neuron to cognition

2675
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,480
to action

2676
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,320
to bodily regulation and these kinds of

2677
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,480
things we don't really know

2678
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,400
is information compressed is it

2679
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,679
integrated like

2680
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,800
what is happening to scale a system

2681
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,679
up or down right i think that that's a

2682
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:30,159
hard

2683
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,679
problem yeah i mean maybe i'm not sure

2684
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,040
what you mean by scaling the system

2685
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,800
up or down um

2686
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
in in this section you talk about the

2687
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,320
scale-free nature

2688
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,480
of free energy dynamics and about how

2689
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,080
global and local free energy

2690
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,199
minimization

2691
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:50,159
could be understood as subsystems that

2692
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:50,960
are

2693
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,840
undergoing some sort of uh akin process

2694
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,600
at their own skills

2695
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,040
right um

2696
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,719
yeah so i mean the the thing that

2697
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,080
so i mean the thing that i wanted to

2698
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,080
react to and what blue said was

2699
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,199
um the idea that we don't really know

2700
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,000
what's going on

2701
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,360
in the brain still it's very murky i

2702
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,800
mean i think that's true it's always

2703
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
relative right to some

2704
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,360
ideal of how much we could know but i

2705
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,000
mean

2706
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,199
what got me into this whole literature

2707
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,199
in the first place was was i was

2708
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,760
i started i starting again starting with

2709
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,480
the machine learning

2710
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,679
literature around 2012 2013 i started to

2711
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:28,880
feel like we actually were getting a

2712
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,679
grasp on

2713
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,360
on some of these principles how this

2714
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,280
works quite generally so like

2715
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,960
like the helmholtz machine for example

2716
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,880
um that blue you talked about that in

2717
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,159
the point zero

2718
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,960
um i think that's a model now if the

2719
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,000
model is accurate

2720
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,320
then it seems like what's happening is

2721
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,360
as we

2722
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,239
um you know as signals are sent from one

2723
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,920
neuronal population to another

2724
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,080
um further from the sensory motor

2725
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,040
periphery

2726
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,040
um the information is being compressed

2727
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,719
right so that's a particular hypothesis

2728
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:57,199
that

2729
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,760
there's a successive compression of

2730
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,320
information

2731
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,080
meaning that things are represented

2732
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,280
using uh you know lower dimensional

2733
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,480
um well vector spaces if you want to

2734
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,920
translate between vector spaces and

2735
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,760
neuronal populations right

2736
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,360
um and and that we have a pretty good

2737
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:17,760
idea

2738
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,760
right like this this sort of

2739
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,040
architecture explains

2740
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,040
so many things i mean that's this is

2741
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,440
this is what got people so excited about

2742
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,320
the you know

2743
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,159
predictive brain or the bayesian brain

2744
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,600
type hypotheses is that

2745
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,199
there's so many different things from

2746
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,560
different domains in psychology and

2747
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,080
neuroscience that this seems to

2748
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,320
this kind of perspective seems to unify

2749
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,520
um

2750
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,360
you know it's it's it's it's to be

2751
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,199
expected in a sort of helmholtzian

2752
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:42,880
architecture that like

2753
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,440
you know uh the you can always sort of

2754
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,239
endogenous

2755
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,159
endogenously cause the same sorts of

2756
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:49,679
states that you could be in

2757
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,679
as a result of perception right and that

2758
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:52,960
imagination

2759
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,360
and internal generation of states has a

2760
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,960
particular role to play in learning

2761
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,239
and things like this so i'm kind of

2762
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,239
rambling but um

2763
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,679
my my sense is that this um

2764
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,000
this sort of bayesian helmholtzian

2765
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,280
revolution or whatever you want to call

2766
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:07,760
it

2767
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,560
in recent years has has shown that we we

2768
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,600
do understand

2769
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,040
many principles of how the brain

2770
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,480
functions at the level of like at the

2771
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,600
human scale

2772
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,760
um if the question is about like how to

2773
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,679
how how do other scales fold into this

2774
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,600
i um i mean there's some work that

2775
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,440
maxwell ramstead and casper has been

2776
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,040
people like that have done

2777
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,760
on on understanding their on all

2778
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,440
population dynamics in terms of active

2779
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,639
inference at that scale

2780
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,080
and so that's really interesting um

2781
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,920
uh so like what i would think of as a

2782
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,520
structural like a structural

2783
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,040
representation from the point of view of

2784
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,440
me or you like a human being

2785
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,080
um you can also think of as a process of

2786
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,239
neurons performing active inference

2787
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,239
right at their own scale um but i think

2788
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,920
there's to me the hard question there is

2789
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,520
how do you relate

2790
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,920
uh the contents of the representation at

2791
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,440
the higher scale to the contents of the

2792
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,560
lower scale

2793
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,760
that that's that's the thing that

2794
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,719
bothers me about in this area

2795
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,800
yeah just if i could just respond really

2796
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,000
quick yeah that's exactly

2797
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,719
the the thing i mean we can see how this

2798
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,480
active inference is happening

2799
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,360
at different scales for sure but how

2800
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,199
scaling up and scaling down or

2801
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,360
or the the translation from one scale to

2802
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,040
another happens is very

2803
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,639
like mysterious still yeah totally

2804
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,400
cool so we have about 20 minutes left so

2805
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,840
if anyone has a question in the live

2806
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,480
chat

2807
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,960
otherwise we'll go to scott and then

2808
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,199
stephen and be preparing our thoughts

2809
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,719
for what to continue discussing in point

2810
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:35,199
two

2811
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:38,960
so scott so um picking up in the last

2812
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,679
couple of points

2813
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:41,600
really interesting the i was thinking of

2814
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,199
what was the gentleman's name who

2815
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,199
barrettson who said information is the

2816
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,480
difference that makes a difference what

2817
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,199
was that guy's name is it

2818
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,960
anyway the difference that makes a

2819
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,239
difference and i always thought

2820
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,080
the first difference that he's talking

2821
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,679
about is the

2822
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,960
very um perceptual a perceptual change

2823
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,560
in the environment and the second

2824
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,360
difference is

2825
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,119
is that perceptual change relevant to

2826
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,360
you and so i want to unpack that a

2827
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,719
little bit here because

2828
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,719
contents one of the things that i was

2829
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,000
talking about my mit

2830
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,520
presentation and one of the things i

2831
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,520
noted is shannon tells us

2832
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,560
signal versus noise but it it

2833
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,880
i think but it doesn't tell us if the

2834
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,840
signal is

2835
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,719
a cancer cure or a chocolate chip cookie

2836
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,239
recipe

2837
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,880
right and so the content is left

2838
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,000
undefined

2839
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,360
there now what if so

2840
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,239
so i define living systems as auto

2841
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:35,119
catalytic

2842
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:38,480
entropy secreting structures

2843
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,679
notice i don't say they have to be

2844
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,000
embodied in any particular embodiment my

2845
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,600
son said the only reason i came up with

2846
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,800
the definition is i wanted to use the

2847
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,760
word secretion

2848
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,280
because it was juicy but he's right in

2849
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:49,760
part

2850
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,480
i wanted to make it juicy but the reason

2851
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,159
i raised that here

2852
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:56,880
is when you look at barrett-center or

2853
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,800
whoever was it barons in any way the

2854
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,800
difference that makes a difference

2855
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,239
um info information really maybe

2856
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,520
is what we cognitive beings call

2857
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,280
relevant differentials that we perceive

2858
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,400
irrelevant differentials are just noise

2859
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,760
and so the difference that makes a

2860
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,520
difference we call it information but

2861
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,040
there's a lot of differentials out there

2862
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,239
in the world

2863
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,320
and that's the reason i'm going there is

2864
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,920
since we're talking to a philosopher

2865
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,199
today

2866
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,040
and what i deal with as a lawyer is

2867
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,400
rhetoric

2868
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,320
and rhetoric is what you do to bring

2869
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,040
together incommensurables

2870
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,520
right and rhetoric is not like crazy

2871
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,320
glue it's like

2872
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,040
it's like um epoxy it doesn't just bring

2873
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,560
things together it also brings them

2874
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,199
together and fills gaps

2875
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,719
so the rhetoric of information

2876
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,760
is our storytelling about

2877
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,760
relevant differentials and we seek to

2878
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,560
sculpt our internal model and then train

2879
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,040
other people's internal models

2880
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,800
because when we entrain other people's

2881
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,280
internal models with our rhetoric

2882
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,400
then it de-risks our externality because

2883
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,480
other people's internal models are my

2884
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,080
externality right so the rhetoric

2885
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,280
is the tool that we use to reduce

2886
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,840
differentials or to increase relevance

2887
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,159
alignment among cognitive systems

2888
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,440
running cognition how's that i wanted to

2889
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,480
try to integrate

2890
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,639
it that seemed to me that last couple of

2891
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:29,600
comments

2892
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,920
it felt like it may be information is an

2893
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,119
article when we put

2894
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,679
much in seeking information maybe

2895
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,280
information the difference that makes a

2896
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,320
difference

2897
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,080
after the fact we can tell that because

2898
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,920
before the fact we can't tell

2899
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,280
what's relevant for instance suntan

2900
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,119
lotion never existed because we didn't

2901
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,000
know that photons caused skin cancer

2902
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
now there's an entire commercial

2903
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,239
factories and areas in the grocery store

2904
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,239
that sell suntan lotion

2905
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,480
now it doesn't mean that the sun became

2906
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,520
carcinogenic

2907
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,719
we just learned that it did so the

2908
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,800
inference we were able to make that

2909
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,639
inference at large scales

2910
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,880
and now influence buying behavior which

2911
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,040
leverages and de-risks future behaviors

2912
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,400
which is the

2913
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,159
reason that we care about information

2914
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,520
that's the difference that makes a

2915
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,400
difference anyways

2916
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,600
a couple of thoughts on this last couple

2917
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,679
of things that's that's really

2918
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,400
cool stuff i mean i i really see things

2919
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,000
similarly i think on a lot of fronts

2920
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,400
there

2921
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,639
um i think uh

2922
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:32,000
uh so the question of it sounded

2923
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,600
to me like you're kind of saying like we

2924
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,679
don't have to be too

2925
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,679
fixated on this term information because

2926
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,760
it really it means

2927
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,760
differences that make a difference or

2928
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,199
being aware of differentials

2929
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:47,119
so i mean i i

2930
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,520
agree with that i think um i mean i i

2931
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,600
again i always go back to just the

2932
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,320
the sort of bedrock stuff so like i

2933
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:54,639
think

2934
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,000
i think shannon's interpretation of

2935
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,280
information was actually a little bit

2936
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,880
unnecessarily epistemic

2937
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,960
i think it could have been just doxastic

2938
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,159
so he says you know

2939
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,400
it's coming to know something it's like

2940
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,440
well

2941
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,719
but we could generalize that and just

2942
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,480
talk about what one comes to believe

2943
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,840
and then i think if we have if we work

2944
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,360
with that notion which isn't information

2945
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,239
anymore

2946
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,239
as shannon defined it because he talked

2947
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,920
about knowledge but whatever that

2948
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,760
generalization of information is called

2949
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,960
um i think that would really um conduct

2950
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,080
the logic thanks um yeah so um

2951
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,520
so that's that's all that i think we're

2952
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,040
getting at with the concept of

2953
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,480
information but what what i think it's

2954
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,600
really interesting and difficult

2955
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,679
philosophically is

2956
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:36,239
okay so obviously there's there's self

2957
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,320
information right so there's just like

2958
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,960
something pings my retina and or you

2959
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,800
know

2960
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,080
something downstream from that and i

2961
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,560
notice a little flip in my visual field

2962
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:46,960
right

2963
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,639
and that's that's something i'm aware of

2964
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,320
so that's information about itself

2965
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:50,960
anyway

2966
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,639
but then the you know the more important

2967
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,320
signals carry all sorts of information

2968
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,840
about other things

2969
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,199
meaning they i guess they lead us to

2970
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,280
predict and expect other differences

2971
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,520
beyond themselves and so and so the

2972
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,760
tricky thing to me is okay so

2973
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,560
i take myself to be this system of

2974
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,000
interacting parts

2975
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,320
neurons and also other things obviously

2976
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,600
that um

2977
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,639
sort of embodies a perspective and the

2978
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,239
information that a signal carries

2979
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,600
depends on

2980
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,000
that whole system and how this signal

2981
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,719
impacts

2982
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,520
it right and and you know one of my

2983
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,400
neurons is a

2984
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,360
entirely different type of system here's

2985
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,080
my daughter

2986
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,320
tell me something what's up you got ice

2987
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,840
cream awesome

2988
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:37,840
sorry um

2989
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,239
that's awesome um yeah so

2990
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,920
your generative model's on a live stream

2991
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,480
right now i'm sorry

2992
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,320
that's cool yeah um i don't know so i

2993
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,440
was saying something about neurons and

2994
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,960
then now i'm thinking about ice cream

2995
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,639
um basically yeah so so the

2996
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,520
tr like that the question for me is so

2997
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,520
like i think of content right the

2998
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,440
information content of a signal for a

2999
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,199
person as relative to

3000
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,679
the person to the system and so if

3001
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:10,800
you've got a completely different system

3002
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,080
with a different structure

3003
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,360
i think you can sort of compare the

3004
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,520
structures of the systems to see how

3005
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,080
similar the content is right but i think

3006
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,000
it has to be at that whole level

3007
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,080
of the sort of holistic entire system

3008
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,199
level that you need to make these

3009
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:24,960
content comparisons

3010
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,000
um so i don't remember whether that

3011
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,760
directly links back to where we started

3012
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,119
this but

3013
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,560
um nice

3014
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,639
in one one quick thought on that is the

3015
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,320
the difference that makes a difference

3016
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
which is also a big key term in the

3017
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,920
philosophy of biology

3018
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,520
like the mutation is the difference that

3019
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,360
makes a difference for something

3020
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,119
um in active inference it's the

3021
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,560
difference in

3022
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,639
observation that makes a difference for

3023
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,320
either the generative model updating

3024
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,280
that's inference

3025
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,320
or the difference that makes a

3026
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,639
difference for action so we have a way

3027
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:57,760
to talk about it and then

3028
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,679
also um the doxastic note

3029
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:04,639
not my total area but it looks like this

3030
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,880
is how we can work towards pluralism

3031
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,800
across perspectives because if it's

3032
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,960
framed as one person believes that it's

3033
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,320
hot and one person believes that it's

3034
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,119
cold

3035
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,560
if there's only one truth and we're

3036
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,560
gonna play tug of war then

3037
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,719
we have to fight but if it's true that

3038
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,239
one person believes it's hot and it's

3039
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,560
true that one person believes it's cold

3040
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,400
there's no problem there still might be

3041
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,679
differences on what temperature the

3042
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,119
people want the room

3043
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,760
but by framing things about what a

3044
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,840
perspective or a system or an agent

3045
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
believes to be true or just believes

3046
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,080
period could be an ironic belief

3047
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,800
all of a sudden we can interact with

3048
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,719
multi-agent systems

3049
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,880
and deal with them in a way that still

3050
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,560
has local logic

3051
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,960
so steven and then anyone else

3052
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,040
so thanks just so closing out i suppose

3053
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,719
in a way

3054
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,600
i'd be curious how this this work with

3055
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,560
beliefs that

3056
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,159
has a nice as as daniel said it bridges

3057
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,960
action orientated approaches and

3058
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,040
pragmatic approaches with more

3059
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,800
epistemic approaches because beliefs

3060
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,320
tend to be beliefs about

3061
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,880
what will happen when something is done

3062
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:15,679
in the world

3063
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:19,199
often not necessarily and i'm curious

3064
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:22,840
how this paper and this kind of

3065
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,480
underpinning relates or helped to

3066
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,280
inform where you were going with a new

3067
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,520
paper that was intriguing about the

3068
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,719
folk psychology and how maybe that that

3069
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,560
there's some sort of that's where one of

3070
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,000
the bridges out

3071
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,119
from this paper into

3072
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,760
you know folk psychology being how we

3073
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,719
kind of intuitively believe the world is

3074
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,040
based on our experiences so there is a

3075
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,320
certain element of like

3076
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,520
whether that's how it's structured in

3077
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,360
the brain it's kind of how

3078
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,440
we might structure it before science

3079
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,199
tells us something else

3080
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,600
in a in a certain socio-cultural sense

3081
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,440
so i'd be interested in

3082
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,280
how that extension plays out with this

3083
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,800
paper

3084
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,800
yeah so so there's definitely a direct

3085
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,400
connection between this paper and

3086
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,880
and that one i mean i wanted to write a

3087
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,239
sort of sequel to this paper where i

3088
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,360
talked about

3089
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,840
specifically desires and how those the

3090
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,600
the sort of

3091
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,199
the way those would be grounded in

3092
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,880
thermodynamics according to this picture

3093
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,960
or co-native states in general like the

3094
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,719
states with a world to mind direction of

3095
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,400
fit um

3096
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,560
and so then i started talking to to ryan

3097
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,480
smith and others about this and we ended

3098
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,040
up

3099
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,280
you know co-authoring a quite different

3100
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,320
paper that

3101
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,480
has some commonality but i still want to

3102
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,600
write um

3103
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,040
i still want to write one that's more on

3104
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,360
the thermodynamic side of things but

3105
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,280
um the connection is in this you know

3106
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,040
the sort of identity thesis

3107
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,000
that at the end of this paper i argue

3108
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,239
for it by way of david lewis who

3109
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,719
who one of the terms in the identity is

3110
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,719
the implicit definition

3111
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,280
that folk psychology gives us of mental

3112
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,560
states

3113
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,920
um so we haven't really gotten into that

3114
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,679
maybe we will next week or something i

3115
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,760
don't know there's ramsay sentences

3116
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,080
i'd love to talk about them we got we

3117
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,000
got the ramsey sentences

3118
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,280
we got the sleep wake simulation yeah

3119
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,600
other topics that we will really look

3120
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,040
forward to exploring

3121
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,679
yeah let's please get into that but um

3122
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,920
like

3123
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,400
basically i mean i don't know if as

3124
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,119
usual

3125
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,560
i feel i always feel like i'm not doing

3126
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,000
an adequate job of answering questions

3127
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,960
i'm sorry

3128
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,760
but um but by folk psychology in this

3129
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,360
context i'm really thinking of just

3130
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,199
our our it's sort of like theory of mind

3131
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,560
right it's like our

3132
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,880
implicit theory of the way people

3133
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,000
including ourselves

3134
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,639
um function so i think that

3135
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,159
that's essential even though it's not

3136
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,600
highly until the end that's essential to

3137
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,800
what i'm doing in this paper because if

3138
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,480
you don't have

3139
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,040
mental states to define then you don't

3140
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,239
have any identity

3141
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,520
relation because that's one of the terms

3142
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,280
in the identity relation although you

3143
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,119
could also i guess

3144
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,840
maybe if you're doing pure bayesian

3145
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,040
modeling you could just write down a

3146
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,639
bunch of states and

3147
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,440
equations for how they update um without

3148
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,119
thinking about spoke psychology at all

3149
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,560
but but i guess the point of this is

3150
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,280
that

3151
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,080
um if one of the terms in this relation

3152
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,119
is the mind

3153
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,280
well i think folk psychology i don't

3154
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,800
actually love that term i mean

3155
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,800
it's okay it's a philosopher's term of

3156
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,520
art right i just mean

3157
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,159
intuitive human psychology i think is

3158
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,880
one of the terms in this relation

3159
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,000
cool scientists are folk too so

3160
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
cognitive diversity means that we have

3161
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,159
all different ways of knowing and there

3162
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:37,199
may not be one

3163
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,920
default or simply intuitive way of

3164
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,199
working or knowing because what's

3165
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,639
intuitive to one person

3166
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,719
will be out of the groove for somebody

3167
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,560
else and that's why the

3168
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,960
movement towards pluralism in terms of

3169
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,080
our understanding of

3170
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,880
ideas and of ecosystems is so

3171
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,639
interesting to talk about and see

3172
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:57,119
connected to active inference

3173
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,199
any um thoughts or what would be

3174
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:01,199
something that somebody's excited

3175
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,679
from the conversation today or thinking

3176
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,280
about how we could resolve

3177
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,880
or at least introduce again next week

3178
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,400
i think a few of the things we have

3179
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,080
written down is the sleep wake

3180
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,320
simulation what is that agent doing what

3181
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,080
does it do in terms of your model

3182
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,280
we have the ramsay sentences and where

3183
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,320
does that

3184
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,400
style of logical representation come

3185
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,080
into play we have

3186
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,639
empirical validity what kind of

3187
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:27,520
experiments

3188
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,440
are you interested in or curious about

3189
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,960
what what else could be interesting

3190
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,800
uh we could still talk about the the

3191
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,719
contrast of divergence versus simulated

3192
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,239
annealing thing

3193
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:43,520
um i just really briefly wanted to

3194
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,560
follow up and say i

3195
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,600
think when i say intuitive psychology

3196
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,880
i mean i don't mean to suggest that

3197
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,040
there's just one of those i think that

3198
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,480
but i do think we can sort of average

3199
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,320
over different perspectives to get

3200
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,280
that so like uh the individual

3201
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,119
perspectives ultimately are what's real

3202
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,360
but if we want to talk about things at

3203
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,040
an abstract level we could average over

3204
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,080
those and i think that's kind of what

3205
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,600
lewis tries to do so

3206
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,719
maybe this is something we'll get into

3207
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:09,119
next week um but

3208
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,440
really he when he talks about folk

3209
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,239
psychology

3210
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:15,440
he he he engineers it so that it doesn't

3211
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,199
have to be that there's just one set of

3212
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,880
state statements that embodies what

3213
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,280
people think about psychology it's like

3214
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,400
a disjunction of different um sets that

3215
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,159
mostly overlap

3216
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,679
um um and just yeah i mean

3217
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:33,119
pluralism is really i think is um

3218
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:35,600
is a good idea in many contexts um i

3219
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,480
actually think

3220
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,760
this would be interesting this might be

3221
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,159
controversial i think it's not always

3222
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:42,159
the goal in science because if you start

3223
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,840
out with pluralism

3224
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,239
then you just don't do anything right

3225
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:46,960
it's like okay

3226
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,639
everything's fine as it is but i think

3227
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,960
sometimes we're seeking a unifying

3228
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,119
underlying explanation and if you accept

3229
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:54,639
pluralism at the start then you won't

3230
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:55,920
get there

3231
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,800
that tension which is okay pluralism

3232
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,639
everybody must be pluralist and this is

3233
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:01,840
the only way

3234
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,159
it's actually absolutist and singular at

3235
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,280
a higher level

3236
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,679
and so pluralism means that we each do

3237
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:09,840
have our perspectives and yet there is a

3238
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,719
way of working

3239
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:12,400
it's not just the same thing as saying

3240
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,000
we have an absolute answer

3241
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,040
and it's that there's no answer that's

3242
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,599
the kind of local logical paradoxes that

3243
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:21,840
we see all around us

3244
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,239
that's a great point stephen and then

3245
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:25,760
anyone else

3246
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,400
yes that's that's the um the rabbit hole

3247
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,080
of post-modernism

3248
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,000
oh we don't want to go but it's it's

3249
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,119
it's good

3250
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,960
this is a really rich conversation and

3251
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,280
uh i think like you say it's uh

3252
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,560
to be able to jump from helmholtz to

3253
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,560
some of these trans-cultural things is

3254
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,880
uh you know it shows you that it's

3255
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,400
pretty foundational some of the stuff

3256
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,920
we're touching so that's great

3257
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,639
so thanks for a lovely a lovely talk

3258
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,320
today i really enjoyed it thank you

3259
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,040
yeah thanks a lot any closing notes

3260
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,800
there alex otherwise we're all gonna

3261
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,440
probably

3262
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,760
re-listen and re-read and think about

3263
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,400
what would be good to ask next week

3264
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,080
yeah i know thank thank you all it's

3265
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,760
it's really fascinating and

3266
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,840
fun and i just want to do more of it

3267
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,679
next week i'm

3268
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,679
i'm very uh i'm

3269
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,119
i didn't have anything else to say but i

3270
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,679
kept speaking i'm not sure why

3271
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,719
same way do that do that sometimes it

3272
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:21,760
happens

3273
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,440
so thanks again everybody who's

3274
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,760
participating live and on live stream

3275
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:31,599
and we will see you next week
