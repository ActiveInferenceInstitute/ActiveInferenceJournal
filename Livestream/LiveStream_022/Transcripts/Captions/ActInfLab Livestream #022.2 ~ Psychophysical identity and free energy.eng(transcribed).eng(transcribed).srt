00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
nice repeating digits there we're here

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080

to be having our second

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
follow-up discussion on the paper we've

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,199
been discussing for the little

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,080
last bit psychophysical identity and

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,279
free energy

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,200
it's may 25th 2021 and this will be

12

learning and practicing

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
applied active inference you can find us

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
at the links that are listed here

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,760
stream so

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
discussions in late may 21

and happy to have alex joining us for

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
both of these discussions which has been

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
great today in 22.2

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
quick correction we will be just trying

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
to learn and discuss

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,759
enjoying these conversations seeing

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
where they go enjoying what questions

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
bring up and also

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
carrying on with a few of the topics

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
that we knew that we wanted to cover

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
from last week and with that

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
being said we can jump right in so we

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,680
can go to

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
the introductions and we'll just um

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
maybe go around introduce ourselves say

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,840
hello

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
and then end with alex and alex would be

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
happy to hear your thoughts or

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040

i think you're the only alex right now

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
okay okay i wasn't sure there's a fellow

72

jester

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
i watch it um oh so i'm alex kiefer

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
um thanks for having me back again to

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
talk about this paper

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
um i'm a philosopher i'm

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,959
currently affiliated with monash

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,120
university and i'm also doing more

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
applied work

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
for nested minds solutions uh it's a

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
kind of active inference ai startup

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
cool um there's a few ways we can

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
start but why don't you feel free to

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
give any opening yes and then we can

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,799
ask questions we have some other slots

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
right so you asked about my reflections

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
over the past week um

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
i haven't reflected a whole lot on deep

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
themes um i

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
did uh go through so

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,680
in the point zero discussion there was a

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
um

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,879
sort of a question about how we get from

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
two point one equation two two one to

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,080
two two

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,879
um with the flipping of the uh p's and

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,599
q's

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,480
so that strikes me as like not the most

99
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,599
central theme we could

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,080
spend time on but i did uh just spend

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
some time writing out the derivation

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,200
if that's something we can get to at

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
some point um

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
but in general like i guess my feeling

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,319
is i think

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
last week was really fun and we kind of

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,840
it was very far-ranging

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
um i i think it would be fun to like

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,839
to drill down a bit more on some of the

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
specifics this week but

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,880
you know it's kind of also whatever

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,759
people want to say so

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
that's that's what i'd be interested in

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
doing thank you alex welcome

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
blue if you'd like to just say hi we're

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
having intros and then we'll sort of

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,680
walk through some

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
jokes and questions good morning i'm

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
blue knight i'm an independent research

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,479
consultant based out of new mexico

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
cool so there's a bunch of places that

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
we wrote down

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,000
to jump in um maybe actually we could go

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,639
to dean's three functions walk into a

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,360
bar

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
so it's slide 11 and i'll have it up

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,040
large on the stream

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
so dean why don't you unpack what you

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
were thinking here and

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
let's get some initial reads to get the

131
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
contrastive ball rolling

132
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
well essentially what the the point two

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
aspect of this

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,380
process does is it takes um

135
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,800
[Music]

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
basically what we've introduced as as

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
as the topic uh tried to gain some

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
interpretation around it and then

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,199
so what does that mean what does that

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
turn into and so

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
um one of the products of that

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,000
for me was uh i kind of went back and

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,759
reviewed the um

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,800
the 22.1 and one of the things about

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
what you mentioned alex was the

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
explication of a simple idea

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
and i thought that was really important

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,340
and so

149
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,520
[Music]

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
what can that what can that turn into

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
that simple idea

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
that was the the three functions walk

153
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
into a bar piece

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
and essentially spoke to what scott was

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,919
talking about last time in terms of

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
paradoxes and what do those mean and

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
when do we model and when do we follow

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,560
but i thought the bottom part was

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,319
was an important piece in terms of you

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,600
mentioning

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
uh that you saw continuities

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
and i wondered if you were referring to

163
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
cynicism

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
and that idea of how

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,400
we take discontinuities and turn them

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
into continuities

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
man that's that's really interesting so

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
i had never heard of cynicism

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,919
i keep coming to pier paris through like

170
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
strange avenues that were not planned

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
um i never consciously thought of it

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
this way but this kind of nicely

173
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
summarizes like how i see things

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and and the the way i've just been sort

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
of forced by experience to approach

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
philosophy

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
it like like like i i found it

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
difficult or impossible to draw to draw

179
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
boundaries that would create

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
discontinuities

181
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,240
between categories quite generally so

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
you know that gets into things like the

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
sororities paradox there's plenty of

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
examples of this but

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,759
i think it's it for me it's much harder

186
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
to find a discontinuity than to

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,560
uh yeah than the opposite okay

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
can you maybe just walk us through these

189
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
three functions

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
walking into a bar what what is the

191
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,800
narrative here

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
and where does it sit in relation to the

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,759
paper

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,800
you're asking me yeah yeah okay so so

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,759
essentially

196
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
if we're if we're gonna if we're gonna

197
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
talk about contrastive divergence which

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
i think is

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
a critical path to understanding how

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,880
we move down a gradient

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,120
and arrive at some sort of um

202
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
generative model i think that there are

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,199
three functions that

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,440
essentially exist in that it's an

205
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,639
inversion

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
process which i again i'm not going to

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
go into the

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
the the the reads on that there's an

209
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,560
identity piece which

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
is spoken to explicitly in in alex's

211
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,919
paper

212
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
and then there's the contrastive diverse

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,400
contrast of divergence piece

214
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,919
which enables a person to remain

215
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
balanced despite the fact that they

216
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
don't have a particular answer that

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
there are hidden states

218
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
and i think what a lot of what was

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
being spoken to last time uh scott

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
mentioned some things blue

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,280
uh stephen was things like scale

222
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
which don't necessarily we don't come at

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,800
it with

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
with the same perception as to what

225
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
we're looking at

226
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
some of us look at things a little bit

227
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
on a grander model and some of us look

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
at an on a granular

229
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,880
model and i think that the part

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
of being able to fit that into a a form

231
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
like the joke the three three guys walk

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
into a bar or whatever

233
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,920
kind of speaks to the fact that um

234
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
if you think that this is going to be

235
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,320
about stability

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
you're going to get interrupted by the

237
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
change aspect of it if you think it's

238
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
going to be all about the change piece

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
you're not going to be able to realize

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,839
any sort of conceptualizations because

241
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,399
conceptualizations require stability

242
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,880
so you have to kind of be able to play

243
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
in both

244
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
fields at the same time and that's hard

245
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
and i think that's why

246
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,320
alex's paper probably knocked me down

247
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
about five times when i first read it

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,040
because

249
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
you actually did alex try to somehow

250
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
pull together

251
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
the ideal idea of stabilizing something

252
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
even though things were

253
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
pretty choppy and and rather dynamic

254
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
so i don't know if this is an example of

255
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
where the part two

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
of us discussing your paper goes but i

257
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
think it's

258
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
it's interesting especially in the

259
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
context of cynicism and your

260
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
idea that we're constantly trying to

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
move from the unknown

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
to the known as opposed to the

263
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
traditional this is what i know

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,560
and i'm moving into these unknown spaces

265
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
that reminds me of then anyone alex or

266
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
anyone else

267
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
reminds me of sort of two complimentary

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
ways of thinking about education

269
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
with the tabula rasa the blank slate

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,079
that inscription is put into

271
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
it's like filling the cup with knowledge

272
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
or inscribing into something that's

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
templateless and then the alternative is

274
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
to burn away

275
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
ignorance and so it's almost like a moot

276
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
whether we're moving from the known

277
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
into the unknown or the unknown towards

278
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,959
the known

279
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
they're they're are left in our right

280
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,519
hands of education

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
right yeah yeah this is really cool i

282
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:38,959
mean it

283
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
it seems like um uh

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
dean like you have you have an act for

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
like reading

286
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,480
reading things in a sort of very uh

287
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
deeper almost allegorical way we're like

288
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
i'm talking about it

289
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,240
yeah yeah i read charles saunders pierce

290
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
two decades ago

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
before it became popular right so

292
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,959
yeah so so i think it's interesting and

293
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
it's it's all um

294
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,399
these connections are really there but

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
um i just just to to comment on this for

296
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,600
a second um so

297
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,279
so so i do think that there's something

298
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
about just the

299
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
how ubiquitous sort of dynamism is

300
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
and all this and how there's in a sense

301
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,959
there's no stable process that we can

302
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,160
latch onto here but

303
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
when i was talking about contrast of

304
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
divergence my main point was just

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
um well look that's i'm thinking of that

306
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
very narrowly as a machine learning

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
like an unsupervised learning algorithm

308
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,519
right which i i know you have that in

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,959
mind too but you're also taking a

310
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,440
broader

311
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
picture um so

312
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
um my point in contrasting contrastive

313
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
diversions to

314
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
uh simulated annealing was uh

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,279
we can suppose that the brain is running

316
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,720
something like contrastive divergence

317
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
where it's trying to it's trying to

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
reach a lower energy

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
state um but you know

320
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,399
the way that algorithm works of course

321
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,839
you don't need to

322
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,360
actually run right the basic idea

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
um is that you don't need to

324
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
so so okay sorry let me take a step back

325
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,720
for a second

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,240
um right so like one way of doing

327
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
this sort of unsupervised learning would

328
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
be to to take the distribution over

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
hidden states in a neural net that's

330
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,839
induced by an input

331
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,399
and uh try to

332
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,720
uh lower the energy of those states

333
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,839
while raising the energy of the

334
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,600
fantasies that the network would produce

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,639
top down right um and so

336
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
the ideal way to do that would be to run

337
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,839
run the network until it reaches its

338
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,720
equilibrium

339
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
distribution and sample from that when

340
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,839
you're doing the negative

341
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
the negative phase of this of um

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,519
increasing the energy of the or the

343
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,040
therefore lowering the probability of

344
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,519
the

345
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
fantasies um contrasted divergence just

346
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
takes a shortcut and just runs this for

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
like one step or two steps or whatever

348
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
um so i just want to make that clear it

349
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,600
i don't know if it's clear for everyone

350
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
in the audience who hasn't looked at

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,120
this

352
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,240
deeply um that that's

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
the the specific contrast that i wanted

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
to draw there was just

355
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
was just between that and a process like

356
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
simulated annealing where if you

357
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
if you run it to the to the end of the

358
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
process you end up reaching the lowest

359
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
possible energy state

360
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,160
um so the brain i guess my point is the

361
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
brain doesn't necessarily need to be

362
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,480
settling to

363
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
and this does i think connect directly

364
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,360
to your point it doesn't need to be

365
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
settling

366
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
to a completely you know stable state or

367
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,760
even

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,279
um uh any particular like metastable

369
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,000
state it just has

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,560
to be there has to be this gradient

371
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,680
right

372
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
that is available um but i do think that

373
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,560
there's a deeper point here

374
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,399
right so the nests or the

375
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
non-equilibrium steady state that

376
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,680
um organisms are are

377
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
approaching uh as they as they do this

378
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,079
variational inference

379
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
thing is not any kind of final

380
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
um you know it's it's not it's not a

381
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,399
static

382
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
state like some kind of uh

383
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,399
ultimate equilibrium right well going

384
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,920
down a set of stairs

385
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
the one the one steady thing is that i

386
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
remain balanced and not go tumbling to

387
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
my

388
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
eyes right that's the one steady thing

389
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
the one balance thing

390
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,920
and then there's the gradient itself

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
that's why the there's a next slide that

392
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
kind of speaks to the

393
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,839
that piece of it and i that's all that's

394
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
all i basically wanted to bring up

395
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
because i think

396
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,199
and i think the cynicism piece embraces

397
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
or

398
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
entails all of that there's a there's a

399
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
dynamic piece

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
and there's a balancing piece and you

401
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
and you want to be able to

402
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
sort of address both that's that's cool

403
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,920
yep thank you dean stephen and then adam

404
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
there's interesting questions here for

405
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,360
pragmatism

406
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
and social constructivism you know in

407
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
terms of how these ideas

408
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
roll out into how we might talk to other

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,199
people in the world

410
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,240
around projects and stuff

411
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,880
because of this implication so i i

412
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
wonder

413
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,880
how you you would bring in

414
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,639
this kind of embodiment of that so

415
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
um if the brain is an organ

416
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,839
that is doing expected more of an

417
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,760
expected free energy with the nervous

418
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,639
system

419
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
to help to manage the movement

420
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
of the organism and the organism overall

421
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
has got that variational free energy to

422
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,639
maintain

423
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,079
homeostasis you you you've got this

424
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480
you've got this energy balance piece but

425
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
you've also got that need for entropy

426
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
so i wonder how with how this can inform

427
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,120
us

428
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,519
just like people when we do i don't know

429
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,639
if you know about the alexander

430
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
technique but it's when someone's

431
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,680
when you think about the body and the

432
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
skeleton we think about it as just the

433
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
bones but actually it's really

434
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
everything's held together in a muscular

435
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,440
sort of

436
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,480
watery yeah and

437
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
and and with the tendons and everything

438
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
so you there needs to be

439
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
some noise in there that that entropy

440
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,920
piece needs to be there when you're

441
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,519
going down the stairs and that

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
you can't be frozen you're full

443
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,519
yet you need to have some of that energy

444
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
equilibrium because again you're full

445
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,079
so there's i wonder how if we were to

446
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
talk to someone out there about their

447
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
life and their world

448
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,160
um walking down the stairs what what

449
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,680
would we translate this

450
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,638
in their language

451
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
alex if you want to give a thought on

452
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
that

453
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
i'm thinking about it um i'm not sure

454
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,160
beyond saying that i do think that

455
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,720
there's a

456
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
balance of two sort of uh

457
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
forces or quantities here always um

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
but i don't this reminds me actually i'm

459
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
not gonna try to put words in your mouth

460
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,759
but this reminds me of

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
uh adam of your your remarks about

462
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,439
free will in relation to degrees of

463
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
freedom and entropy and stuff

464
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
um so

465
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
that's a segue but it doesn't have to be

466
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
taken up

467
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
cool yeah it reminds me of stream of

468
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
consciousness or walking downstairs you

469
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,599
can't just

470
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
stop there statically can't stop

471
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,760
anywhere along the staircase

472
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
and you can't halt the stream of thought

473
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,640
so what is happening that's allowing

474
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,679
time t plus one to be generated from

475
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,000
time

476
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
t the state only has to move by one

477
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
moment at a time it doesn't have to do

478
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
the ultimate um steady state to the

479
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
lowest possible energy

480
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
so adam and then anyone else raising

481
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
their hand

482
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
um i reread your uh paper last night and

483
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
it's even better the second time um i'd

484
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
like to actually talk to you later

485
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
about like getting into the weeds about

486
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
different um

487
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,640
uh like mappings on the neural level of

488
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
like between

489
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
the thermodynamic and the informational

490
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
um but yeah

491
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
before we move on i was wondering how

492
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,799
you'd feel about

493
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
um like a multi-phase

494
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,919
uh or a multi-part description

495
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
um of neural architecture where like

496
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
there's some aspects which might be more

497
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
annealing like

498
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
in some aspects that might be more

499
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
contrastive like

500
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,559
so like you could like for instance tell

501
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,559
a story of like some sort of um

502
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
uh predictive workspace where like you

503
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,799
can think of it as like that the model

504
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,480
selection is like iterative annealing

505
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,919
potentially in terms of some of its

506
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,120
aspects

507
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,160
um but then like it's just like around

508
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
like you you could think of like like

509
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
like the hain style ignition event

510
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
as you're generating this this big high

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
temperature complex

512
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
that then settles down and selects the

513
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
model but this would just be like one of

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,600
the things that's happening like

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
something contrastive could be like

516
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,360
the thalamus like maybe like

517
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,720
orchestrating different

518
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
cycles and comparing them more or like

519
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
the hippocampal system and that could be

520
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
like doing your contrast

521
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
like would that be copacetic or with

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
that right

523
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,840
yeah no that sounds that sounds awesome

524
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
i mean in general it seems

525
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
consistent with like the way i've just

526
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,559
i've learned to see these things you

527
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,160
know just just paying attention to all

528
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
these different sources of evidence it

529
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
seems like

530
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,840
um yeah this kind of

531
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,400
um it's it sounds right to me i guess my

532
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
only

533
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
uncertainty is like the reason i focused

534
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
on um on this contrast was in part

535
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
because

536
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,880
i wanted to argue for as you know for an

537
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
identity between

538
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,600
the the energy free energy in the

539
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
thermodynamic sense and in the

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
variational

541
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
sense relevant to variational inference

542
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
and so

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
uh i needed to i needed to make explicit

544
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
the argument that whatever's going on

545
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,799
even if if there's sort of a

546
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
um multiple time scales in which this is

547
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,600
happening or or if there are different

548
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,840
parts of the system that are

549
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
um in effect being

550
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
annealed to different degrees uh that

551
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
the whole thing it's not possible to

552
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,480
think that the whole thing settles to

553
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,200
like

554
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
you know the lowest possible energy

555
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
state

556
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,080
while it's alive so anyway i don't mean

557
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
to like deflect

558
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
i think what you just brought up is

559
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
really interesting and you probably know

560
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
more about the relevant you know

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
neuronal mechanisms that i do so i can't

562
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
like

563
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,159
critique that idea but it sounds as he

564
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
said copacetic

565
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,919
yeah adam you want to add something

566
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
there oh i mean yeah and i wouldn't want

567
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
to like distract him like the point of

568
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,679
like

569
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,400
if we you actually you have to not be an

570
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
equilibrium you have to have this like

571
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
open endedness and dynamics to keep the

572
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,000
process

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
going um but i and i i don't know

574
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
like how productive like sometimes like

575
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
i'll squint it like

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
different machine learning algorithms

577
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
and like you know

578
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,559
push them a little bit further so like

579
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,840
you could think of this entered a

580
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,880
bayesian model selection it's like a

581
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
kind of annealing

582
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,039
but that could like not be productive

583
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,480
potentially even though aspects of it

584
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,159
could be described that way

585
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,000
yeah well that's a good i mean it's kind

586
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,480
of a good way of framing it like i think

587
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
this goes back to this synchrotis

588
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
cynicism

589
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
thing like you i think you can probably

590
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
always redescribe

591
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,960
something in terms of something else but

592
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
it's a question of how useful it is

593
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
and um and i never exactly know where

594
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
the boundary is right is

595
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
what becomes just kind of a fanciful

596
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
like philosopher's trick versus what's

597
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,880
useful

598
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,080
but the thing that you're suggesting

599
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
sounds like it would be a useful way of

600
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
thinking about things

601
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
and and when i contrast contrast of

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,720
divergence

603
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
and annealing when i think of annealing

604
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
i think of dna

605
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
in the test tube as you turn the

606
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
temperature down so you come to a final

607
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
frozen state that's like a fixed

608
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
crystal essentially whereas the idea of

609
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
contrast of divergence

610
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
it's more like cybernetics it's like a

611
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
guiding in a navigation

612
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,919
on a flow already and so even if you

613
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,000
didn't have any divergence at all

614
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,360
between your north star

615
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
and your header where you're going and

616
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
where you want to go

617
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
you still would be moving and so in that

618
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
sense even if you're trying to minimize

619
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
the divergence

620
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
there still is a sense of movement

621
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,919
whereas in simulated annealing

622
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
the idea that there's no difference is

623
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
more associated with a crystalline or a

624
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,120
static state

625
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,919
so they have very different sort of

626
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,640
telios

627
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
almost and for dynamic systems that

628
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
person going down the stairs

629
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,120
stream of consciousness action selection

630
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
in an uncertain world

631
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
that feels more like the cybernetic

632
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,919
navigation

633
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,400
rather than the dna in a test tube

634
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
though those are just

635
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
some aspects so stephen

636
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
and then adam

637
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,600
that that idea of um how things

638
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,039
keep going and the dynamics um

639
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,600
i'd be interested in your thoughts about

640
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,799
um

641
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,159
how that might play out in in behavior

642
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,000
or in the world so i could imagine in

643
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
the evening being a little bit like if

644
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,200
things are trying to hibernate there may

645
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
be a state

646
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
where they can go closer to like like

647
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
glass glass gets annealed basically

648
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
that's how you plunge into water and it

649
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
it holds that liquid state even though

650
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
it's colder than liquid

651
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,480
but the um the question

652
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,520
i have is is how do you

653
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
reconcile some of these um these these

654
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,960
these

655
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
questions around where we can get caught

656
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
in loops

657
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,679
for instance you know that um casper

658
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,799
hesp talks about

659
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,559
depression where you're seeing

660
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,200
a lack of affordance in the environment

661
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,799
and that could be confirming your

662
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,840
predictions

663
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,559
you can get kind of caught in a loop and

664
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,600
some of those

665
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,640
challenges in computational psychiatry

666
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,520
are they're sort of low energy i

667
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,720
actually haven't got an answer

668
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,559
it's made me think but they're sort of

669
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
low energy states but also like

670
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
looping conformationally states you know

671
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
where you get a reduction in free energy

672
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
relative to some

673
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,240
some sort of stick in the sand that has

674
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
been established for the priors

675
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
and the dynamics and then it kind of

676
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,159
gets stuck in that you know be it

677
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
you know hyperactivity something that's

678
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
outside of where the organism

679
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
want to be but it's still going there

680
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,279
and i know if that's

681
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,760
quite the same as um going into the sort

682
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
of a low energy equilibrium you know

683
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
going to it's not necessarily going down

684
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,559
in energy it's sort of

685
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,200
getting caught in a loop though of

686
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
variational free energy

687
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
yeah that's that's really interesting

688
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
actually um

689
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
sorry it was someone else wanted to oh

690
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,480
no alex you're going to hang up

691
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
and then after your thoughts will go to

692
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,200
adam yeah so i mean my

693
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
my my intuitive reaction is that

694
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
is that yeah something like that happens

695
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
in depression there's a sense in which

696
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
it's a lower energy state um

697
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
in my my paper which is kind of like a

698
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
sophisticated argument for a really

699
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
simple-minded idea i want to identify

700
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,320
that

701
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
those two things and say yeah it's

702
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
physically a low-energy state as well

703
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,880
um but it's a local one so uh

704
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
again this is my intuition at the moment

705
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,400
i don't know if it'll be borne out or if

706
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,120
it'll work

707
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,360
but it seems like sometimes in

708
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,799
depression maybe we reach like a yeah

709
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,720
like a local energy minimum in a certain

710
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
part of the network or something

711
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
but it's not part of an overall optimal

712
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
state for the organism when it comes to

713
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
behavior and things like that

714
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,880
uh it's really interesting to think

715
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
about how that happens

716
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,880
yep thanks adam

717
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,960
um uh actually to speak what uh steven

718
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,400
just mentioned um

719
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
there's a um within like the psychedelic

720
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
uh research communities there's uh

721
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
interesting models based on um

722
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
therapeutic change through annealing

723
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,600
where mike

724
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
johnson at the quality research

725
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,240
institute has something called like the

726
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,960
neural theory

727
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
or theory of annealing where it's the

728
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
psychedelic state increases the

729
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
temperature helps you to break out

730
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,360
and then you can crystallize in your

731
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
regime and uh robin hart harris is

732
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
described in very similar terms

733
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,080
um one uh thing about like

734
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,679
generalizations of annealing

735
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
uh that came to mind um when dan was

736
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,320
talking was

737
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,799
um uh doug hoff setter and melanie

738
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,440
mitchell

739
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,240
um with their copycat architecture um

740
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
they said it's different from annealing

741
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,320
but they had something that was kind of

742
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,080
like ant colony optimization and

743
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,960
kneeling

744
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,080
where there would be a temperature

745
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
parameter for when your analogies

746
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,240
weren't fitting

747
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
and so you can think of like some sort

748
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,279
of contrast of bits saying like how good

749
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,200
is your like matches how good is like

750
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
these analogical matching like discrete

751
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
comparisons

752
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
and then this parameterizes the

753
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,400
temperature of a continuously adjusted

754
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,720
annealing process that doesn't settle

755
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
and and more recently really

756
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,919
interestingly is um

757
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
um well from the beginning the language

758
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,000
was completely like work spaced up

759
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
and uh more recently uh melanie mitchell

760
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,360
has like explicitly drawn a connection

761
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
to the global neural workspace theory

762
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,279
and so there could be like a generalized

763
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,200
annealing that provides

764
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,279
that it has a contrast a bit and an

765
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,400
annealing

766
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
generalized annealing bit that does give

767
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
you like two kinds of like

768
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,919
psychophysical identity mappings maybe

769
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,640
and a total a total speculatory note

770
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,440
would be

771
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
sometimes we have you know accuracy

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,520
minus complexity or pragmatic versus

773
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
epistemic gain

774
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,480
maybe some decision making approaches

775
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,840
are able to hold both together

776
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,159
and maybe even rebalance between those

777
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,000
different modes

778
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
dean i'd like to actually go to 12

779
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
and hear a little bit more on what you

780
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
thought about contrast of diversions

781
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,679
before we head

782
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,799
to the next topic so what

783
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,240
did you see or find interesting on

784
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
slide 12 what brought you to that slide

785
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,360
well

786
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,520
i'd actually looked at stuff from oliver

787
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,640
woodford before

788
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
and so that was kind of why again i was

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
i was sort of i was connecting dots in

790
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
my own head

791
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,880
and it's interesting because the parts

792
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
that adam and

793
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,960
steven just brought up in part in part

794
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
of our conversations

795
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,640
off offline one of the questions i asked

796
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,279
daniel and blue was around the idea so

797
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,880
you have the physical math

798
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,360
and you have the statistical math and

799
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
somehow they come together and make

800
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
babies

801
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,039
and that's what we kind of have here and

802
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,679
so

803
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,360
what is this what is this project and

804
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,240
all i

805
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,480
liked about the not to

806
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,120
not to discount or put aside the

807
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
simulated annealing piece

808
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
but to give what the what i think

809
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,240
happens as a for example when the person

810
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
goes down goes down the stairs under

811
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
control

812
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
as opposed to falling to their death you

813
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,039
know lowest energy state

814
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,080
i thought that this essentially spoke to

815
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,679
it by just giving a nice metaphor in

816
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,480
terms of

817
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,720
shining the the torch beam in our chosen

818
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
direction of travel

819
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,399
which allows us to see the lowest point

820
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,960
in the field in that direction which

821
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,600
i think alex was again addressing i

822
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,880
don't think alex you

823
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,600
meant to make this such a a central

824
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,960
point of your

825
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,960
paper but i i thought in terms of um

826
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,600
trying to explicate the simple idea the

827
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
fact that you

828
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,320
didn't just focus on the fact that

829
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,679
there's a gradient but

830
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,360
how does a person move down that

831
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,799
gradient and not

832
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,440
lose control was kind of what i wanted

833
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
to bring forward here

834
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
and in the notes at the bottom which i

835
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,080
can't see on my screen

836
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,399
there's a really nice explanation for

837
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,600
what

838
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,919
contrast divergence does in terms of

839
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,520
being an assistant

840
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,039
that's why i want to bring that one

841
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,720
forward cool

842
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
alex if you want to give a thought on

843
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
that and then stephen

844
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,279
i don't have much of a thought i mean i

845
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,440
think it's it's a really cool um

846
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
angle that you have on this and it's i

847
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,720
think it's

848
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
again it's it's something that's there

849
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
even if it wasn't my intended focus

850
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,320
and it reinforces i think some of the

851
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,880
themes that i was focusing on

852
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
thanks stephen

853
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,000
so what i think is quite useful

854
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
and i'm kind of be sort of bringing this

855
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
idea if i was trying to explain this to

856
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,960
an arts practitioner or someone in it

857
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,440
does

858
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,559
you know psychotherapy or something

859
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
how to explain the implications and one

860
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,720
thing i think is important

861
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
here when you talk about that energy

862
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,120
minima if i jump to the bottom of a hill

863
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,679
i metaphysically i might know that i'm

864
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,720
at a lower energy

865
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,200
potential energy overall but actually i

866
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
probably get a higher energy when i hit

867
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,240
the floor for a while

868
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,080
right as i start to get stressed and

869
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
perspire and

870
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,799
assuming i'm not just completely

871
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,640
squished to oblivion

872
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
so you're in this interesting you know i

873
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,399
suppose we do that on roller coasters a

874
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,200
little bit

875
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
but we we there is there's what we

876
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,480
are inferring about our states isn't

877
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
what it is because we don't directly

878
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
experience being at the lower energy

879
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,799
state

880
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,919
we experience what our sensorial

881
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,960
states enable us to infer

882
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
about the results of our actions so

883
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,279
and then from that we compare that to

884
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,760
our expectations

885
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,919
based on the stick in the sand or the

886
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,200
big sticks in the sand which is our

887
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,320
phenotype

888
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,039
which is what we can then use as

889
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,960
something to anchor against so i'm

890
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
wondering

891
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,679
that that has an implication about how

892
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,840
people think about the world because of

893
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
these types of ideas

894
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,919
you know there's there's a sense that

895
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,919
they are

896
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,640
connected and interconnected at the same

897
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
time they're always

898
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,279
separate in terms of being able to touch

899
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,320
something

900
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,760
because they're not touching something

901
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
they're getting sensory data

902
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
which makes them get that allows their

903
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
model to predict what they've just done

904
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,360
but they didn't actually touch in the

905
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,799
way that people might think they've

906
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,519
touched

907
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,919
so i'm just putting that out there as

908
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,760
some question

909
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,039
yep alex go for it yeah that

910
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,360
so there's there's this piece um of what

911
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,399
you keep

912
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,919
doing stephen you keep trying to make

913
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,519
this like put

914
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
like put all this in touch with like the

915
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,799
body in the world and stuff and i'm like

916
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,960
no let me just stay in my internal model

917
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,399
and not worry about that

918
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,240
but so i don't know actually i don't

919
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
know if i if i understood the thrust of

920
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
just like the last couple of

921
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
sentences but i think the point that

922
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,039
there's

923
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,640
the fact is we don't we're not yeah we

924
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
don't just want to like

925
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
you know leap to the lowest energy state

926
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,000
possible um

927
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,679
become what may right it's it's much

928
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,120
more about the process

929
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,159
and um i think what you said about the

930
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,279
this thing being anchored in the

931
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
phenotype and you know the priors

932
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,760
in general is is is really important um

933
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,919
one one another paper that i wanted to

934
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,960
write or i don't know if it's a paper

935
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,480
maybe it's just a blog post or a tweet

936
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
or something but

937
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,440
um it's just on the fact that uh

938
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,360
yeah so like you always have to bear in

939
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,399
mind when you're talking about this

940
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,080
energy minimization process that

941
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,679
this is all relative to a phenotype

942
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,360
which itself embodies some amount of

943
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,399
energy

944
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,360
right and so in fact you might even say

945
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
that pheno the stable phenotypes

946
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,880
are some kind of like optimal tradeoff

947
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,799
between accuracy and complexity

948
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,279
right just in themselves um so there's

949
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,640
this force that's sort of pushing up

950
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
from below which is just the

951
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
having a phenotype complex enough to

952
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,440
predict anything and you have to work

953
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,159
within that

954
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,240
like those boundaries so i don't know if

955
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,360
that really addresses your point because

956
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,120
again i totally missed the embodiment

957
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,919
part just like

958
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,960
flew by me but it's it's nice

959
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,600
just one point and then adam so i really

960
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
like that example of

961
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,360
a person or a body in motion going down

962
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
the stairs and the difference between

963
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,480
the controlled walking down the stairs

964
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,399
um or maybe even using an assisted

965
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,760
mobility device

966
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,559
and then falling down the stairs and

967
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,200
both of them

968
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
can't stop at one moment whether you're

969
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
tumbling or whether you're walking you

970
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
still can't stop there

971
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
so it's always dynamical and you are

972
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,599
going downhill

973
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,520
and you are converting your potential

974
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
energy into

975
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
you know going to a lower energy state

976
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,079
so those two

977
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
are good ways to think about where does

978
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,239
bodily control and motor coordination

979
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,719
which we'll talk about in 23 soon with

980
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,079
embodied skillful

981
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
performance but let's think about a

982
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,440
mountain climber

983
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,199
that's somebody who's actually

984
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,719
contrastively diverging

985
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,440
uphill and so that shows us that it's

986
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
not just like

987
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
um the dye is cast and then whether you

988
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
fall or control on the way down

989
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,719
but there's a way in which going to the

990
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,239
top of the mountain

991
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,639
is like going downhill or annealing or

992
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,879
reducing the contrast and divergence

993
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,480
relative to your expectations of where

994
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,599
you want to be

995
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,880
and now you can imagine if the water

996
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,280
level is rising going uphill is the

997
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,800
survival strategy

998
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,200
so we want to have a way of describing

999
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,480
where does control

1000
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,119
and bodily control come into the picture

1001
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,320
going downhill

1002
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,280
and then even generalizing beyond just

1003
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
bodies with mass

1004
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
falling in a controlled or uncontrolled

1005
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,160
fashion towards

1006
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
the kind of cybernetic planning that

1007
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,240
could actually result in a mountain

1008
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,680
climber for example going a little

1009
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,359
downhill and little to the side and then

1010
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,800
making their way up the mountain

1011
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,640
so alex then adam then stephen

1012
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,000
yeah yeah now that's really it's a

1013
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
really good point to bring up especially

1014
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
in this context of

1015
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
you know of the thrust of trying to

1016
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,560
simplify things by identifying physical

1017
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:38,800
and

1018
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
you know psychological things like no

1019
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
sometimes you want to climb the mountain

1020
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,560
so i mean my my my immediate way of

1021
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
trying to summarize how that would work

1022
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,800
is just well you've got

1023
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,760
a strong prediction um that yeah that

1024
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,720
you want to be at the top of the

1025
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
mountain right that's your sort of

1026
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,079
that's your sort of desired distribution

1027
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,920
um it defines your desired distribution

1028
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,119
over observations

1029
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,040
and so that's gonna it's gonna drive you

1030
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
to climb the mountain but i think

1031
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,040
that the way it does that is proximally

1032
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,200
is that there's going to be an actual

1033
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,440
i would say an actual physical uh

1034
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,400
disequilibrium

1035
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,720
in the brain right that's caused by the

1036
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
discrepancy between your predicted state

1037
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
and the state that you're inferring from

1038
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
your observations and

1039
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,760
lowering that uh you know that potential

1040
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,880
uh is what drives the action of actually

1041
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,720
climbing the mountain so

1042
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,920
um yeah

1043
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,880
cool awesome adam and then stephen

1044
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
head's spinning a little bit but

1045
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,839
hopefully this works

1046
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,160
because like up down um but i'm

1047
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
wondering in terms of uh something like

1048
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,720
uh depression um uh

1049
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,920
could we think of it as like a very

1050
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
high local minima

1051
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
and like if we thought of like what we'd

1052
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
expect so i guess okay

1053
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
what is it that's being predicted at

1054
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
which level of

1055
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,640
the degenerative model um like what is

1056
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,359
it they're being

1057
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,520
is what's what's being predicted like

1058
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
and actively

1059
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,240
like between the original niche and

1060
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,680
what's being predicted

1061
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,839
over the you know whole and like skin

1062
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,280
encapsulated organism the

1063
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
brain and then subsystems there could be

1064
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,280
some ultimate they have to come to some

1065
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,320
kind of harmony

1066
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,119
but they they could diverge but um the

1067
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,400
idea would be like thinking

1068
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
of um uh

1069
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
a landscape that like when the energy's

1070
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,280
high it might be

1071
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,359
more jagged and you might be more likely

1072
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,640
to get stuck at like

1073
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,359
uh local you're stuck at this local

1074
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:37,920
minima

1075
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,320
and you want to get to the the a really

1076
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,200
low one

1077
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
and so you could think of something like

1078
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
uh niche construction

1079
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,960
as like looking for a catalyst to like

1080
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,839
try to like

1081
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,160
smooth out like make a more navigable

1082
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,079
landscape or you could think of like

1083
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,359
the psychedelic would be like in turning

1084
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,320
the heat so i'm thinking of the

1085
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,599
difference between like a

1086
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
a thermodynamic versus a kinetically

1087
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
favorable chemical reaction so like

1088
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
you might like yeah it's theory if you

1089
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,440
get from there there you come up ahead

1090
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,320
with the anthem

1091
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,160
with the enthalpy but you can't get

1092
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,920
there it's not kinetically favorable

1093
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
and so like the different things we're

1094
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
doing is trying to like

1095
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,359
uh find ways of getting kinetic

1096
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,200
favorability for thing for this

1097
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,119
thermodynamic favorability and bring

1098
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,280
those into alignment

1099
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,160
very nice atom you can build that bridge

1100
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,839
so you don't have to forward the river

1101
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,480
or swim across or you can just pray for

1102
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
the quantum tunnel

1103
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,119
to appear so i do

1104
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,400
stephen and then dean

1105
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,280
wow okay there's something very

1106
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,400
quite important here i think because

1107
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
okay we're minimizing this energy

1108
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,079
gradient okay that's fair enough

1109
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,920
particularly for robots which are using

1110
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,119
reinforcement

1111
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
approaches and they're basically working

1112
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,880
on energy gradients and then you've got

1113
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,400
the idea okay you can work with

1114
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,000
variational

1115
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,359
approaches i more like this

1116
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,599
gibbs free energy where the reaction can

1117
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,440
slightly have entropy

1118
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,079
but the big key thing as well if you're

1119
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,920
going to take your agent is

1120
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,640
that where at the level of the chemistry

1121
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,280
is the chemistry is all non-equilibrium

1122
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
chemistry so the whole of the gibbs free

1123
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,160
energy is built on equilibrium chemistry

1124
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
here we've got a non-equilibrium

1125
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
chemistry when you get to the level of

1126
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,839
the organisms and cells and

1127
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,480
everything so i think what's an

1128
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,280
interesting

1129
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
point here is so you're going down the

1130
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,720
stairs you're trying to fall over you're

1131
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,240
being a rock climber

1132
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,200
so overall there's this energy piece

1133
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,359
around how the agent moves

1134
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,240
but for the agent to move unlike a robot

1135
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,720
where you might have little pistons

1136
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
the actual cells and that are operating

1137
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
at this non-equilibrium state

1138
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,720
and quite how different actually this

1139
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
gap between

1140
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,599
these attractor basins versus

1141
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,920
energy basins which we normally think of

1142
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
i actually don't know

1143
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
i don't know i'm interested to ask carl

1144
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,160
fristan that like what is

1145
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,400
how how much does it shift things to

1146
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,280
have and

1147
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,040
basins are to do with the tractors as

1148
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,200
opposed to just basins to do with energy

1149
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
like equilibrium energy gradients um

1150
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,040
and and that's the thing that's

1151
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,480
different in terms of what's really

1152
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
going on when i'm climbing a mountain or

1153
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,960
that

1154
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,560
is all my muscles and that at the actual

1155
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,359
level of making things happen a swarming

1156
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,560
and trying to enable this kind of

1157
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,839
biological process to happen and okay

1158
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,839
from a system perspective i can see the

1159
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,760
energy being less for me falling on the

1160
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,119
ground

1161
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,880
but for my muscles to move and

1162
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
everything

1163
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,640
um they're they're operating at this

1164
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,960
non-equilibrium

1165
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,240
process and which will have energy

1166
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
impacts but also

1167
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
as some other types of dynamics which

1168
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,760
you don't have you have this

1169
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,000
non-equilibrium steady state dynamic

1170
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,319
which you don't get in traditional

1171
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,359
chemistry

1172
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,359
so there's something there i just

1173
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,040
thought i'm not saying i expect an

1174
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,560
answer from that but i think it's a

1175
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
it's an important point that seems to be

1176
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,079
a gap it just it really

1177
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,680
shun out for me there nice thanks steven

1178
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,119
it's kind of like if it's a ball

1179
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,520
at the bottom of a bowl then it's it's

1180
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,480
that's the annealing

1181
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,240
it's the crystal state with the ball and

1182
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,720
the bowl but then if you have a neuron

1183
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,920
that's holding a resting voltage that is

1184
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
being actively maintained

1185
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,400
with an enormous expenditure of energy

1186
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
but it's its own kind of

1187
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,640
bowl that it's converging to whether

1188
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,000
it's above or below

1189
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,119
its set point it's still doing a type of

1190
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,079
convergence but it's a dynamically held

1191
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,640
state

1192
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,319
and you're absolutely right that

1193
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,760
sometimes the lower level

1194
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,000
entity or the entity which the larger

1195
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,280
one is composed of

1196
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
they have their own active dynamics even

1197
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
when the top

1198
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,000
level system is at rest or appears to be

1199
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,880
unmoving

1200
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,599
so dean and then we have a few other fun

1201
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,400
topics that we'll get to

1202
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,599
well i'm gonna see if it's okay to

1203
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,079
ask ask alex to jump to his third rail

1204
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,760
at this point because i'm really really

1205
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
curious about the modified ramsey

1206
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:11,680
sentence

1207
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,160
uh aspect of his paper and what i was

1208
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,319
hoping he might be able to speak to a

1209
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,480
little bit about is

1210
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,160
not just what that what the ramsay

1211
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,839
sentence is talking about but

1212
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,480
the implications in terms of different

1213
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,240
time intervals and what that

1214
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,800
role that plays in us being able to

1215
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,640
understand how

1216
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,680
the modified ramsay sentence works in

1217
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,880
your paper

1218
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,880
perfect i switched to that slide um 44.

1219
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,119
so yeah i was definitely curious about

1220
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,960
that as well alex what does the

1221
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,200
ramsay sentence or this entire area of

1222
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,160
formal logic how did that come into play

1223
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
yeah so right i kind of trumped up the

1224
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,760
ramsay sentence thing in the last

1225
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
episode but um

1226
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
it's kind of silly of me because there's

1227
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
not a whole lot to it

1228
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,560
in a way but then maybe that's just how

1229
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,920
it seems to me from

1230
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,800
the perspective of where i'm coming from

1231
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,200
but

1232
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,520
the reason this is in here is that the

1233
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,760
whole identity the philosophical

1234
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,359
mind brain identity piece of this was

1235
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,920
based on i was mostly inspired by david

1236
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,680
lewis's approach to that topic

1237
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,119
and so there there are a couple of

1238
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,560
influential approaches approaches

1239
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,480
there's lewis's and there's um

1240
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,400
uh smart i guess the two big papers um

1241
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,359
but basically uh what but this piece of

1242
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,000
formal logic

1243
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,400
is doing is just trying to capture what

1244
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,520
um what a theory

1245
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,839
says about the entities that it sort of

1246
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,440
implicitly defines

1247
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,119
or how you could get from um

1248
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,040
this isn't all explicitly spelled out

1249
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,640
graphically but how you could get from

1250
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,720
just a collection of statements that you

1251
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,920
might have sent to about

1252
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
whatever the topic happens to be in this

1253
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,839
case we're talking about mental states

1254
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,280
from that to a uh

1255
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,040
a theory that's um expressed in general

1256
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
terms and that

1257
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
again implicitly defines the uh

1258
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,760
the entities that figure as the values

1259
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
of these variables here

1260
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
um so the right so i mean we could

1261
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,319
briefly talk about this i guess is it

1262
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,000
useful to go over this

1263
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,960
yeah you guys yeah so um read out the

1264
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,599
sentence

1265
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,160
um or translate it or provide an example

1266
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,160
sure um so right so i guess i'll start

1267
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,599
with just the ramsay sentence so we can

1268
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,960
talk about modified

1269
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,359
versions in a second but um so the first

1270
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,640
symbol here as you guys discussed in

1271
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,000
point zero is just an existential

1272
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,200
quantifier it says

1273
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
there's some x such that whatever

1274
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,280
follows uh the second symbol is a

1275
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
universal quantifier over the variable y

1276
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
so it says there's some x such that for

1277
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,319
all y

1278
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,440
blah blah blah and here t the predicate

1279
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,359
is just literally like so say that you

1280
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,359
had a collection of platitudes or

1281
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,720
they don't i don't want to complicate

1282
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,400
things just a collection of statements

1283
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,960
like uh um when i see

1284
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,240
uh when i see a cat i'm happy uh when i

1285
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,359
think about happiness

1286
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,160
uh i tend to think about sunshine things

1287
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,119
like that right

1288
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,480
just some examples um and so you just

1289
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,000
can join all those just put an and

1290
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,119
between

1291
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,800
all of the sentences of that type that

1292
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,640
you could think of in this domain in

1293
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,480
this case it's folk psychology

1294
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,000
um so then you'd have you'd have a

1295
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,960
a uh a long sentence right it's a giant

1296
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,319
conjunction now

1297
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,480
uh that has some terms that refer to

1298
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,920
mental states like

1299
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,560
uh believe arguably see although maybe

1300
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,680
some people interpret that

1301
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,520
as a physical state there's definitely

1302
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,359
blurry blurriness here at the edges

1303
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,720
but in any case things like believe

1304
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,560
desire think these are clearly mental

1305
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,920
state terms right

1306
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,200
so you'd have this long sentence that

1307
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
has those terms and also other terms

1308
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,680
and so essentially you just you replace

1309
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,359
each of the the

1310
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,880
terms in question the mental state terms

1311
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,040
with a variable and what's left over is

1312
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,319
the predicate

1313
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,200
that defines what the sentence is saying

1314
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,920
about those

1315
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,760
the values of those variables right and

1316
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,480
then you just append these quantifiers

1317
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
to the beginning um just to sort of

1318
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,160
spell out

1319
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
um what your what kind of claim you're

1320
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,920
making um about

1321
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,400
the states in question namely there is

1322
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,280
such a

1323
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
there is something such that it relates

1324
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,440
to all other things in this way

1325
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,920
um and so that's that's the basic ramsey

1326
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,839
sends it's just a um

1327
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
it's an abstraction that allows you to

1328
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,079
um to spell out in formal logic and

1329
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:22,800
first order

1330
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
practical logic uh like what a

1331
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,920
collection of sentences says about

1332
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,640
something

1333
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,319
um and the and the last piece here is

1334
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,000
the so there's the if and only if the

1335
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,040
three bars

1336
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,200
um that's the resellian uniqueness

1337
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,800
condition so this goes back to

1338
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,839
russell's theory of definite

1339
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,400
descriptions so like i got i mean my

1340
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,599
start by the way was in sort of

1341
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,000
philosophy

1342
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,359
of language and stuff so that's why this

1343
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,440
is in here i came to the

1344
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,119
all this sort of statistics and physics

1345
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,560
space stuff much later

1346
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,520
um so so russell you know had this this

1347
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,040
theory of definite descriptions

1348
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,520
uh that he was trying to explain how you

1349
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,079
could

1350
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,640
have a meaningful expression uh like you

1351
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,400
know the present king of france

1352
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,800
um even though there is no such thing so

1353
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,119
how does how do failures of reference

1354
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,800
how do we philosophically handle

1355
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,160
failures of reference and things like

1356
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,359
that

1357
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,400
um and so his his suggestion was that

1358
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
um you can think of definite

1359
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,319
descriptions like the present king of

1360
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,240
france as

1361
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,720
uh just saying well there is something

1362
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,440
such that

1363
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,599
it is a present king of france and

1364
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,440
there's only one of those things

1365
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,200
right so it's like a uniquely satisfied

1366
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,839
description and so that's what this

1367
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,319
end part does here it says this

1368
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,440
predicate t which

1369
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,119
encompasses all of the implicit folk

1370
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,640
knowledge about mental states in this

1371
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,520
case

1372
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,760
uh holds uh holds of something only if

1373
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,240
that thing is equal to x

1374
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,000
and so one last piece that's important

1375
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,839
here is that

1376
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,319
i took x the the bold letters here x and

1377
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:50,960
y to be

1378
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,000
like uh vectors

1379
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
essentially right so like these are

1380
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,200
we're talking about many different

1381
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,079
mental states

1382
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,160
in parallel we do this uh but if you

1383
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,000
want to you can just think of it simply

1384
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,680
as being about one mental state but then

1385
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,720
you generalize to

1386
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,720
all of them so i don't know where

1387
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,400
how clear is that what what what

1388
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,760
it's it's let me try a uh

1389
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,599
a little bit of a physical example it's

1390
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,359
like there's the stream of consciousness

1391
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,800
the stream of statements what you said

1392
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,520
with an ant

1393
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,119
i saw a cat or photons hit my eye

1394
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,280
and i perceived a cat so one of those is

1395
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,960
more of a physicalist claim

1396
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,960
and one of those is more on a mental

1397
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,640
side and it's almost like

1398
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,000
we're going to draw a line around

1399
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,800
the mental claims just so that they can

1400
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,520
be

1401
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,480
definitely interfaced into a formal

1402
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,440
logic

1403
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,079
even if the contents of that mental

1404
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,440
experience

1405
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,240
might not even have a reference in the

1406
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,359
real world

1407
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
or it might not be something that exists

1408
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
in the same way that those photons

1409
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,680
hitting the eyes

1410
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,319
exist but it allows us to interface with

1411
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,839
those kinds of statements

1412
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,760
by agents in a formal logical framework

1413
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,400
well i mean i guess one part i'd push

1414
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,440
back on a bit is

1415
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,559
i mean this sentence here clearly states

1416
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,440
that

1417
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
that this x exists whatever you take

1418
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,880
that to mean right so it could be that

1419
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,960
there's different criteria for existence

1420
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,880
right in different domains or something

1421
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,119
but it definitely said that that there

1422
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,119
exists something such that it's related

1423
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,839
to all the other things of this kind and

1424
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,280
in the ways that are specified in the

1425
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,079
predicate

1426
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,480
so like yeah i think i think the

1427
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,400
the the main i guess the main point here

1428
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,240
i so i focused on the ramsey sentence

1429
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,599
because people were interested in it but

1430
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,760
like the main point is just

1431
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,599
um that you can take all the things that

1432
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,160
people

1433
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,119
say about mental states as implicitly

1434
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,079
defining them

1435
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,800
in a sort of theory right and that

1436
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,839
that's

1437
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,280
uh that's um

1438
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,040
and so lewis used this explicitly in the

1439
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,640
context of trying to identify mental

1440
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,680
states with brain states

1441
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,599
right so just to i'll just say a little

1442
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,640
bit more about this piece and then i'll

1443
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,920
shut up for a bit but

1444
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,480
like um if you have this network of

1445
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,079
relations that's described by a sentence

1446
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,040
like this

1447
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,960
uh you can take that as implicitly

1448
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,040
defining the mental states while being

1449
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,800
neutral about their sort of ontological

1450
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,559
character right so

1451
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,040
um so it could be then that if you do

1452
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,680
some

1453
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,520
you know neuroscientific investigation

1454
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,440
and you find hey there are these

1455
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,839
you know states in the brain that are

1456
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,359
they seem to bear the same relations to

1457
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,800
one another that

1458
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
these mental states that we were talking

1459
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,720
about bear to one another

1460
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,839
uh you know lewis says well then

1461
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,079
because this the sentence says that the

1462
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,599
mental states really are just the things

1463
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,200
that uniquely realize this structure of

1464
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,000
relations

1465
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,599
well you've just empirically discovered

1466
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,680
the mental states

1467
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,920
um so it's a really cool way of

1468
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,280
theoretically bridging

1469
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,160
um something like psychology intuitive

1470
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,640
folk psychology and and neuroscience and

1471
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,079
lewis's point was

1472
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,680
once you have this structure if you

1473
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,040
could extract this structure from folk

1474
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
psychology that's implicit in it

1475
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,559
and if you made the empirical discovery

1476
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,319
there'd be no further bells or whistles

1477
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,839
whistles needed to say that there's an

1478
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,800
identity between them because

1479
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,079
that's just what the sentence says is

1480
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,760
that the mental states are whatever

1481
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,839
things satisfy this um

1482
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,040
description very interesting so

1483
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,400
dean then stephen then adam

1484
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,200
yeah so so alex i mean as it's as it's

1485
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,240
written out here it's

1486
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,079
it's really stable and i'm i'm really

1487
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,480
curious because i really don't know this

1488
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,960
do different time intervals like really

1489
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,640
really short time intervals

1490
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,480
or longer time intervals if i've got a

1491
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,280
day to go down the stairs versus

1492
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,000
i've got one second to decide whether

1493
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,160
the 96 inch drop

1494
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,280
is less harmful to me than the lion

1495
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,480
that's chasing me

1496
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,319
do time intervals affect the stability

1497
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,680
of this right yeah so sorry i neglected

1498
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,520
that part of your comment earlier um

1499
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,640
i think no is the short answer i think

1500
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
that this is meant to be a static

1501
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,200
a static sort of description of a

1502
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,480
implicit theory

1503
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,000
right which which will include

1504
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,240
statements about short time scales and

1505
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,599
long time skills

1506
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,440
so i would say that that anything about

1507
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,720
time scales

1508
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,040
in theory should be captured by the folk

1509
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,640
psychology that you

1510
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,160
embody or that you have in mind at the

1511
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,000
moment and that might change from one

1512
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,800
time

1513
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,720
moment to the next also like this

1514
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,240
doesn't need to be a temporary static

1515
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,119
structure

1516
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,359
so maybe that speaks more your point but

1517
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,400
um

1518
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,280
but i think the possibility of of

1519
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
spelling this structure out even for one

1520
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,400
instant is the is the is the lever that

1521
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,800
lewis uses to to draw his philosophical

1522
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,960
conclusions

1523
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,839
okay thanks thanks steven and then

1524
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
adam

1525
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,440
this question about

1526
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,640
prediction and time i think like you

1527
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
just saying

1528
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
there may be a sort of time scale at

1529
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,880
which things are just flowing

1530
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,920
like what sort of speed is it that

1531
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,119
things are just doing their thing i.e

1532
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,160
cells are doing their processes but what

1533
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,680
dean was talking about was

1534
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,599
is longer time scales than that and i

1535
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,040
think like you say there's something

1536
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,040
different there that's a more

1537
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,720
everything beyond a certain point has to

1538
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,880
be imagined i suppose

1539
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,520
anything that's not possible to do

1540
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,599
variational free energy on

1541
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,119
you've got to do expected free energy

1542
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,559
and to do expected free energy you

1543
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,720
basically have to imagine

1544
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,559
some a big us imagine in a different way

1545
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,119
to just our limited sense of imagination

1546
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,200
like our body has to imagine at some

1547
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,640
level

1548
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,720
the expected free energy basically what

1549
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,480
expected free energy is

1550
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,200
so i think that's um that then does

1551
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,720
bring in some interesting

1552
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,839
ideas around folk psychology would you

1553
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,559
say

1554
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,599
that those mental states can ultimately

1555
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,720
be action

1556
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,480
and sensory states that are being

1557
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,880
predicted so the mental states are

1558
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,319
basically

1559
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,599
the recapitulation or expectation on

1560
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,960
sensory states and resulting beliefs on

1561
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,800
action states

1562
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,040
so they they could be seen as mental

1563
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,400
states but actually there is a more

1564
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,240
distributed

1565
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
realization of that i'll be interested

1566
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,319
if that that sort of

1567
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,960
is something that could hold yeah i mean

1568
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,839
i think

1569
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,440
that the spirit of lewis's proposal is

1570
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,839
also functionalist right so

1571
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,400
so the the basic idea functionalism of

1572
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,359
course is that the

1573
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,359
mental states in the philosophy of mind

1574
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,960
is that mental states can be defined in

1575
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,920
terms of their

1576
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,680
relations to inputs and outputs and also

1577
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,599
to each other and it's i guess it's the

1578
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,319
to each other

1579
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,359
bit that distinguishes it from

1580
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,760
behaviorism so um

1581
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,000
but yeah i think the these implicit

1582
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,880
definitions

1583
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
that lewis talks about would rely

1584
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
heavily it would depend heavily on

1585
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,520
things like um when i believe that

1586
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,119
there's a cat present i expect

1587
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,319
certain visual appearances to occur

1588
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,400
um and i'm disposed to act in certain

1589
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,319
ways and

1590
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,400
maybe you want to catch the the i i tend

1591
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,680
to want to cache the actions and the

1592
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,520
sensory stuff out in terms of

1593
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,000
proximal stimuli and like motor effector

1594
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,880
states rather than

1595
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,040
distal things and extended things that's

1596
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,160
just i

1597
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,680
i don't know that's my my my um

1598
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,799
i don't know if it's a bias or what

1599
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,280
that's just the way i i tend to think of

1600
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,799
these things but

1601
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,559
um definitely

1602
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,400
i i guess i would say that

1603
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,000
the the relations between the mental

1604
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,440
states though are just as important as

1605
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
the relation to

1606
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,880
uh the active states from the sensory

1607
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,400
states um

1608
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,680
when it comes to this kind of um

1609
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,359
this kind of formalism um

1610
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,839
i feel like i missed an opportunity to

1611
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,119
it was a really interesting comment

1612
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:55,680
actually i

1613
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,280
i don't know if i did it justice but i'm

1614
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,359
still thinking about it can i just

1615
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,720
just add one little things like just

1616
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,400
before yeah

1617
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,720
okay very quickly but one thing that

1618
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,000
comes to mind that i i

1619
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,760
think might connect what you're saying

1620
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,960
um you were talking about this and

1621
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,599
and and so there seems to be something

1622
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,599
there about

1623
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,680
um the combination of ands

1624
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,880
um and what's you know

1625
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,480
so for instance and there was a dog and

1626
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,079
there was a woman with the dog and were

1627
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,760
in the park

1628
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,799
and the dog was wagging its tail

1629
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,200
and then there was blood on its teeth

1630
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,240
when it smiled

1631
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,160
and i'm like suddenly that changed it

1632
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,440
right so the triangulation of the ands

1633
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,920
flips once you suddenly the dog bears

1634
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,359
its teeth and you see blood on them

1635
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,319
right

1636
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,799
so that links into what they do in

1637
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,400
qualitative research

1638
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
where they often triangulate to get

1639
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,880
something which has got

1640
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,720
trustworthiness rather than accuracy um

1641
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,000
and i think there's something

1642
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
interesting there about

1643
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,920
um what you're saying in terms of that

1644
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,040
my knowledge of

1645
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,520
that field of linguistics is but i if i

1646
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,359
can bring it back into embodied work i

1647
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,559
find it easier which is what i'm trying

1648
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,440
to do but

1649
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,559
this and and and and that's that has got

1650
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,440
some practical

1651
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
applications i think in um in a number

1652
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,960
of areas

1653
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,920
definitely yep thanks adam um if you can

1654
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,799
return yep

1655
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,720
okay go for it adam hey making coffee

1656
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,280
so um eventually i'd like to get to um

1657
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,760
free will and actually uh loop around a

1658
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,960
little bit to actually depression

1659
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,079
as a case with respect to that but

1660
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,839
um before we move on from ramsey's

1661
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,200
sentences um

1662
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,920
uh not to belabor it but so it is the

1663
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,799
idea that

1664
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,760
so you strip away the specific entities

1665
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
being signified

1666
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,240
you look at the syntax and then you're

1667
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,720
saying it can the same syntax apply

1668
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,119
in another system and then you have the

1669
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,319
mapping that

1670
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,599
this would be the map and so that would

1671
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,000
is that the basic idea essentially yeah

1672
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,760
if you take syntax in a you know in a

1673
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,920
slightly broad sense

1674
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,640
then totally yeah okay so i guess i'd be

1675
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,760
wondering like um

1676
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,359
like in terms of like active inferential

1677
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,520
modeling would it be something like um

1678
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,040
like with like the graphical brain like

1679
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,880
you have like this forney factor graph

1680
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,640
where you have like the continuous

1681
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,920
regime down below but then you have this

1682
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,839
like discrete regime up top

1683
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,839
and that maybe something in like the

1684
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,119
factor graph portion

1685
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,280
you can look for like some sort of like

1686
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,559
uh

1687
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,119
homomorphism or isomorphism there or

1688
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,480
like if it's the brain

1689
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,480
you would do some sort of like you would

1690
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,680
look at ensembles

1691
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,440
and like describe them as like

1692
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,040
attractors moving along some sort of

1693
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,760
manifold

1694
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,599
and then like when you core screen those

1695
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,839
or throw a blanket around them or reify

1696
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:48,799
them in some ways

1697
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,799
if the syntax of their interrelations

1698
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,720
matches people's

1699
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,760
uh uh subjective reports of their

1700
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,359
experience

1701
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,200
then you would be able to actually

1702
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,559
potentially identify like

1703
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,319
physical sub physical and computational

1704
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,640
substrates of consciousness is that

1705
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,280
i mean yeah i have a bridge too far or

1706
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,359
like that well there we're going

1707
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,280
that's i think that's where where we're

1708
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,720
going except uh

1709
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,480
i never made the bridge all the way to

1710
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,920
consciousness because

1711
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,680
that's one thing that i i reserve the

1712
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,839
right to not decide about i think your

1713
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,280
work on this is really cool actually i

1714
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,720
kind of suspect that like most of the

1715
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,240
main theories of consciousness are kind

1716
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,960
of

1717
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,359
overlap a bit and there's a core that's

1718
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,559
you know

1719
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,599
that's sort of like uh getting at the

1720
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,000
way things

1721
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,200
are which i think you've written about

1722
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,920
but um so so i want to just bracket the

1723
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,119
consciousness thing for a second

1724
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,880
although maybe that totally ruins it for

1725
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,680
you i don't know

1726
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,319
but like i think yeah but that's that's

1727
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:42,880
exactly

1728
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,640
the idea like i think you just expressed

1729
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,000
it very well

1730
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,520
that um if you look with

1731
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,720
yeah you have to squint you have to do

1732
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,559
some coarse graining but if you look at

1733
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,640
the dynamics of the physical system

1734
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,720
uh you'll be able to discover in the

1735
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,319
ideal case some of the same

1736
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,480
sort of syntactic relations that you

1737
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,920
would get from the psychological

1738
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,440
perspective and i think that's also very

1739
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,880
constant with the way

1740
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,720
you know connectionist modelers describe

1741
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,160
their work sometimes so like

1742
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,599
you know you think a connection is a

1743
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,599
simple you know neural network made up

1744
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:11,920
these

1745
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,559
simple processing units uh you can

1746
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,160
derive that architecture just by looking

1747
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,839
at the brain and sort of

1748
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,400
very much simplifying things or you

1749
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,880
could

1750
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,000
derive the same graphs in some case just

1751
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
by looking at cognitive processes

1752
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,440
and so you know it's the idea that you

1753
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,799
have two perspectives on one thing

1754
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,680
exactly

1755
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,119
if you have a graph isomorphism then

1756
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,359
that is what was being hinted at with it

1757
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,240
being sufficient

1758
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,920
to find that there's relationships

1759
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,280
amongst mental states

1760
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,920
like i always feel like i feel this way

1761
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,440
before this other feeling

1762
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,480
and then if you found that there was

1763
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,160
some brain state that always preceded

1764
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,160
is that the end point or is there still

1765
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,559
more to explain in that context

1766
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,480
let's actually get to another topic that

1767
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,240
we highlighted last week

1768
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,280
which was the sleep wake example so i'm

1769
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,160
here on

1770
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,599
slide 40 and we're considering a system

1771
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,079
whose analysis is tractable at least

1772
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,920
according to alex

1773
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,960
and we have an agent whose behavior

1774
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,200
as far as sleep wake is concerned is

1775
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,400
defined by equation

1776
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,760
3.1 so could we walk through what is

1777
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,480
happening

1778
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,400
in this simulation like what is the

1779
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,079
agent doing what does the agent

1780
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,040
consist of and then what does the

1781
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,160
equation show

1782
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,000
and then how does that relate to what

1783
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,200
we're showing in this paper

1784
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,240
sure so i think i think this is another

1785
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,359
aspect of the paper that

1786
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,079
um that was uh

1787
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,400
maybe seemed to be a making a deeper

1788
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,760
point than it was but

1789
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,319
i'll just talk about this yeah briefly

1790
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,559
so this was actually just meant to be

1791
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,160
uh sort of a slight modification

1792
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,400
of just like a helmholtz machine running

1793
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,960
the wake sleep algorithm

1794
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,400
so i don't know if i need to set that up

1795
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,839
blue talked about that a little bit in

1796
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,240
the point zero um

1797
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,920
but the idea was if we just have a

1798
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,240
generic let's we have a neural network

1799
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,640
that has a generative model that's sort

1800
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,280
of

1801
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,960
encoded in its top-down connections and

1802
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
a approximate recognition

1803
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,039
model in the bottom up connections and

1804
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,640
um

1805
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,480
so so one way of doing this is to run

1806
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,000
the wake sleep algorithm where you

1807
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,359
basically generate

1808
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,680
uh states of the network top down like

1809
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,880
fantasies right

1810
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,559
functionally speaking and then you

1811
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:29,760
adjust the bottom up weights so that

1812
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,799
they're likely to produce those

1813
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,839
fantasies

1814
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,559
and then you you alternate this with a

1815
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,000
so that's the sleep cycle

1816
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,359
you alternate this with a wake cycle

1817
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,359
where you use it input

1818
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,760
of the kind of sensory data you want the

1819
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,359
model to learn to

1820
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,480
generate and you do a bottom-up pass

1821
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,240
and then adjust the the top down

1822
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,280
generative connection so that they're

1823
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,880
more likely to produce those

1824
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,520
states that are induced by input okay so

1825
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,000
um so all i was doing here was saying

1826
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,400
uh look if we if we suppose just make

1827
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,680
the assumption that this is a real

1828
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,039
system we're talking about it's

1829
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,720
ridiculously unrealistic right so this

1830
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,400
that's why i said it's

1831
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,240
uh it's it's something that's tractable

1832
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,680
to analyze but it's also

1833
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,440
also quite a far cry from you know

1834
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,799
anything biologically possible

1835
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,480
but it's not also it's also not

1836
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,160
completely off the mark right so i think

1837
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,280
there's a reason that the helmholtz

1838
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,280
machine was kind of like

1839
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,000
a seminal moment in the evolution

1840
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,599
towards what we have now

1841
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,839
um because it got a lot of the coarse

1842
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:24,720
grained

1843
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,599
um sort of conceptual structure really

1844
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,200
down that i don't know if it had been

1845
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,000
pulled together before

1846
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,760
in this form anyway so let's suppose

1847
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,359
that the wake and sleep cycles of that

1848
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,400
machine

1849
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,599
uh occur with equal probability then we

1850
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:38,559
can talk about

1851
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,000
probabilities of certain states

1852
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,599
occurring in the network just

1853
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,200
period right whether it's during a sleep

1854
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,920
or a week cycle um and so if you just

1855
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,160
grant that if you if you ignore the fact

1856
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,200
that this is a

1857
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,000
really only it ends up being an

1858
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,079
approximation to an approximation right

1859
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,039
so it's

1860
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,799
it's um it's running it's uh wake sleep

1861
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,119
um

1862
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,760
ends up being sort of an approximation

1863
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,240
to the em algorithm which is itself

1864
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,680
not quite full variational base so

1865
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,079
anyway lots of approximations but if you

1866
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:12,720
ignore that

1867
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,079
for the moment i just wanted to make the

1868
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,839
point that you could talk you could talk

1869
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,119
about the

1870
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,200
you can thoroughly completely

1871
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,720
characterize the possib the

1872
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,559
probabilities of various states of the

1873
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,359
system

1874
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,680
and so you could use that to define this

1875
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,000
this r here is just the probability

1876
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,720
of a certain state of of the system

1877
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,640
being in a certain state now here the si

1878
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,920
is referred to like the states of the

1879
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,200
individual neurons

1880
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,039
but that's related in a simple way to

1881
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,880
the overall state of the network

1882
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,760
um so you can talk about the probability

1883
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,960
of the system being in one of these

1884
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,599
states

1885
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,000
um regardless of whether it's running

1886
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,599
awake or a sleep cycle and then

1887
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,760
that gives you a if you have a

1888
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,200
probabilistic description of the states

1889
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,559
of the whole system

1890
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,480
uh then you could you could use that

1891
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,799
as as um

1892
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,640
to define the the relevant terms in the

1893
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,000
thermodynamic uh

1894
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,920
free energy so the entropy and the

1895
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,079
energy and such

1896
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,920
so that's the basic idea but the the

1897
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,680
part that you

1898
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,240
that you were wondering about like what

1899
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,280
is this um

1900
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
system simulating what does it perceive

1901
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,400
and such

1902
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
that's all that's this example is

1903
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,839
completely agnostic as to any of those

1904
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,200
details

1905
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,720
so once again this is highly highly

1906
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
abstract and i apologize

1907
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,280
no it's cool and what do you think this

1908
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,119
model would

1909
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,280
allow us to continue developing towards

1910
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,640
or what does it show

1911
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,559
for the argument that you put forth as

1912
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,240
far as the psychophysical identity

1913
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,920
thesis

1914
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,160
right well i i don't know that it shows

1915
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,680
anything in itself i think what was what

1916
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,079
it was

1917
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,839
trying to do was was was write down

1918
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,839
a system in which the target would be

1919
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,359
clear so like

1920
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,400
the you want to be the case that this r

1921
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,140
distribution um

1922
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:59,199
[Music]

1923
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,880
so so let me put this way so the r

1924
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,559
distribution because it's

1925
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,520
it's essentially made up of or it's it's

1926
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,480
factored into

1927
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,359
these wake and sleep cycles right those

1928
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,559
have direct

1929
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,960
um interpretations in terms of

1930
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,359
variational free energy and inference

1931
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,760
um and yet we we have a well-defined

1932
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,039
distribution over the states of the

1933
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:19,920
system

1934
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,839
that we could use to describe its

1935
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,200
physics so i just wanted to show that

1936
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,079
there's one

1937
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,680
simple case where where we can we can

1938
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,200
write down a distribution that bridges

1939
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,799
these two descriptions

1940
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,119
and then uh then in the subsequent

1941
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,720
paragraphs i try to

1942
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,720
i try to argue that we can generalize

1943
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,119
this beyond equilibrium and that's the

1944
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,280
that's that's the very tricky bit and i

1945
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,039
don't claim to have shown it by any

1946
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,079
means i'm just

1947
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,760
again i was trying to remove obvious

1948
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,319
obstacles to this thesis being true

1949
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,960
awesome so adam with a raised hand and

1950
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,200
then blue or if anybody else wants to go

1951
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,520
for it

1952
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,760
um in terms of um wake sleep

1953
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,880
uh there could be some uh potentially

1954
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,680
biologically

1955
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,200
realistic implementations of something

1956
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,799
like that um o'reilly and

1957
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,640
um has a paper uh deep predictive

1958
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,640
learning where he describes

1959
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,520
a model of the thermocourtical system

1960
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,280
doing predictive processing that's

1961
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,319
a very weak slate a wake sleep-esque i'd

1962
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,599
be um

1963
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,119
i'll send that to be curious enough if

1964
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,559
you like if you thought that was like a

1965
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,480
good like psychophysical identity

1966
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,720
mapping there the other uh

1967
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,000
thing would be um so

1968
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,240
if

1969
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:42,400
if we think of experience as being

1970
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,599
the ramsification of experience with the

1971
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:46,640
mapping would happen at the level of

1972
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,839
predictions

1973
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,599
um then and if the predictions

1974
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,880
are the uh sleep part um

1975
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,480
is there a sense that experience is

1976
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,319
always like kind of paradoxically it's

1977
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,359
always the dream

1978
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,920
like the awake part is the stuff that's

1979
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,520
just updating it but the actual thing

1980
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,039
generating the experience

1981
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,079
is the dream part like correct or yeah

1982
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,079
no i yeah so i i have an unpublished

1983
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,280
paper on this too on the

1984
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,359
representational division of labor like

1985
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,238
so people like in predictive processing

1986
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:17,679
literature say things like

1987
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,359
yeah we experience our expectations of

1988
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,439
the world or whatever but i'm not

1989
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,120
i'm not so clear that it's that way i

1990
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,640
don't know um

1991
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,000
i guess if you think that the

1992
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
predictions are the carriers of the

1993
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,198
experience or the

1994
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,640
neural correlates of the experience or

1995
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,319
something then then that would be

1996
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,080
the case and the wake cycle would do

1997
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,479
nothing but i think it's

1998
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,479
i don't i don't see the reason to

1999
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,600
embrace that that

2000
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,120
that interpretation of of what's going

2001
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,479
on here

2002
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,319
um because it's awesome

2003
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,198
no i mean i'm all about no no i'm all

2004
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,799
i'm all about the idea that that

2005
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,359
we experience sort of virtual models in

2006
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:55,920
a way

2007
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,560
right that's that's cool i just i i

2008
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,238
don't interpret that in terms of like

2009
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,600
it's just the

2010
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,279
it's just the top-down driving signal

2011
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,040
that leads to experience although

2012
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,960
maybe i'm not really against that either

2013
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,719
and i can see why you'd want to say that

2014
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,799
um anyway i just don't think that

2015
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,000
there's any inference from like the

2016
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,960
helmholtz machine

2017
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,319
to that like because and i would love to

2018
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,439
look at this paper you mentioned by the

2019
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,158
way on like

2020
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,238
biologically plausible versions of this

2021
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,600
because i think there's a lot that's

2022
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,880
right about the only the reason i say

2023
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,359
it's so

2024
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,198
impossible is just that it doesn't have

2025
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,880
any role for

2026
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,040
top-down modulation of bottom-up signals

2027
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,040
during perception

2028
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,279
which was by design so that it would

2029
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,719
work quickly

2030
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,600
um but that's the main limitation that

2031
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,679
concerns me

2032
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,198
um cool thank you alex

2033
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:44,960
steven with a raised hand and then

2034
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,120
anyone else and also anybody watching

2035
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,799
live you're more than welcome to

2036
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,238
write a question in a live chat so

2037
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,040
stephen go for it

2038
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,040
just uh just to help me clarify so

2039
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,640
this being an attractable

2040
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,400
pro analysis so the key the key point

2041
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,159
is that by going to stochastic

2042
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,440
it shows in principle how

2043
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,600
recognition and generative densities can

2044
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,800
be used together

2045
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,600
is that the kind of the point that this

2046
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,120
shows

2047
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,679
i just because i'm struggling i think

2048
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,520
i'm just i'm not so good with the

2049
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,440
formulas and to exactly get it but i

2050
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,120
think the general point you're making is

2051
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,440
that

2052
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,239
you're going to stochastic algorithms

2053
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,600
and therefore

2054
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,920
you've got this potential for the

2055
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,760
recognition and generative densities

2056
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,480
which is basically sensory and

2057
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,840
accurate potentially to be reconciled

2058
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,480
and shown

2059
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,400
even a very simple case would that

2060
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,920
be a correct reason a bit i

2061
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,960
i think so i i think definitely that's

2062
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,400
um it's it's in large part right so that

2063
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,360
the idea that we're dealing with a

2064
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,000
stochastic

2065
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,320
system is kind of important because yes

2066
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,520
i want to claim that

2067
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,400
or i want to advance the suggestion the

2068
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,440
possibility that

2069
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,719
probabilities are encoded by

2070
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,560
probabilities so then you could have an

2071
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,600
actual identity

2072
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,280
whereas if you're just encoding like if

2073
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,800
you're using like

2074
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,400
i don't know the um

2075
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,840
a scheme that's more like what carl

2076
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,520
firsten talks about often where you

2077
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,880
have sort of neuronal states that are

2078
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,360
encoding the sufficient statistics of

2079
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,640
distribution

2080
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,080
then i don't think you could get an

2081
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,159
actual identity because you just you'd

2082
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,600
have a clear

2083
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,719
representation that has a certain

2084
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:37,600
um almost convention built in of how

2085
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,199
things are represented

2086
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,679
whereas i'm arguing for the possibility

2087
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,679
of a much more direct encoding

2088
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,040
and that does depend on this being

2089
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,719
stochastic but the other part of this

2090
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,840
that i forgot to mention

2091
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
that sort of i think maybe crystallizes

2092
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,960
the

2093
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,600
point this is trying to make is that um

2094
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,520
if if we're at equilibrium with respect

2095
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,120
to the network if we're at the

2096
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,960
um helmholtz machine's equilibrium

2097
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,480
distribution then

2098
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,239
um in that case if you do take rs

2099
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,679
describing the physical probabilities of

2100
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,719
the system

2101
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,000
that you would use to specify the

2102
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
thermodynamic properties uh

2103
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,080
then you could show that in that case at

2104
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,280
least the

2105
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,400
variational free energy and the

2106
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,000
thermodynamic free energy would be the

2107
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,760
same

2108
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,159
and then generalizing to non-equilibrium

2109
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,520
of course is the hard part

2110
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,760
but um that's that's that's more

2111
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,960
concretely what i was trying to show

2112
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,679
there

2113
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,280
um yeah thanks

2114
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,000
so i'm gonna go to a question from the

2115
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
chat and then we'll go to adam

2116
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,360
so cambridge breaths asks can this model

2117
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,080
describe or map the transition between

2118
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,280
focused attention

2119
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,760
and mind wandering grateful for any

2120
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,560
elaboration

2121
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,280
thanks everybody

2122
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,600
um anyone want to take that i

2123
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,960
i don't know i don't know yeah i don't

2124
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,520
know just

2125
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,440
maybe the dream versus the you know

2126
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,880
sleeping versus the waking

2127
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,199
but then even within the waking state we

2128
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,199
have a wandering phase versus a very

2129
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,080
tightly focused

2130
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,120
phase so there's sort of what is

2131
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:07,679
happening

2132
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,679
if that reminds you of anything i mean

2133
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:10,960
i'd say if we're talking about this

2134
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,440
model

2135
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,040
talking about the helmholtz machine or

2136
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,120
this like slight elaboration on the

2137
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,480
helmholtz machine then i don't

2138
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,760
think it would do anything that

2139
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,000
sophisticated just because

2140
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,320
like so as adam says there are

2141
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,760
biologically possible ways of

2142
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,440
implementing this kind of thing but like

2143
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,360
anything is fine-grained as a shift from

2144
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,800
attention to

2145
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,360
mind wandering i think is probably going

2146
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,239
to be left out of a model that's at this

2147
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:37,280
uh level of sort of abstraction and

2148
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,320
approximation that's my thought thanks

2149
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,880
so adam then blue and then anyone else

2150
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,400
with a raised hand or a question in the

2151
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:44,880
chat

2152
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,560
adam i'm not sure i can address the

2153
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,920
mind wandering exactly with

2154
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,840
psychophysical identity but in terms of

2155
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,320
like

2156
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,480
the mountain climbing analogy i'm

2157
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,000
wondering if it's like

2158
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,320
mind wandering is kind of like uh

2159
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,159
exploratory hill climbing with

2160
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,760
a little bit of quantum tunneling

2161
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,520
something like that but

2162
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,560
uh that's a that's a i mean what would

2163
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,840
you what you think actually it might

2164
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,040
loop around to the brain in an

2165
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,960
interesting sense um

2166
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,960
and that um there's

2167
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,480
like if we think of like

2168
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,480
lower levels of like a cortical

2169
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,400
hierarchy as doing something

2170
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,239
more like um a variational inference

2171
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,400
uh via like continuous message passing

2172
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,840
maybe with like some discrete updating

2173
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,960
there too

2174
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,520
um so

2175
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,000
that seems to be like one kind of

2176
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,880
implicit

2177
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,000
representational regime there might be

2178
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,920
a sense in which you're getting like

2179
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,360
probabilities in terms of like the

2180
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,719
attractor dynamics along this hierarchy

2181
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,239
corresponding to like

2182
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,920
probabilities of like a hierarchy of

2183
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,760
nested events in the world and like a

2184
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,360
deep temporal hierarchy

2185
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,159
and the deep temporal hierarchy of like

2186
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,239
the latent causes of the world

2187
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,560
uh but there seems to be like potential

2188
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,800
like as we like move inwards like

2189
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,840
another level where these get um

2190
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,640
re-represented into more like constant

2191
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,520
like when you're into like deep

2192
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,960
association cortex

2193
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,280
it might be a different game and then

2194
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,560
when you're getting like coupling with

2195
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:14,880
like

2196
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,640
the the campbell system uh now

2197
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,679
it seems like you're getting something

2198
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,239
almost like like explicit syntax

2199
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,120
with like discrete semantics because

2200
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,679
like

2201
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,920
you can map like there's these pointers

2202
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,719
going from like

2203
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,120
the relationship among these like you

2204
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,560
call like bump attractors

2205
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,320
the hippocampus system or like these

2206
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,040
place cells but they can be used to like

2207
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,400
contextualize the whole overall

2208
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,199
uh system within some sort of uh

2209
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,040
structured syntax

2210
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,800
um i'm i don't know like would

2211
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,239
do you need something like that to have

2212
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,320
the probabilities where for

2213
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,679
um is that what you're looking for or

2214
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,520
could there be more like this like

2215
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,400
inactive hierarchy of uh like a

2216
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,760
hierarchical boltzmann machine

2217
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,280
that has a nested and typical cause

2218
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,760
there and that those are probably like

2219
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,800
yeah both do it or would only like

2220
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,320
the re-representation yeah i don't know

2221
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,760
i think a lot about this this issue of

2222
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,800
re-representation

2223
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,360
and how much you know if it happens and

2224
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,199
what it's doing and stuff but um

2225
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,560
i think uh i guess i need to understand

2226
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,840
more

2227
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,280
and this is totally just my ignorance

2228
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,960
about the kind of

2229
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,840
models you're describing with

2230
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,239
hippocampus and such like um

2231
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,080
i tend to think of um

2232
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,719
i tend to think of of semantics in the

2233
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,560
brain just in terms of like vector space

2234
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,159
models um and so

2235
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,800
uh i'm just curious i don't know if we

2236
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,840
could talk about it now

2237
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,840
for a bit maybe i don't know it's up to

2238
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,440
daniel and others but like

2239
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,480
um what is the explicit syntax in this

2240
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,000
case it sounds something like something

2241
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,480
that i

2242
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,239
that would be friendly to to what i'm

2243
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,800
trying to do um so i guess like uh

2244
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,199
so this explicit syntax it's like still

2245
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,480
heavily researched there seems to be

2246
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,320
kind of like a gold rush

2247
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,199
among different like ai cop companies

2248
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,040
and like cognor labs of trying to figure

2249
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,600
out

2250
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,280
hippocampal system like deepmind this is

2251
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,960
kind of like what started them

2252
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,360
it was like kasabi's like making

2253
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,960
discoveries about this

2254
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,760
but the idea would be um that you have

2255
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,239
this

2256
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,199
graph structure that would be that

2257
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,880
originally would have evolved for just

2258
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,000
locations in like

2259
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,800
uh meat space or physical space yeah but

2260
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,400
then got repurposed for any kind of

2261
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,840
space and so this gives you like

2262
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,760
structured state spaces

2263
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,280
whether you're navigating through the

2264
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,760
world or you're navigating through like

2265
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,640
a spatial topology right this would

2266
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,400
basically the content

2267
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,600
would be these um and so it would be at

2268
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,239
the top

2269
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,040
of the cortical heterokey um and it

2270
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,560
would have pointers that could be

2271
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,440
unpacked

2272
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,360
in terms of like these more like modes

2273
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,640
of an active engagement

2274
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,840
there might be like another like

2275
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,520
intermediate level could be associated

2276
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,320
with consciousness

2277
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
where you're getting like um more

2278
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,440
concentrated

2279
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,679
attractor dynamics with like potentially

2280
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,239
a quasi-topographic relationship

2281
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,159
to events in the world and so the

2282
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,520
principles there

2283
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,520
um uh graph neural networks might be

2284
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,120
relevant there where basically you get

2285
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,080
this

2286
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,360
orders of magnitude greater

2287
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,360
representational efficiency

2288
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,360
by uh actually making the geometry

2289
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,679
of the system over which you're doing uh

2290
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,120
the deep learning

2291
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,760
resemble the thing that's being uh

2292
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,640
modeled so like

2293
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,120
um there's like graph grid neural

2294
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,239
networks that can be used for like

2295
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,360
spatial modeling

2296
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,960
or there's like graph mesh neural

2297
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,040
networks that can be used for like

2298
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,840
uh modeling of like someone's po like a

2299
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,000
a pose of a thing or an object

2300
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,520
and so in theory some things like this

2301
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,199
might form at the intermediate level

2302
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,400
and these might be the ones they're most

2303
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,560
heavily coupling with this hippocampus

2304
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,080
system which is giving you this

2305
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,199
syntax of state transitions

2306
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,000
right with like structured composition

2307
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,800
that's

2308
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,040
that's really cool can i comment on that

2309
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,960
for a minute yeah um alex go for it and

2310
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,159
then blue

2311
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,640
okay um yeah so there's a lot there

2312
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,159
that's that's exactly along the lines of

2313
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,280
what i've been thinking about this i've

2314
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,000
written a bit about

2315
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,360
these like conceptual sort of grid

2316
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,440
cell type things uh that it seems like

2317
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,400
there's a lot of evidence for that it's

2318
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,360
really awesome

2319
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,040
i know like memento is doing some

2320
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,040
research that's related to this stuff

2321
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,679
um so that's okay if that's what you

2322
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,199
mean then i'm totally on board like i

2323
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,239
wasn't sure if you meant that or

2324
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,520
something more language like

2325
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,560
with like discrete tokens with

2326
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,640
other parts but i mean that might be

2327
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,400
encompassed by this as well

2328
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,840
but it seems like uh people are finding

2329
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,120
also like encodings of like the

2330
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,920
hierarchical

2331
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,840
uh structure of like the grammar of

2332
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,239
language is also encoded

2333
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,560
uh it's found to have a correspondence

2334
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,159
uh right with like

2335
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,520
the structure of the like they said the

2336
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,520
relationships of these bump attractors

2337
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,719
that's amazing yeah i was going to

2338
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,560
mention also so you meant you gave all

2339
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,159
these examples of graph

2340
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,440
of neural networks that are sort of

2341
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,679
isomorphic with the domain that they're

2342
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,159
they represent um i was going to mention

2343
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,679
recursive neural networks used for

2344
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,120
language processing as well

2345
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,600
the the the network topology matches the

2346
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,639
syntax tree

2347
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,360
or something like that so i that's very

2348
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,280
that's very much along the lines of

2349
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,880
where this is going thanks alex so blue

2350
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,480
and then dean afterwards

2351
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,520
so i want to kind of loop back around to

2352
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,440
what adam said about dreaming because he

2353
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,040
totally like took the words out of my

2354
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,560
mouth but maybe um

2355
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,159
also touch on the question that was

2356
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,560
asked by the person in chat

2357
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,600
about mental wandering so

2358
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,760
is it possible so so alex your um

2359
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,679
you know objection to the dreaming and

2360
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,120
the physicality was

2361
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,840
that there's no evidence for top down

2362
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,960
control during the wake

2363
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,320
cycle is that correct is that what i

2364
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,560
heard you say um

2365
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,040
sorry no i actually meant to say kind of

2366
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,840
the opposite

2367
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,920
i meant to say that um that the problem

2368
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,880
with the weight with the helmholtz

2369
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,120
machine as a model is that it doesn't

2370
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,880
it doesn't model top-down effects

2371
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,120
during waking perception right and

2372
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,480
that's what i interpreted so

2373
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,239
so okay so if it doesn't if it doesn't

2374
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,560
model weak uh top-down effects during

2375
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,840
the wake cycle um is it possible that

2376
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,800
maybe

2377
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,159
there are like overlapping helmholtz

2378
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,080
functions happening right like so you

2379
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,600
know your mind wanders off or

2380
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,120
you're not paying attention and like

2381
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,639
maybe you're consolidating

2382
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,400
like you're you've got like one set

2383
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
sleeping one set waking and there's

2384
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,719
maybe like an overlapping construct of

2385
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:29,679
this like wake

2386
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,000
sleep learning cycle happening like

2387
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,880
while you're out

2388
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,800
mental wandering i'm consolidating you

2389
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,080
know the information from

2390
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,080
you know what i learned at breakfast or

2391
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,880
or something like that

2392
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,320
yeah yeah i mean i think there's i i

2393
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,199
think there are there

2394
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,239
are like like this model is adjacent to

2395
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,120
like many

2396
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,360
really interesting possible variations

2397
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,800
right and slight elaborations so like

2398
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,920
what you're talking about sounds to me

2399
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,040
like in that vein

2400
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,000
like i saw an amazing git repository of

2401
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,199
just like

2402
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,520
helmholtz machine variations right where

2403
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,719
they just they just tweak certain

2404
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,159
parameters like let's see what happens

2405
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:04,880
if we

2406
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,560
propagate a few steps down during the

2407
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,080
wake cycle as well you know things like

2408
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,719
that

2409
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,679
um so i think i don't know so i don't

2410
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,199
know if i fully grasp

2411
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,400
like exactly what you had in mind but it

2412
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,719
sounds pretty good

2413
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,040
and thanks for i mean you said go ahead

2414
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,639
oh alex go

2415
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,000
oh no i was gonna say thanks for also

2416
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,280
trying to address the comment and

2417
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,480
because i felt like i didn't

2418
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,280
wasn't able to answer it very well nice

2419
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,639
and there's definitely

2420
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,280
wandering in dreams and how is that

2421
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,480
different than the wake

2422
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,480
wandering and could that get at what the

2423
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,239
difference is between sleep and wake and

2424
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,520
could this model

2425
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,920
maybe give us a bit of a wedge to enter

2426
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,719
into that

2427
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,520
discussion so dean and then anyone else

2428
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,920
with a raised hand

2429
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,960
so alex back

2430
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,199
back to analogizing so i'm reading your

2431
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,280
paper and

2432
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,440
i can read something and i go oh my

2433
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,800
goodness look there's the world's

2434
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,000
biggest nickel

2435
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,159
and then i continue reading and then oh

2436
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,000
look there's the world's largest corn

2437
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,800
cob

2438
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,480
and then i have a chance to have a

2439
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,960
conversation with you and you're like

2440
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,239
saying to me well let's bring this back

2441
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,320
into some sort of

2442
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,719
proportionality so explain to me what is

2443
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,400
the

2444
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,719
2 carat deep diamond that you were

2445
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:19,679
trying to

2446
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,840
allow readers of your paper to get to

2447
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,360
because i know it's

2448
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,199
i know i blew it out of proportion

2449
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,199
because when i first read it

2450
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,159
it was a big deal but maybe you can help

2451
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,560
me bring it back into some sort of

2452
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,679
scale as to what what was your deep hope

2453
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,360
here yeah it's interesting

2454
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,120
no i mean i didn't i i don't i also

2455
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,639
don't mean to suggest that you got it

2456
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:43,040
wrong

2457
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,360
or anything with i think the proportion

2458
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,560
you're finding

2459
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,159
interpretations that are consistent with

2460
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:49,520
what i said you know it's not like it's

2461
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,480
not there

2462
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,920
but um and it's funny that if i'm trying

2463
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,159
to

2464
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,040
if it seems like i'm trying to put ad

2465
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:57,440
you know

2466
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,520
to put things in proportion or ground it

2467
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,639
in any way it's kind of funny because i

2468
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:01,360
feel like other

2469
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,360
others are trying to are trying to do

2470
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,800
that like

2471
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,120
you know relate this to embodiment and

2472
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,639
activism and things much more concrete

2473
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:09,120
and i

2474
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,719
i keep trying to keep it abstract but um

2475
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,760
but anyway the main

2476
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,679
i don't know what the hope was here i

2477
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:18,800
think

2478
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,120
um

2479
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,159
yeah i'm not sure i i think i think i

2480
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,920
just really wanted to point to the

2481
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,639
possib

2482
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,480
it was really about this identity thesis

2483
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,840
right which i'm not even sure that

2484
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,440
priyary i agree with by the way like i'm

2485
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,040
not sure that identity theory is the way

2486
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,639
to go in understanding the

2487
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,320
mind's relation to the brain i'm kind of

2488
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,480
like not really a reductionist

2489
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,159
but um i wanted to i it seemed like

2490
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,040
there was a possibility of of uh

2491
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,679
articulating a like

2492
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,520
quantitative version of that right

2493
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,440
using the tools that we've developed

2494
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,880
over the past several

2495
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,880
you know a couple decades that lewis

2496
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,239
didn't have access to

2497
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,639
um and i just really i i just love david

2498
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,000
lewis as a philosopher i think he had

2499
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,520
some amazing ideas and i

2500
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,560
i wanted to uh and it just seemed to

2501
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,159
it's not so much about that i wanted to

2502
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,760
to show anything in particular it just

2503
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,280
seemed to me that there was a

2504
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,199
natural convergence here that that could

2505
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,639
be spelled out

2506
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,639
so um that's kind of what i was trying

2507
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,400
to do

2508
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,719
thank you so steven with a raised hand

2509
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,080
and then anyone else

2510
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,000
who raises their hand and also in the

2511
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,520
last half hour or so

2512
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,280
anyone who wants to ask a question in

2513
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,199
the live chat so stephen then adam

2514
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,719
um i was just sort of tying in a bit

2515
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,880
with what

2516
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,480
was also said by adam uh around

2517
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,840
the the hippocampus so

2518
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,040
you've got the place cells in the

2519
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,440
hippocampus which gives the

2520
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,639
there's some way to bring the

2521
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,199
environment in potentially

2522
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,040
in this semantic i like i've not heard

2523
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,639
it thought about as semantics but a

2524
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,000
semantics of place

2525
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,639
if that makes sense so now we've got our

2526
01:25:58,639 --> 01:25:59,600
environment

2527
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,080
external states potentially being

2528
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:02,719
brought in

2529
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,239
in an attractive way you've got

2530
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:10,159
action states could be the grid cells

2531
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:13,280
with the whatness of what's out there

2532
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,520
and the sensory states is this lower

2533
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,360
level flux that's coming into the bottom

2534
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,280
of the brain

2535
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,520
and then the the generative model

2536
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,760
would be the the the higher level

2537
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,320
kind of well i'll be interested what the

2538
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,840
generative model is

2539
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,080
in all of that that if that makes sense

2540
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,320
if if we were to play in that

2541
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,760
in that sandpit it would it would give

2542
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,280
that way to bridge

2543
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,360
that i'm a big fan of the hippocampus

2544
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,719
but

2545
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,120
let's just uh but i i'd love to see how

2546
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,040
it all fits in with some of these pieces

2547
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,440
but

2548
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,239
i'm just curious around if that if that

2549
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,400
kind of

2550
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,040
uh role for these grid and place cells

2551
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,000
could be quite

2552
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,120
useful to to do this tractability

2553
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,239
between higher and

2554
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,520
lower level states here alex

2555
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,159
if you have any thoughts there otherwise

2556
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,159
i'll go to a question from the chat and

2557
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:10,560
then

2558
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,800
adam um yeah i mean i guess just really

2559
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,120
briefly it seems to me that if we if we

2560
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,080
are using these

2561
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,120
these place cells in in this sort of

2562
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,320
we've leveraged this thing that was

2563
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,199
originally meant for

2564
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,920
physical spatial navigation and we've

2565
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,440
transposed it to like

2566
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,199
conceptual spatial navigation

2567
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,800
essentially that's

2568
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
really cool i could see it being the

2569
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,159
sort of the thing that conditions

2570
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,639
expectations for the sensory motor stuff

2571
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,800
um and sort of it would just sort of

2572
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,400
define the generative model i guess the

2573
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,600
dynamics at that highest

2574
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,360
level would be the thing that sort of

2575
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,800
sets the

2576
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,040
the set points for things but i think

2577
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,280
adam might have more to say

2578
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,040
so just to the question which is also

2579
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,400
for adam says

2580
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,880
uh thanks adam did mention that the

2581
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,159
transition process

2582
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,719
probably involves quantum tunneling may

2583
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,320
i ask if he thinks

2584
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,040
the same for the transition from mind

2585
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:03,840
meandering

2586
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,560
back to focused attention so adam feel

2587
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,239
free to take up that question as well as

2588
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,600
anything else you'd like to add and then

2589
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,639
anyone can raise their hand

2590
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,000
oh boy um i mean i guess like

2591
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,719
um there's a sense in which like one of

2592
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,239
the quantum tunneling events

2593
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:22,960
i guess i would have in mind so like

2594
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,320
there'll be like these uh

2595
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,880
regimes of sense making where the

2596
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,639
hippocampal system will lay down

2597
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,719
a given tiling of the hippocampal system

2598
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,320
and collaboration the anterinal cortex

2599
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,440
of the grid cells will

2600
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,159
lay down this tiling of some domain

2601
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:37,040
within which

2602
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,120
you're doing this modeling with where

2603
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,480
that you can get basically

2604
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,239
the relationship among these bump

2605
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,000
attractors you can get this like

2606
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,400
structure the syntax and through the

2607
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,239
pointers the kind of synaptics

2608
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,719
uh and also with its themselves having a

2609
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,239
semantics of space maybe

2610
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:55,679
um just in the relation but the

2611
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,320
so i guess the quantum tunnel like so so

2612
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:58,880
but then

2613
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,400
if you get enough prediction error from

2614
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,159
the overall system this seems to trigger

2615
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,920
these resetting events

2616
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,920
where you'll break up the frame and then

2617
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,360
you'll do a new tiling and it's kind of

2618
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,960
like a re-grip

2619
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,719
on the active inference it's like a new

2620
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,000
kind of engagement

2621
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,639
a a new set of policies that could fit

2622
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,000
within this different

2623
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,520
uh conceptualization of the safe space

2624
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,639
you're working with

2625
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,280
and so um these events of remapping i

2626
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,480
guess you can maybe think of them as

2627
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,920
like the quantum tunneling

2628
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,159
it's like you're just you're not doing

2629
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,520
um

2630
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,120
i don't know if this works but it's like

2631
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,639
they're called like um

2632
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,400
some people come like levy flights like

2633
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,480
an animal is like foraging in a patch

2634
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,639
and then it's like and i'll just like

2635
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,400
jump to a greater patch once it's like

2636
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,520
not getting enough

2637
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,440
and so it'd be like you're kind of like

2638
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,880
imagining in this place

2639
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,800
and you're simulating this place and

2640
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,880
then you're like okay a little bit bored

2641
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,800
not quite the thing and then now you're

2642
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,840
imagining something else then you're

2643
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,800
imagining something else i guess you

2644
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,000
could think of those as like

2645
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
quantum tunneling like you're not just

2646
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,920
like working within one

2647
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,840
regime of simulation just fixing that

2648
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,520
thing you're moving from here to here to

2649
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,159
here

2650
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,080
but uh the question i had when i raised

2651
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,600
my hand was um

2652
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,000
so there's a sense in which you might

2653
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,719
think of like

2654
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,000
predictive coding style models of cortex

2655
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,199
i know it's like more complicated than

2656
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,040
predictive coding but there's a sense in

2657
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,360
which

2658
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,880
something like that is true probably

2659
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,600
true because

2660
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,440
if you do a primarily suppressive regime

2661
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,400
you end up inducing sparsity and if the

2662
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,199
events that

2663
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,000
are in the world are clocking slower

2664
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,600
than your internal updates

2665
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,159
you come out ahead in terms of like i

2666
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:35,360
mean that's why they did it for

2667
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,199
video coding it's just more efficient

2668
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,679
and so i'm wondering is is that enough

2669
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,760
to give like a psychophysical identity

2670
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,280
mapping um

2671
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,840
in terms of like there's a sense in

2672
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,400
which

2673
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,719
um you will minimize predictive coding

2674
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,320
mechanisms so they say we can

2675
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,360
go with just those um they should

2676
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,560
minimize

2677
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,960
uh they should minimize activity

2678
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,360
yeah um yeah that's that's actually kind

2679
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,960
of where i'm coming from

2680
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,040
with this paper um in a

2681
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,440
to a large extent i was thinking about

2682
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,239
yeah

2683
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,000
predictive coding as a way of

2684
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,080
understanding neural networks

2685
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,040
um so i think although this perspective

2686
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,760
can

2687
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,360
uh can encompass you know active

2688
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,960
inference and such i think

2689
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,679
that's sort of the core of it is that

2690
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:26,080
the

2691
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,320
brain is literally trying to yeah to um

2692
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,000
right sparsity as you said right induced

2693
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,600
varsity minimize

2694
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,600
activity only pass forward signals that

2695
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,880
need to be passed forward and that means

2696
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,639
that you're sort of quelling activity

2697
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,880
that doesn't get passed forward so i

2698
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,239
think i don't know if that's strong

2699
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:43,679
enough to get you an identity

2700
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,120
but i think it's uh it's consistent with

2701
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,120
the identity idea and it's um

2702
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,800
i think it's a large part of the

2703
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,679
inspiration for me

2704
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,000
awesome stephen with a raised hand and

2705
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,800
then anyone else

2706
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,679
yeah if you could just speak to how you

2707
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,080
see that predictive coding predictive

2708
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,000
processing

2709
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,560
be more or less useful at certain times

2710
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,360
um

2711
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:17,040
as the sort of the the the discourse

2712
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,239
and when maybe active inference is not

2713
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:23,120
as needed at certain times you know

2714
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,080
maybe

2715
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,800
thinking in applied context but um i'll

2716
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,600
just be curious

2717
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,239
yeah um it seems

2718
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,400
it seems to me that if you like that if

2719
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:40,880
you want a

2720
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,120
like the the the main advantage of

2721
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,719
active infants practically speaking to

2722
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:45,760
me seems to be

2723
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,960
like modeling uh

2724
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,800
like explicitly how how policies

2725
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,960
actions are chosen like decision making

2726
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,560
right based on

2727
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,719
um how you expect

2728
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,040
your actions to change the way states

2729
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:03,920
evolve

2730
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,239
so i think that that happens implicitly

2731
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,639
in a well-trained predictive coding

2732
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:09,840
architecture

2733
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,800
right i and i i see i don't see any

2734
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,639
fundamental theoretical advantage to

2735
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:15,840
active inference there in terms of

2736
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,120
explaining how things work

2737
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,400
on like a in principle level but

2738
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,880
that said it's really hard to like just

2739
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,239
train a recurrent neural network or

2740
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:24,960
whatever to

2741
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,239
to do what you want to do and then

2742
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,800
interpret its states and so on so if you

2743
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,960
have an idea of a generative model

2744
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,520
like of what the agent's generative

2745
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,880
model should look like

2746
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,239
then it makes much more sense to write

2747
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,080
it down a priori and

2748
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,320
you know try to build an active

2749
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,760
inference model

2750
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,239
than to just learn it from data um so

2751
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,320
that's as close to maybe a

2752
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,880
applied setting as i could get but i

2753
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,800
hope that sort of speaks to it

2754
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,360
yeah let me let me try to get another

2755
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,480
view on that from you

2756
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,560
alex where would you put active

2757
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,920
inference

2758
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,600
in relationship to supervised and

2759
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,280
unsupervised learning

2760
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,120
for those who might be less familiar

2761
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,320
with those topics

2762
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,679
when you're talking about learning from

2763
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,679
the data versus a generative model

2764
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,199
where does active inference fit into

2765
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,920
that yeah that's a great question

2766
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,000
um it's it's a bit

2767
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,360
it's a bit tricky because there's this

2768
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,719
issue of preference learning that's kind

2769
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,159
of not settled

2770
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:23,280
in the you know like as far as uh how

2771
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,719
how much of the future of of real

2772
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,239
uh biological agents uh learning do we

2773
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,360
think that is

2774
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,040
but like um so to me the most natural

2775
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,239
way of thinking of

2776
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,400
of unsupervised learning happening in

2777
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,840
active infants is that you've got sort

2778
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:40,880
of a

2779
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,000
um you've got a phenotype right some

2780
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,280
some aspects of which are going to be

2781
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,320
immutable over

2782
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,639
relevant time scales but some aspects of

2783
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:49,520
which will change

2784
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,719
right so we're talking about synaptic

2785
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,719
weights you could think of that as

2786
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,560
an extended part of your phenotype and

2787
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,239
that will change over

2788
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:57,679
you know time scales of perceptual

2789
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:00,960
learning and and during the life

2790
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,520
organism's lifetime and such so like um

2791
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:09,199
that that is i think is neatly

2792
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,400
you can categorize that as a form of

2793
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,560
unsupervised learning um

2794
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,000
but that's also not really

2795
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,639
uh again it's not it's not there are

2796
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:19,360
people who

2797
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,199
are active in sort of practitioners who

2798
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,560
don't really

2799
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,960
uh think that preference learning is a

2800
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,840
thing that happens or

2801
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,280
um yeah it's not clear

2802
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,760
what role it plays um but but but

2803
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,040
overall i mean

2804
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,960
uh well there's also there's also gotta

2805
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,400
be a role for um

2806
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,320
something like uh supervised learning

2807
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,360
seems to me the closest thing

2808
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,159
that we have to that in real systems is

2809
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,360
is like

2810
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:55,119
uh reinforcement in a way so like

2811
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,520
uh and that's certainly gotta play a

2812
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,639
role that's complementary to

2813
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,480
unsupervised learning but i think

2814
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,718
um

2815
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,520
i don't know this this answer is kind of

2816
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,679
[ __ ] i'm sorry uh

2817
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,040
it's uh i'm happy to to

2818
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,880
to take it up more i'm just not sure

2819
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,800
what like i don't know how to

2820
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,119
how to how to tease apart the you know

2821
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,360
the the parts of active inference that

2822
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,400
should be understood in terms of

2823
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,040
unsupervised learning versus just like

2824
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,639
learning in general and how much of it i

2825
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,480
i suspect a lot of learning in general

2826
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:28,800
has

2827
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,760
got to be unsupervised and i think

2828
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,440
active inference

2829
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,719
is sort of uh

2830
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,040
naturally interpreted it's predictive

2831
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,400
coding certainly is is

2832
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,199
is an unsupervised learning paradigm and

2833
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:44,480
to the extent that active influence

2834
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,360
reduces to that

2835
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,800
it is too great thank you

2836
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,480
and these are definitely all topics

2837
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,159
we're always trying to

2838
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,840
think clearer about and communicate

2839
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,920
clearer about so stephen

2840
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,719
and then adam

2841
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,880
i think this is a useful conversation i

2842
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,719
know it's a bit off it's pretty on the

2843
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,159
spot a little bit but i think as a group

2844
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,679
it's quite useful

2845
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,199
this question of um when a generative

2846
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,960
model comes into play

2847
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,800
so with reinforcement learning i suppose

2848
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,480
there's a generative model

2849
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,119
in relation to like an induction an

2850
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,520
inductive reasoning in terms of the goal

2851
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,719
like you're trying to narrow the gap

2852
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:24,800
between the target that you're

2853
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,560
reinforcing the reward

2854
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,960
and reducing the gap whereas there's

2855
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,520
this abductive potential

2856
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,560
in active inference to

2857
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,840
and i wonder whether in the in the

2858
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,960
population

2859
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,119
or the population of the brain's

2860
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,040
attention

2861
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,600
i'm sort of wondering if place cells and

2862
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,320
the sort of more granular parts of the

2863
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,719
lower levels of the neocortex or i'm not

2864
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:51,920
sure if that's the right

2865
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,400
term are basically that kind of

2866
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,440
um more

2867
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,360
unsupervised very unsupervised very

2868
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,520
abductive kind of potentially

2869
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,440
ways of engaging and then these grid

2870
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,239
cells as they get more populated with

2871
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:09,840
what things are

2872
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:15,360
become kind of more top down maybe more

2873
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,360
let us go back into say a more

2874
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,199
reinforcement learning or supervised

2875
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,480
learning because like

2876
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,880
and then you you don't forage as much so

2877
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,159
to speak you uh

2878
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,239
you just go straight to the point which

2879
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,440
probably i should do now

2880
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:31,839
and let someone else

2881
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,040
thanks steven um alex if you want to add

2882
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,840
something otherwise we'll go to adam

2883
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,199
um yeah no just to say i mean that kind

2884
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:42,480
of makes sense to me i think

2885
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,719
i think you you need i think you need

2886
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,159
unsupervised learning for

2887
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,920
representation learning of whatever

2888
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,440
isn't innate

2889
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,199
right and then once you have that

2890
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,560
framework then

2891
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,840
then you can start to think about like

2892
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
reward like meaningful

2893
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,440
you know interpretations of sensory

2894
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,560
stimuli that you could associate with

2895
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,000
rewards so

2896
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,159
that's all saved for now cool adam

2897
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,800
um a quick uh com a question but a quick

2898
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,320
comment on what stephen said um

2899
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,639
i mean interestingly about hippocampal

2900
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,480
system is there does seem to be like

2901
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,119
this [ __ ]

2902
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:18,560
like very contrastive thing to it um

2903
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,960
in terms of like comparing between

2904
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,400
current states and then

2905
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,639
imagine states and like at different

2906
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,000
like duty cycles of

2907
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,480
theta you'll be seeing there seems to be

2908
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,159
this comparison operation going on so it

2909
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,679
could be very much like this

2910
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,400
higher level highest level supervisor in

2911
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,280
this like

2912
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,520
uh matroyshka dolls of like

2913
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,639
quasi-homuncular

2914
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,760
things that we're thinking of um but um

2915
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,560
the the question i i was wondering wait

2916
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,520
there's people who don't believe

2917
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,760
preference learning is a thing

2918
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,360
oh i shouldn't i shouldn't have put

2919
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,119
anyone on the spot it's not that

2920
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,480
it's necessary they don't believe it's a

2921
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,400
thing it's that it's not clear that we

2922
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,000
need to invoke it to explain

2923
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,119
behavior behavioral things in at least

2924
01:39:59,119 --> 01:39:59,440
in

2925
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,880
in many cases um so i feel like i'm

2926
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:03,360
gonna

2927
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,679
i'm gonna be speaking for for people who

2928
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,199
are colleagues of mine who i don't wanna

2929
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,560
i don't wanna misrepresent their views

2930
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,239
so i'll shut up about it but

2931
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,480
there's definitely controversy about the

2932
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,960
extent of which it happens i suppose

2933
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,360
i mean i i'm wondering i guess like to

2934
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,520
what ex like

2935
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,000
so like there's things like uh like

2936
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,960
metal learning

2937
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,040
uh principles where like you have like

2938
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,560
you're figuring out like new ways of

2939
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,719
approaching policies so you're like

2940
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,480
of realizing goals and you're building

2941
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,000
up these like

2942
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,080
policies like an exploratory fashion as

2943
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,159
part of your phenotypic plasticity

2944
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:41,440
and um but i guess there is a sense in

2945
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,480
which like

2946
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,800
if we're like for subscribing to the

2947
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,480
free energy principle

2948
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,639
you can only prefer one thing and that

2949
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,000
thing never changes and everything

2950
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
else is just instrumental it just you

2951
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,199
could just only prefer

2952
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,520
to be basically agent smith for the

2953
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,880
entire world

2954
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,000
you could like my pattern me me me

2955
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,199
um right but you know ultimately

2956
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:06,000
this should be like we in terms of like

2957
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,239
the

2958
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,719
evolutionary favorable equilibria but it

2959
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:09,920
seems like

2960
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,679
i guess there is a sense in which that

2961
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:13,280
never changes

2962
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,320
yeah i mean i just

2963
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,119
so i say one thing to like to try to

2964
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:19,600
make

2965
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,040
defend the people that i i've been

2966
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,520
talking about um but i say preference

2967
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,440
is controversy about preference learning

2968
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,679
i mean there's clearly something that

2969
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:28,880
that looks like preference learning

2970
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,080
right it's just a question of whether

2971
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,280
you're really learning preferences or

2972
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,320
you're just learning

2973
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,880
new associations with with the things

2974
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:35,840
that you prefer

2975
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,239
and the complete those two processes are

2976
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:39,600
conceptually distinct they might lead to

2977
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,560
similar

2978
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,040
results but uh yeah but the point you're

2979
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,400
raising is interesting that is that

2980
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,719
really your preference is like you right

2981
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,520
literally

2982
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,920
your phenotype so well yeah i have a

2983
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,119
question for you

2984
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,199
yeah that's exactly where i was going to

2985
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,679
go could there not be a cultural

2986
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,000
scaffolding that's developed over

2987
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,960
ecological

2988
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,040
and evolutionary time that values

2989
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,639
diversity of perspective

2990
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,800
and so yes it is true that at different

2991
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,800
scales some type of active inference

2992
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,080
could be happening but

2993
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,760
i don't think that agent smith would be

2994
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,600
the only attractor at the bottom of that

2995
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,239
bull

2996
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,400
it'd be more like a uh maybe a plate

2997
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,760
with a lot of different wells a lot of

2998
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,239
different

2999
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,400
kinds of food that could be converged

3000
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,600
upon

3001
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,520
why would it have to be converging on

3002
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,960
one specific

3003
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,760
um especially hollywood represented

3004
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,320
version

3005
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,840
of what efficiency is

3006
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,880
just a thought but yeah i don't think

3007
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,320
agent smith would win

3008
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,600
like villains usually lose

3009
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,360
you know steven

3010
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,040
well this this could be though when you

3011
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,639
get into that non-equilibrium

3012
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,800
equilibrium dynamic is like

3013
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,000
once you get a dictator who establishes

3014
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,960
an equilibrium

3015
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,760
that's an energy equilibrium which is

3016
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,520
that's going to be more powerful than

3017
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,119
the more subtle

3018
01:42:57,119 --> 01:43:00,639
organic non-equilibrium states it just

3019
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,960
dominates at times and if there is made

3020
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,080
in equivalence

3021
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,880
in some near or distant future between

3022
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,800
actual energy usage

3023
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,360
and governance for example some sort of

3024
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,239
crypto

3025
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,800
system with energy and voting and

3026
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:17,840
information

3027
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,320
and finances all being mixed together

3028
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,119
it'll be a

3029
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:24,159
enormous nexus of power and maybe we'll

3030
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,840
be able to use these kinds of frameworks

3031
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,960
to

3032
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,480
describe them stephen

3033
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,360
and also going the other way then if you

3034
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,199
this is my belief this is

3035
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:38,239
without is i i strongly believe that to

3036
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,320
create

3037
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,040
community engagement in meaningful ways

3038
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,239
you have to create

3039
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:48,080
the the container um

3040
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,520
for those more subtle non-equilibrium

3041
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,800
states to have

3042
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,080
a chance to breathe um this this woman

3043
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,080
ariane munchkin she's a she's a theater

3044
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:58,800
director in

3045
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,880
france she talks about don't crush the

3046
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:01,920
butterfly

3047
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,840
she will tell the actors don't crush the

3048
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,360
butterfly the butterfly is like

3049
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,600
the idea so don't grab hold of it

3050
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,800
because you'll crush it

3051
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,880
so it's quite a nice metaphor you have

3052
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,159
to hold it lightly

3053
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,639
and allow it to and there's there's a

3054
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,320
certain

3055
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,800
because equilibrium dynamics or someone

3056
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,080
who comes in and basically starts

3057
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,360
shouting at people

3058
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:24,239
will always over dominate someone who's

3059
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:24,800
trying to do

3060
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,600
some let's all come together and find

3061
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,119
each other's plurality

3062
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:32,080
so anyway that's that sort of dynamic

3063
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,400
sort of ties in with what you're saying

3064
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,000
cool so i flipped to 49 where we have

3065
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,880
our usual

3066
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,119
set of just closing discussions so in

3067
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,159
these last

3068
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:46,239
10 minutes we'll just be remarking on

3069
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:47,679
what we thought was interesting or

3070
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,679
important from the conversation

3071
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,840
what would we like to pursue next in

3072
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:52,800
terms of our own

3073
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,679
work or alex in terms of your research

3074
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,040
i'm sure we're also

3075
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,520
all curious as well about how you apply

3076
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,880
these ideas

3077
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,080
in terms of your you know whatever

3078
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,239
non-proprietary

3079
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:07,440
applications you think that this bears

3080
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:07,760
on

3081
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,000
if none then that's its own interesting

3082
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,760
claim or maybe there is something that

3083
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,639
this helps us

3084
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,679
do in terms of practice um

3085
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,080
what are the next steps here maybe alex

3086
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,520
first and then anyone else can give a

3087
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,520
thought

3088
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,760
uh sure so i mean i could address these

3089
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,119
questions on the slide or

3090
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,880
yeah let's let's yeah let's hear your

3091
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,320
question your answers to these questions

3092
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,520
on the slide

3093
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,360
so i mean this also speaks to what you

3094
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,119
just asked but i think

3095
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,639
really i think that this is just a way

3096
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,280
of thinking about things um

3097
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,280
that the main thing i think it enables

3098
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,199
is just allowing you to in to infer

3099
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,920
from what you know about cognition or

3100
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,920
the cognitive states of some system

3101
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,199
including yourself

3102
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,520
to physical states right if it's true

3103
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,239
then

3104
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,000
then for example yeah you can say well

3105
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,400
i'm depressed there's not a lot going on

3106
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,639
um you know i'm i'm uh i'm ruminating a

3107
01:45:58,639 --> 01:45:59,040
lot

3108
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,199
uh you can infer that there's something

3109
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,639
physically happening

3110
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,840
that's mirrors that process and

3111
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,760
you can take either a physical or a

3112
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,880
psychological

3113
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,639
approach to solving any in your body

3114
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:13,600
right in theory

3115
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,040
now there's a lot of working out to be

3116
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,360
done of how that would work in specific

3117
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,280
cases but that's the kind of

3118
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,199
like basically just sort of smoothing

3119
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,520
the path for inference from physical to

3120
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,639
psychological states

3121
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,719
i think is uh is the main thing that i

3122
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,320
think is is practical about the

3123
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,800
practically important about this

3124
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,880
um and i'm still curious about how to

3125
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,000
spell that out

3126
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,199
um for specific types of states

3127
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,000
uh like like depression desires things

3128
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,880
like that

3129
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,719
and um i'm also curious about whether

3130
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,239
any of it is true at all or whether it's

3131
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:47,280
just complete nonsense

3132
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:50,239
big questions adam and then anyone else

3133
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,040
who wants to give

3134
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,880
any thought or address one of the

3135
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,440
questions on the slide

3136
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,800
if there's complete nonsense i'm not

3137
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,639
sure what would make sense i'm not even

3138
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,400
sure that what the sense would mean um

3139
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,480
yeah uh later i would really want to

3140
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,920
talk to you about like

3141
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,639
the degrees of freedom and like volition

3142
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:07,440
issue

3143
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,800
and and like different ways that could

3144
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,880
play out and also i want to drag you

3145
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,880
into consciousness because

3146
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,719
you you are precise my friend and you're

3147
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,080
helping me think better

3148
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,920
so cool thanks adam

3149
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,280
happy too cool um

3150
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,360
if anyone else has a thought otherwise

3151
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,199
we can sort of

3152
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:30,799
look back oh yeah steven go for it

3153
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,920
yeah i just will say thank you for

3154
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:34,560
bringing

3155
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,280
the sort of this foundational build-up

3156
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:37,679
in

3157
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,159
into the um thermodynamics and i'd be

3158
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,280
interested to

3159
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,600
yeah maybe sort of see if there's any i

3160
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,080
i did physical chemistry um

3161
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,199
as um so i've got some background but i

3162
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:50,159
i i'm

3163
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:53,040
curious to see if there's any ways to um

3164
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,560
bring in some elements of

3165
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,320
of sort of gibbs free energy and

3166
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,280
uh into some of this so i'll be glad to

3167
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,880
chat about that at some time

3168
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:07,440
yeah blue

3169
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,159
so when you guys are done talking about

3170
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,360
degrees of freedom and

3171
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,280
agency you have to come back to the chat

3172
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,719
because i want to hear all about this i

3173
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:15,440
have

3174
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,880
some thoughts that have been cooking

3175
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,199
about agency related to active inference

3176
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:19,520
and

3177
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,639
other ideas also cool and

3178
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,280
maybe dean i'd like to ask where does

3179
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,400
the dot two

3180
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,239
get us what do we do at the end of the

3181
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:29,840
dot two we took that step

3182
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,480
to the dot zero with yourself and blue

3183
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,119
and i

3184
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,880
and then we take the dot one and dot two

3185
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,199
steps ideally with the author

3186
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,520
especially when it's an awesome author

3187
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,040
like alex who's engaged with the

3188
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:41,840
material

3189
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,639
before the dot one and between the two

3190
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:45,760
what's our next step

3191
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,760
you know on that staircase what do we do

3192
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,280
after the dot two how do we make the

3193
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,000
best

3194
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,040
of this well

3195
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,159
this is a sample of one so but for me

3196
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:58,719
it's uh

3197
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,600
so how do you remain stable and dynamic

3198
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,800
at the same time

3199
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,440
how do you move through these gradients

3200
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,600
whether it's ascending or descending

3201
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,920
and also keep in in the front of your

3202
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,639
mind

3203
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,800
how you're going to keep your grip if

3204
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,320
you're ascending or

3205
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,679
maintain your balance when you're

3206
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,760
descending and for me

3207
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,280
that's what alex's paper essentially

3208
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,199
pointed out there is a there's a

3209
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,639
physical piece to that

3210
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,800
and there's a statistical piece to that

3211
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,560
and i don't want to become a statistic

3212
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,440
of another

3213
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,480
old person who falls down the stairs so

3214
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,560
how do i pull all of that together and

3215
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,840
have it make sense

3216
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,480
especially if i don't want to give

3217
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,840
somebody

3218
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,040
a training exercise if i want them to be

3219
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,400
able to model

3220
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,119
how to get down that descent or up that

3221
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:47,840
ascent

3222
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,199
and i can't give them a map so what do i

3223
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:53,679
what do i give them what do i replace

3224
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:54,800
that with

3225
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,960
that's what alex's paper gave to me gave

3226
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,520
me a little bit of confidence

3227
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,960
awesome one more staircase thought

3228
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,599
and coming back as well to the up and

3229
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,719
down hill

3230
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,080
so when you're going up the staircase

3231
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,320
you'd grab onto a certain spot on the

3232
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,080
rail and then that helps you

3233
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,400
ratchet up and then when you're going

3234
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,440
down the staircase

3235
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,679
you're unlikely to grab on tight to a

3236
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,760
rail you kind of want to loosely have

3237
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,400
your hand

3238
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,159
sliding down the rails so that you can

3239
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,840
ratchet if you needed to

3240
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,239
and stabilize but if you ratchet while

3241
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,440
you're going down

3242
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,520
then it's gonna prevent you from

3243
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,440
continuing this sort of natural

3244
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,159
descent so it just makes me think about

3245
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,599
different modes in understanding

3246
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:38,080
especially

3247
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,520
because as we talked about with the

3248
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,360
mountain climber it's like going up and

3249
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,159
down hill

3250
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,719
in their own way if the top is your goal

3251
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:46,719
they're like both going downhill

3252
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:50,639
so when in our process do we want to

3253
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:53,199
grip the rail lightly just like steven

3254
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,119
said not crush the butterfly

3255
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:57,199
just slide along and just go with the

3256
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,199
flow knowing that we can

3257
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:01,760
stabilize when we need to and when do we

3258
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,239
really

3259
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,040
want to grip and ratchet because we're

3260
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,000
working against

3261
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,080
one energy gradient but we're working

3262
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,840
towards our goals when we do that

3263
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,960
so i hope all these mixed metaphors come

3264
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,520
together

3265
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,599
for the listeners in an enjoyable way

3266
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,560
and alex

3267
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,719
we really appreciate your engagement

3268
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,800
with actinflab here and everybody else

3269
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,639
awesome conversations yeah thanks thanks

3270
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:28,320
uh blue dean daniel steven adam uh

3271
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,239
people who were here last week also um

3272
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,560
i'm i'm happy to be put on the spot

3273
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,320
i'm glad this was of service to people i

3274
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,679
think it's been a really interesting

3275
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:36,400
discussion

3276
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,560
and um thanks for thanks for having me

3277
