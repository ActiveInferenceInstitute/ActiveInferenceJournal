00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
hello everyone welcome to the active

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
inference lab live stream number 29.1

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
today is september 21st 2021 and we are

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
going to be discussing this paper active

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,679
inference and active inference framework

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,600
for ant colony behavior

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
this is a recorded and an archived live

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
stream so please provide us with

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,559
feedback so we can improve our work we

11
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,039
are a participatory online lab that is

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
communicating learning and practicing

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
applied active inference you can find us

participate in a panel

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
today our goal is to learn and discuss

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
this paper active inference an active

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
inference framework for ant colony

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
behavior

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
uh we will be maybe going through some

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
of the aims and claims keywords figures

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
uh and

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
having a discussion around this paper

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,479
so just to start off we will

34
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
go around and introduce ourselves and

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
then start off with some warm-up

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
questions so my name is blue knight i am

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
an independent research consultant from

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,640
new mexico and i will pass it to marco

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
so hi

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
my name is marco i'm located in vienna

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
austria i'm a postdoctoral fellow at the

42
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
conrad lawrence institute for commission

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
research

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
and my interest is very much from the

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
clinical perspective i have to do with

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
dbs patients and i have come across

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,760
active inference actually rather

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,239
recently

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
cool daniel

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
thanks um i'm daniel i'm in california

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
and

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
as

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
first author i'm happy to maybe just

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,599
introduce the

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
big picture

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
um you wanna just briefly say hello and

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,160
then i'll return

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
stephen are you

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
here steven

60
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
yeah hi there

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
so did you just introduce me hi stephen

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
here um nice to be on and uh

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
i am based in toronto and um

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
i work

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
with communities and work with spatial

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
sense making

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
around different issues and um how

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
active inference can now

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,280
help to understand

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
those processes of sense making

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
and

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
dynamic inference in in the modern world

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
awesome so daniel do you want to maybe

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,080
introduce the paper or give us a summary

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
of what was your big takeaway message uh

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
from this paper or what was your

77
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
motivation behind the work

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
well just

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
hearing some of the backgrounds of those

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
here ranging from human medical and

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,599
clinical to sort of social and

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,959
collective processes playing out in

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,080
humans

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,000
it just shows that we each approach

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,480
active inference from our own experience

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,360
so

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
personally my background was in genetics

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
and insect behavioral ecology

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
and so it was conversations and reading

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
the papers

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,959
of especially axel and of course carl

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,159
fristen

93
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,040
and we were having conversations about

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
where does active inference fit into

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
discussions about collective

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
intelligence where does active inference

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
fit into bigger discussions about

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
evolutionary theory like if active

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
inference can be an integrative

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,478
framework

101
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
for different social systems for

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
different human systems

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,720
why not other animals too

104
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
and uh so there we were at the

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,800
intersection of

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
curious about big questions in

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
evolutionary theory which i know we'll

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
return to today and specific questions

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
about the areas that i was researching

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
at the time

111
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
which was the regulation of foraging and

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,720
decision making in ants and so it was

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,759
conversations with with axel and maxwell

114
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,199
to a large extent where we started

115
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,479
thinking

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,840
how could we modify the types of models

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
that we currently have in active

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
inference and bring that into something

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
that adequately at least starts to work

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,759
towards

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
capturing how the ants do it and alec

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,520
had worked on the code of many active

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
inference projects and so that was quite

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
a fun process maybe we can also talk

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
about like interfacing between ants and

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
computer science

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,880
and

128
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
we mainly wanted to

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
navigate a little bit towards the bigger

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,639
questions in biology but do so by really

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
tackling a specific scenario that would

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,560
then lend itself to unique explanations

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
and predictions and models

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
and the specific contribution that

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
differentiates the active inference

136
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,560
model from other active inference models

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
is first that it's in insects and ants

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,320
but also importantly that it's stigmatic

139
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
so it's modeling explicitly the feedback

140
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
between the environments

141
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
and the agents whereas there had been

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,759
sort of multi-agent active inference

143
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,960
simulations

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
where the agents communicated with each

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
other or they had a shared theory of

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,160
mind

147
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
those types of models existed but this

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
was the first time that one of the

149
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,880
action affordances of the agents

150
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
included the capacity to modify the

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
environment and the status of the

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
environment modified the likelihood of

153
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
the agent taking different kinds of

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,720
actions

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
cool so i just want to reach out to um

156
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,520
marco and steven and just ask like

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
what's something that you were excited

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
to talk about today or something that

159
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
you liked or remembered about the paper

160
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,240
either you have thoughts

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
should i start

162
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
so one thing as i already mentioned

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,120
before is the role of dopamine which i

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
find super interesting

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
and you mentioned the paper that the

166
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,720
foragers have higher levels of

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
dopamine so i was wondering about the

168
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
role of that

169
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,759
and how that

170
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,599
influences

171
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,560
affordances and what the individual and

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
also the level above like the the colony

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
does with that so is there a specific

174
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,160
role for dopamine

175
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
for the for the colony as a whole

176
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
great question and we wrote it down on

177
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
slide 14 so we'll definitely return to

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
talking about some of the molecular

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,400
roles of dopamine

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
cool and stephen do you have any

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,639
thoughts

182
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,160
yeah i suppose mine's a bit more of a

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,840
broad question but i'll be really

184
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,120
curious about that balance between sort

185
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
of specific

186
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,000
um things relating to ants and how that

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
relates to things like dopamine and

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,560
maybe the broader process of like the

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
design thinking and working through this

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
kind of active inference framework just

191
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
how that was useful

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,639
to think about

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
how things may relate to their

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
environment

195
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
so i suppose the process of creating the

196
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
model as well as what the model was and

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
what it found out about things in the

198
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
world thanks

199
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
awesome daniel

200
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,199
it's a great point um almost asking

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,639
about how do we study the biomimicry not

202
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
of just materials like light materials

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
or strong materials but of collective

204
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
algorithms

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
and we can't really study

206
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
the success or the attributes of a

207
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,160
collective behavioral algorithm outside

208
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
of its ecological niche

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
and so

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
a very long and important branch of

211
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,319
research by my phd advisor professor

212
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
deborah gordon which is where i was when

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,559
we were doing a lot of this initial work

214
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,200
she studied for 30 plus years

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
understanding how the statistical

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
regularities of the niche

217
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,958
were then

218
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,399
associated with which collective

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
behavioral algorithms of ants

220
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
we saw happening

221
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
and so there's like 15 000 ant species

222
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
there on every piece of land except for

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,560
basically antarctica which is kind of

224
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,000
where they should be if you think about

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
it but

226
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
if you want to have a framework for ant

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
behavior that includes the desert and

228
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
the jungle and all these types of

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
different environments it sort of baked

230
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
in

231
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
this idea of appropriate generalization

232
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
because like we definitely can't have a

233
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,000
theory for each ant species so we need

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
to look a little bit bigger than that

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,560
yet we don't want to have just an aunt

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
specific theory only and let's you know

237
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
think about termites and bees and

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
non-insects so what is the appropriate

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
level of generalization and how are we

240
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
going to generalize the study of

241
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
collective behavioral algorithms and how

242
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
they interface with different kinds of

243
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,959
environments

244
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,880
while also remembering that you know we

245
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
got to have our eyes on the ground we

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,640
need to be explaining those ants we

247
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
can't just simply spiral off into the

248
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
abstractions about collective behavior

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
so they answer a cool system because

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
they remind us about ecological and

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
behavioral diversity and the need to

252
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
generalize but also there is a real

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
system that we can actually see

254
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
awesome thanks

255
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
steven

256
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
yeah thanks daniel i was wondering how

257
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
much um that generalizability that is in

258
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
the field that you're in with your

259
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
supervisor you know that might be

260
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
something that really brings something

261
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
to the table for active inference and

262
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
i'll be curious as well

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
you know how much those algorithms that

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,519
have been worked on for a number of

265
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,560
years

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
either got modified or ported or had to

267
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,079
be kind of reconceptualized from the

268
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,160
ground up you know

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,480
that'd be interesting

270
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,680
cool daniel you have a response

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
yep so one reason why active inference

272
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
is able to swap in to where other

273
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,760
theories or frameworks have been used

274
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
before is because at the core it's an

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
input output structure just like a lot

276
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
of other behavioral studies like sensory

277
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
information comes in

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
something happens

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
and then action comes out so in that way

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,399
it's able to map onto a lot of other

281
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,880
ways that people have thought about

282
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
animal behavior or ethology

283
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
one of the differences in active

284
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
inference is that we're not committed to

285
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
any specific cognitive model so like in

286
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
this paper we just used pretty much the

287
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,160
most simple possible cognitive model if

288
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
you could even call it that it was one

289
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,880
step decision making there was no memory

290
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
there was no anticipation there was no

291
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
capacity to use some of the sensory

292
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
affordances that we know that ants

293
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,560
actually have and use in nature like

294
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
multiple sense interactions with nest

295
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
mates interactions with other physical

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
objects so we mapped onto this input

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
output structure

298
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
but we know that we can generalize it

299
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,399
later but so that's one reason why

300
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
active inference will um hopefully play

301
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
a nice generalizing role there

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
um

303
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
i i hope yeah go ahead stephen yeah

304
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
that's really cool and i suppose one

305
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
thing that when you mention that i

306
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
suppose this even ties in with that

307
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
dopamine question but i'm not sure

308
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
because i'm not as familiar with that

309
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
but

310
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
is by not having it all based on the

311
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,279
cognitive it's showing what the niche

312
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
can do for you in a way it's like how

313
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
much

314
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,680
you know we all assume it's all going on

315
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,959
in the head which is the old way of

316
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,480
thinking but

317
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
with the active influence it's like well

318
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
maybe there's other ways that we can get

319
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,240
where we need to get so to speak

320
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
awesome

321
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
and with the ants it was almost never a

322
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
question of it happening inside the head

323
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
only because it's it's not to demean

324
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
their cognition it's just very clear

325
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
that no single forager would know how

326
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
many seeds does the colony have how many

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
does it need through time what's the

328
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
weather and the trade-offs of foraging

329
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
where are the seeds i mean those are

330
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
questions that at a first pass we know

331
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,360
are just unknowable and so

332
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
it's pretty clear that the way that

333
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
individual nest mates are making

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
decisions

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,920
has to have

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
a radically different mode

337
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
than for example let's wait till we have

338
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
all the information and then make the

339
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
well-ration decision based on our

340
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
simulation it's just not happening and

341
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
then once you see that lens on ants you

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,920
go

343
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,720
huh well maybe there's some other

344
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,600
forming settings where the agents don't

345
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
have total information and even if they

346
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,399
did it wouldn't be obvious what to do

347
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,079
like we can all imagine a chess board we

348
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,360
have total information about where the

349
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,399
pieces are but even experts in chess

350
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
don't necessarily know the best move and

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
there might not even be necessarily one

352
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
perfect best move

353
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,240
so it really moves us into a setting of

354
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
thinking about how action is undertaken

355
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
including action that can be epistemic

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
like gaining knowledge amidst

357
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
uncertainty

358
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
rather than waiting until we've resolved

359
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
our uncertainty because then what we

360
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,079
still wouldn't know what to do

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
cool that leads in pretty nicely to one

362
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
of the questions that i had brought up

363
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
last week so there are these colony

364
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
level metrics right like how many seeds

365
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,600
are

366
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
in the nest or how many you know uh

367
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
nurse nurse maids are there relative to

368
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
infants or foragers relative to you know

369
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
a baby yeah i guess

370
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,320
so how are these colony level metrics

371
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
retained in a colony

372
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
good

373
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,839
question well

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,600
you asked a why

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
question in a sense so it makes me think

376
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,760
about the tin bergens four wise which

377
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
we've spoken about um on other live

378
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
streams but the evolutionary

379
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,120
um why is just colonies that have

380
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
certain colony level attributes are more

381
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
likely to succeed and so we end up

382
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,199
seeing

383
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,600
the emergence of certain

384
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
ratios of male to female nest mates or

385
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
certain ratios of forage or to nurse

386
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
performance just by virtue of their

387
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,560
survival so that's sort of an

388
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,959
evolutionary circularity just like in

389
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,040
active inference we talk about how the

390
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,360
systems are resisting dissipation so

391
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,959
systems that are doing it it sort of

392
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,120
explains itself they're here and we

393
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
observe them because they're resisting

394
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,560
dissipation

395
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,440
and

396
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
it's really this question about

397
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
colony-level phenotypes that

398
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,399
fascinates people who study collective

399
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
behavior because there's the traits that

400
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,680
a nest mate has which are not so

401
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
different than the traits that any other

402
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
insect has like six legs what's the

403
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
width of the head what's the gene

404
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
expression of the gland or the mid gut

405
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
like what digestive enzymes are they

406
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
making those are things you can measure

407
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,880
about one nest mate and so the body plan

408
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
in ants is really quite similar to all

409
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
insects

410
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
but then there's this really

411
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
qualitatively different level of

412
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,680
organization with a colony

413
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,120
and how do those phenotypes arise

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
how are those colony level phenotypes in

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
feedback with nest mate how does

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,839
selection

417
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
shape those phenotypes

418
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
nice thanks for your answer

419
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
um and there's a couple so maybe let's

420
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,279
go to the um

421
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,639
this slide

422
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
that shows like where you're measuring

423
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
the colony level

424
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,160
metrics or or

425
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,199
the

426
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,040
the coherence right like the colony

427
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,959
coherence or i forgot the term that was

428
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
used um but you

429
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
have the model or maybe maybe we should

430
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
start with the model really i guess so

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
so maybe do you want to just give us

432
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,279
like a quick overview

433
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,440
of like the model and the point of it

434
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
and um yep

435
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,079
let's go to slide 15 and so just to

436
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
bridge from the colony phenotypes back

437
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
to the specifics of the model it's sort

438
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,639
of like if there was a music festival

439
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
there's all kinds of phenotypes of the

440
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,199
individual participants like their

441
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
self-report where did they move how is

442
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
their decision-making being influenced

443
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
by their sensory stimuli but then there

444
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,400
would be certain descriptions

445
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,079
that you'd only have

446
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,959
one of for the whole music festival like

447
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
what is the average distance of people

448
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,959
so that's what we were studying with the

449
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
swarm coherence metric

450
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
but it just points that there's going to

451
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,799
be two

452
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
totally different types of phenotypes

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
some can be measured multiple times

454
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
within a colony per nest mate and other

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
times there's going to be phenotypes

456
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,440
that are only arising at the level of

457
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
the colony like the sex ratio or the

458
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
average distance

459
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,960
and what our

460
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
model did

461
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
was we specified

462
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
the process

463
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
by which the nest mates

464
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
basically perceived and acted so it was

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
an action and perception model

466
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
at the nest mate level we didn't

467
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
explicitly have a input or an output for

468
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
the quality not that it couldn't be done

469
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
you could also think about where that

470
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
might come into play maybe in dot 2. but

471
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,200
we

472
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
looked at a setting that has been used

473
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
to study colony decision making

474
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,360
and then

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
we specified a nest mate level model

476
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
and put it in this context where people

477
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
had already been using it to study the

478
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,520
dynamics of how colonies make decisions

479
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,320
so here it's called the t maze test and

480
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
there's two arms to the tmas the two um

481
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
red arrows on the left side here of

482
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
figure 1a

483
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,919
and food is on one side of the tea maze

484
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
and it can either be static or it can be

485
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,679
switching and this is something that

486
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
they use in

487
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
lab rat experiments as well

488
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,400
so the colonies task is to basically get

489
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
food

490
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
but

491
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240
what we did is we didn't actually encode

492
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
that as like a colony level goal

493
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
we really went down to the nest mate

494
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
level and we specified

495
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
just like any other active inference

496
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
model what are the sensory observations

497
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
made by nest mates which in this case

498
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
was just the pheromone density of the

499
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,039
squares around them

500
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
what are the action affordances of each

501
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
nest mate which is sort of it can move

502
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
in any of the adjacent squares

503
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
and then

504
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
what's the generative model

505
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
which entails a preferences and a free

506
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
energy minimization happening inside the

507
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
nest mate at each time point

508
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
so that given the observations at a

509
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
certain time

510
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
the actions are selected and in this

511
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
case the preference was for more of the

512
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
pheromone so like the pheromone can be

513
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,000
interpreted as a

514
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
attractant something that the aunt

515
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
pursues or prefers to observe

516
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
and um

517
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
the only other tweak which is what

518
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,080
introduced the pheromone in the first

519
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
place and the whole concept of stigma g

520
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,440
was that on the way in after they've

521
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,080
touched the seed but not before

522
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
they also deposit pheromone so that was

523
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
an additional action affordance to

524
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
deploy pheromone and there wasn't any

525
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
decision making about that it was just

526
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
if you've already touched the seed then

527
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
you lay down the pheromone and if not

528
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
you don't

529
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
and so it's sort of like those simple

530
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
rules

531
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
pursue regions of higher pheromone

532
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
density

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,799
lay down pheromone if you've touched a

534
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,880
seed but not if you haven't

535
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,559
those two rules

536
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,600
at the nest mate level recapitulate

537
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
some of the phenotypic dynamics of

538
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,720
colony decision making so that's why

539
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
it's fun to think about like maybe we

540
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
can look at complex collective phenomena

541
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
and then understand how they emerge from

542
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,480
simple interactions among agents and

543
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
agents in their environment

544
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,799
nice stephen

545
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,840
just a quick question is i'd be

546
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,039
interested because you've got say one

547
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,559
ant that goes off

548
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,120
foraging type of thing and then maybe

549
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
you've got the second one that follows

550
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
and then i suppose there's

551
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
what goes back to

552
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,600
the nest if i'm right um

553
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
yeah i was just wondering like

554
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,720
how much

555
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
more complex or does it help to have

556
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
more in the modeling or does it make it

557
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
more challenging to start using too many

558
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
ants

559
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,640
so we templated the natural history if

560
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
you will of this off of a formica ant

561
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
species um like a wood ant so it's

562
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
referenced in the paper

563
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,799
this dynamic of like go out without

564
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,400
leaving pheromone come back with

565
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
pheromone so given that natural history

566
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,760
to change the number of ants from two to

567
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,720
two thousand to two million it's just a

568
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
number in the config file

569
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
when you run the code so it actually is

570
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
not challenging to scale the colony's

571
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
size

572
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
it might burden your computer or cause

573
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
some other limitations and it certainly

574
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
will change the collective outcomes

575
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
maybe in a linear or maybe in a

576
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
non-linear way like we explored in the

577
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,320
figure three

578
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,280
but

579
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,760
there are so many natural histories and

580
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
ways that ants forage

581
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
like there's tandem

582
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,679
running or like an ant remembers where

583
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
the food is

584
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
and then it does like a leap frog and it

585
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
takes an uninitiated ants nest mate

586
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
and leaves it and then when those two

587
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,799
return they bring back four and then

588
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,960
there's eight so there's all kinds of

589
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,840
recruitment and food

590
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,159
localization strategies in ants which is

591
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,760
why it's important that there's not just

592
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
like one single way that ants forage

593
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,159
because they're looking for things that

594
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,679
have different regularities in the

595
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,720
environment

596
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
so

597
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
within a natural history the script is

598
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,799
written in a way where it's pretty easy

599
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
to change the map shape or to change the

600
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
number of ants or their appearance

601
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,440
dynamics

602
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
and then a little bit of the challenge

603
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
would be like to adapt it or transpose

604
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640
it to a different natural history or to

605
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
add multiple interacting pheromones or

606
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
other kinds of things like interactions

607
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,200
amongst the ants

608
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
marco

609
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,240
yeah

610
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
sorry i just wanted to ask about the the

611
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
the model as it is described in the

612
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
paper because um

613
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,720
at the beginning the ants have basically

614
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
random movements right because all the

615
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
surrounding step

616
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,400
movement opportunities are the same uh

617
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
probability right

618
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
so is it

619
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
sort of like a browning motion until the

620
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
first ant discovers the

621
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
the food source and then starts altering

622
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,799
the environment by

623
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,320
the pheromone

624
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
placement

625
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
that's exactly right and there's seven

626
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
supplemental videos gifts

627
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
where it's shown

628
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
and what it kind of looks like on this

629
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
team ace

630
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
it looks like you see these little

631
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,840
particles that start swelling and

632
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,240
diffusing up from the bottom so that's a

633
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,400
total brownian walk because there's no

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,559
preference for direction when there's no

635
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
pheromone deposited

636
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
and then

637
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
you see one ant find the seed

638
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
and then it starts laying down this

639
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,679
pheromone but it's also diffusing

640
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,880
randomly

641
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
because at least initially there's also

642
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
no preference for direction but then you

643
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,000
can imagine that there starts being a

644
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
higher concentration of pheromone on the

645
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
side with food

646
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
than not and eventually that gets

647
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
reinforced because it starts to attract

648
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
anyone who sort of diffuses into this

649
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,240
regime

650
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,279
of a locally increased pheromone density

651
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,919
they start to get pulled to the places

652
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,760
where there's increased density

653
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,480
and then that ends up reinforcing and as

654
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,080
soon as there's like a ridge of high

655
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,559
pheromone connecting the food back to

656
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,400
the nest entrance

657
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
that's the formation of a pheromone

658
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
trail so no ant needed a bird's eye view

659
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
or a goal to even form a trail

660
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,919
it's a purely agent-level

661
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,799
process-based explanation

662
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,840
by which you get the emergence of

663
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
a phenotype that goes beyond but one

664
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,240
nest mate knows or even prefers and

665
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
that's the existence of a trail now you

666
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
can imagine that colonies that have the

667
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
appropriate parameters like the right

668
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
amount of explore versus exploit how

669
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,000
much to follow one pheromone how rapidly

670
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
should the pheromone decay those

671
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,799
parameters are actually shaped by the

672
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
evolutionary process

673
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
colonies with maladaptive

674
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
decision-making of nest mates

675
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
are not going to bring home the seeds

676
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
they're not going to reproduce

677
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
whereas for any given niche

678
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,640
if the regularities can be captured

679
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,559
by the decision-making algorithm that

680
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,840
the ants use

681
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,760
you'll see those parameters plus slight

682
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
variations on them

683
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
in the future

684
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
awesome thank you and that kind of

685
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,120
brings us to a figure two which i um

686
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
threw up here and

687
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
i i clicked this quote from the paper so

688
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
it's talking about the rate of pheromone

689
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,159
decay and it says informationally this

690
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,039
decay rate can be thought thought of

691
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
thoughts of an environmental

692
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,039
perturbation or drift that counteracts

693
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,000
the reinforcing effect of stigmatic

694
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
convergence

695
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
and so in this and

696
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,080
here even in the figure legend it says

697
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
like we chose the representative

698
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
simulation did not turn the parameters

699
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
to discover optimal decision making

700
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,559
um and so i was just wondering if you

701
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,559
played with the decay rate at all

702
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,320
because i think about like if the

703
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,799
pheromone didn't decay

704
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,960
there would be a really difficult time

705
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
switching like from one arm to the maze

706
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
to the other when the food source

707
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,320
switches so you have to forget at some

708
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
point where the food was then this kind

709
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
of brings me to one of the big questions

710
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,120
is like how important is this decay rate

711
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
in like

712
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,039
the memory of anthony like so this is

713
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,640
clearly like an example of niche

714
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
modification where they lay down the

715
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
pheromone and it externalizes their

716
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,240
memory of where the food is for other

717
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,159
ants in the colony but there's this um

718
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,080
you know it has to decay otherwise

719
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
they're just confused like if we were

720
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
flooded all of the time with all of our

721
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
memories like unable to distinguish our

722
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,880
our memory from the present time which

723
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
happens in some forms of you know uh

724
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
neuro neuro like diseases narrow

725
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
atypical people have this like you know

726
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,919
inability to distinguish the present

727
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,320
from the past from the future so

728
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
just is that like a critical thing or do

729
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
you have any comments on that maybe or

730
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,960
maybe stephen wants to comment on what i

731
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,799
said and then uh you comment or stephen

732
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,080
do you want to go first or what do you

733
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,320
think okay yeah i'll just add one thing

734
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,080
to that um

735
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
yeah i think that's a

736
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
um

737
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,440
a good point is i suppose how much does

738
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
the ability to

739
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,480
um

740
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,320
allow the environment

741
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,159
um

742
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,440
to re

743
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
i suppose re-remember i'm not really

744
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
remember but reformulate so you may not

745
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
need to forget as much as just

746
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,840
change how much you're weighting what

747
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
you

748
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,559
you um

749
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
give priority to so in a way

750
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,120
it's like by knowing something that

751
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
you're more certain about it might get

752
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,720
something similar so i'll be interested

753
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,159
about

754
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,600
that idea of

755
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,679
you know offloading onto the environment

756
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
and how that maybe

757
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,799
negate some of that anyway

758
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,559
yes so it is um akin to forgetting

759
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
but what's really interesting is it's

760
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,120
the colony for getting because the ant

761
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,440
doesn't have a direct memory

762
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
so as we encoded it so it's a lot like

763
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
cumulative culture

764
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,919
there's a totally

765
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,720
qualitative difference between what an

766
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,919
individual remembers on board and then

767
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,279
what the culture remembers and so we do

768
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,320
modification on our cultural niche

769
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,919
breeding scott

770
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,360
and so that enables new dynamics of

771
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
learning and forgetting

772
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
which are distinct have different

773
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
mechanisms than the ones that happen at

774
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
the nest slash individual person

775
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
level

776
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,080
and so it is um a forgetting that occurs

777
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
and otherwise you would get stigmatic

778
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
reinforcement stigmatic tightening and

779
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,039
it would end up just being over fit to

780
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,960
the way things were

781
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
and then you wouldn't be able to access

782
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,679
new resources or have the flexibility to

783
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,480
find

784
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
the seed after it moves to the other

785
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
branch

786
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
awesome

787
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
sorry did you have something else to add

788
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,640
how goes it scott

789
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,799
hi scott

790
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,080
um so here we'll switch on to oh steven

791
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,399
go ahead soon

792
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,679
yeah just one thing daniel i was

793
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
wondering how much you think i mean i

794
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,799
know it's an ant model but you know

795
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,279
you're talking about extrapolating to

796
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,480
beyond

797
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
how like you just mentioned that with

798
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
culture so that

799
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,679
um i wonder if there's some principles

800
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,840
that starting to emerge that you think

801
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,720
you're kind of curious about exploring

802
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,720
further because of that ability to

803
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
think differently about how we

804
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,520
know

805
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
the precursor model

806
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,640
to active inference was actually

807
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
on slide 53

808
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
the acquisition of culturally patterned

809
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,960
attention styles under active inference

810
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
so this was a visual scanning

811
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,320
visual foraging model where the eyes

812
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
scanned over pottery designs

813
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
and there were cultural preferences for

814
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
certain local motifs

815
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,279
and so

816
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,840
it's kind of interesting that we almost

817
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,279
stripped

818
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,080
the cultural interpretation away

819
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,120
to apply it to ants and i do think that

820
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,360
it could be

821
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,399
re-integrated in

822
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,919
it just helps us clarify that we can

823
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,919
know what the individual level

824
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,080
mechanisms are like of personal

825
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
preference what is being sensed by the

826
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,039
person and what are their action

827
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
affordances kind of like all the

828
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,360
variables in the active inference model

829
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,080
perception cognition and action

830
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,039
and then the external states

831
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
can be other agents and we've talked

832
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,720
about communicating agents before but

833
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
the external states can also be

834
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
something that's cumulatively modified

835
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,320
and so when your sensory capacities

836
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,720
include the ability to read websites

837
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
and then your action affordances include

838
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
the ability to modify websites

839
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,799
it would take transposing the model into

840
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
those different

841
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,519
inputs generative models and outputs

842
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,760
but it does suggest that we don't have

843
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,559
to make everything only existing as a

844
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
function of interactions amongst active

845
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
inference agents in fact cumulative

846
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,360
culture helps us distinguish pieces that

847
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
are clearly cognitive clearly on board

848
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
from outcomes that are clearly

849
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,399
cumulative and have memory that isn't

850
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,158
just what the agent remembers

851
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
almost gives a a rationale for fashion

852
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
in a way could be interested in as well

853
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
when you think about design and of

854
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,600
pottery there's a fashion that there's

855
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
there's a fashion of other things as

856
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,440
well

857
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
that that makes me think about like who

858
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,200
controls how the seed switches arms so

859
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
here it's the spatial movement of the

860
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,640
seed from one side to the other and the

861
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,519
switching dynamics but fashion i mean i

862
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
guess what people wear or just like oh

863
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,679
it's a fashionable book

864
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,840
it's sort of a way in which

865
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,120
people's

866
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
niche modifications include locating and

867
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,640
moving or hiding seeds and it's like oh

868
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
you didn't know about this band like i

869
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,200
foraged better because i know this band

870
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,120
that you don't know that's sort of like

871
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,600
hipster informational foraging

872
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,399
and so how do people signal

873
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,240
through fashions you know keep up with

874
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,640
the time cubism is the art that we all

875
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,120
look at this is what we think is cool or

876
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,240
this seed location is no longer in vogue

877
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,880
so maybe some types of foraging

878
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,080
metaphors

879
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,519
could help us understand cultural

880
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,000
phenomena

881
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,679
that also feels like hope

882
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,799
that also feels like irving goffman kind

883
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,480
of reference of projecting out as you

884
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
want to be perceived that those

885
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,840
recursivity

886
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
so that you you know if you want to be

887
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
perceived as a mountain climber you wear

888
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,399
a shirt from a mountain climbing store

889
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,880
um and so you're you're expressing a

890
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
thing and you want to be perceived as

891
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,559
that so there's that kind of that mirror

892
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,200
effect that goes on um uh

893
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,399
to define ourselves by how others see us

894
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,200
it also reminds me the earlier notion of

895
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,279
the cumulative embodiment

896
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,040
reminds me of the david bone work that

897
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,480
all reality is first a thought

898
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,399
and so the realities that are

899
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,719
accumulated are just accumulated

900
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,320
thoughts

901
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,000
that then become artifacts of that

902
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,760
interaction and then you know their

903
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,639
embodiment is left in that

904
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,520
intergenerational

905
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,440
communication

906
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,280
through language and through material

907
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,399
culture is where the mind resides

908
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,320
really in the interaction with those

909
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
things

910
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,839
so we're able to communicate in deep

911
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,879
time that way they it reminds me that

912
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,079
quote that

913
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,159
bach and mozart didn't die they turned

914
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,879
into their music

915
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,280
right so we still communicate with them

916
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
we still hear them

917
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,839
at who they what they were communicating

918
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,599
out the realities that they were trying

919
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,760
to create became embodied

920
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,680
and they still available to us through

921
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,240
deep time and over space as well and so

922
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,520
that

923
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
maybe part of the cultural affordances

924
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
are the leveraging of the communication

925
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
the leveraging of self and identity

926
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,720
and you start to have people able to

927
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,640
pick up on those and and leverage

928
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
themselves and then they take it and

929
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,599
take it in a slightly different

930
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,119
direction then you have that

931
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,240
innovation

932
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,599
that happens and one of the things i

933
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,920
find fascinating is in fashion and in

934
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,640
food are two places you do not have

935
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,560
intellectual property protection of

936
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
copyright but they're the most

937
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,960
innovative or if you're from england in

938
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,760
innovative areas

939
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,119
which is fascinating right because they

940
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,520
don't need the excuse for intellectual

941
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
property laws the rationale is that it

942
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
helps to promote innovation but in fact

943
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,079
the most innovative things don't aren't

944
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,839
afforded that protection they're more in

945
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,040
a

946
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,040
foraging kind of um enthusiasms that

947
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,839
make those things

948
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
you end up

949
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,599
with the intergenerational maintenance

950
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
not just construction and enshrinement

951
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,119
of a pyramid but the actual ongoing

952
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
maintenance of

953
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
cumulative culture

954
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
whereas

955
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,480
it's not enough to just do it once and

956
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
then leave it behind and so it is

957
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,280
interesting about how

958
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,000
the

959
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,720
process and carrying the process forward

960
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
gives you the static objects of

961
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,760
cumulative culture but the cumulative

962
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,200
culture and the static objects

963
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,240
themselves

964
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
they don't map one to one onto a process

965
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
let alone adaptive one or a successful

966
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,839
one and so how do we

967
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,760
and that relates to um

968
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
the way that mod that reward was modeled

969
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
in this um simulation and also to

970
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,320
dopamine so i know we'll get there

971
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,400
awesome uh stephen and then scott

972
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
this reminds me as well i was that there

973
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,000
was a marketing manager that i once

974
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,760
spoke to and he was telling me what they

975
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,960
they pay

976
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,200
people to go into bars

977
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
and to drink certain drinks in trendy

978
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,240
clubs in like the big cities say in

979
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,920
london or whatever

980
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
so that they would be seen to be

981
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
drinking that drink

982
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
and then it starts to spark off of

983
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,320
course it's completely covert

984
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
but this sort of thing you can see how

985
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,480
that distorts people's um

986
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
stigmatic trail

987
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,920
because they see someone who's

988
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,839
presumably very good looking or

989
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,440
fashionable or very

990
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
high status or whatever

991
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,920
at the bar sitting on the stool drinking

992
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,720
the drink in a conspicuous way and they

993
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
they take the cues at some level so

994
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
anyway i thought that's interesting

995
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,880
for sure

996
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,240
okay so i think we can maybe move into

997
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,359
the

998
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,320
oh sorry oh sorry scott

999
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,800
i was looking i was looking for a shoot

1000
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,599
can you hear me

1001
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,480
yeah

1002
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,839
okay sorry i was looking for the

1003
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,280
controls i totally lost my screen to

1004
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
sort of screwed up um the end in the u.s

1005
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,520
stephen there's a thing i was looking

1006
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,200
for the word for it but there's actually

1007
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,960
when you go into a bar and say i'd like

1008
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,599
an absolute vodka please if you've been

1009
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,079
hired by absolute you're required to say

1010
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,160
i've been hired by absolute vodka i'd

1011
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
like an absolute vodka please they

1012
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
actually have a disclosure requirement

1013
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
for that exact behavior where people go

1014
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
in bars

1015
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
and if you're being paid you need to

1016
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
make a disclosure as a technical matter

1017
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,880
under

1018
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
under federal law so i thought that was

1019
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,599
pretty interesting

1020
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,720
um there was another point i was going

1021
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
to make but i spaced on it because your

1022
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
point i'd like your point so much

1023
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,760
sorry

1024
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
it's like an active um disclosure here's

1025
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
my preferences here's my expectations

1026
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,240
here's some components of my generative

1027
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,200
model right

1028
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,760
awesome

1029
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,560
yeah i was just wondering since uh since

1030
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,920
you were talking so much about the

1031
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,880
distributed cognition now and making

1032
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,760
sort of

1033
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,599
extrapolations there

1034
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,960
there clearly must be some limitations

1035
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,200
there right because

1036
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,240
i i

1037
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,640
assume or guess that

1038
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,000
like human culture societies

1039
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
have a larger capacity to change

1040
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,359
phenotype compared to let's say

1041
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
the limited

1042
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
variables that

1043
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,560
an ant colony might have and that might

1044
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,880
be subject to uh evolutionary pressures

1045
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,280
and and then is there let's say is there

1046
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
is there a

1047
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
larger um

1048
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,800
flexibility and phenotype for for human

1049
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,440
culture would you say

1050
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,760
we

1051
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,800
almost have affordances that include

1052
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
changing the hyper parameters the higher

1053
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,480
order parameters on our

1054
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,119
niche and clearly the scope of our niche

1055
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,400
modification

1056
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,319
has expanded as well

1057
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,319
so it'd be like if this ant colony you

1058
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,319
know we added another level it can

1059
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,640
decide where to move the seed to or it

1060
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,400
can decide to

1061
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,280
modify the structure of the maze i mean

1062
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
we know that ants build they build their

1063
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,960
nest architecture in many cases so

1064
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
what happens when you enable a new kind

1065
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
of performance

1066
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,599
it reveals like a whole new

1067
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,079
game theoretic or signaling theoretic

1068
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,200
dynamic

1069
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
that can

1070
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,839
flip

1071
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,000
how it would have been otherwise like in

1072
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,599
a fixed maze maybe there's a strategy

1073
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,640
that works

1074
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
but maybe if you add this ability to

1075
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,319
move blocks

1076
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,880
maybe the strategy is actually to um you

1077
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
know make a hypotenuse just going

1078
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,319
straight to the food so that totally

1079
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,480
changes which parameters of learning and

1080
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,599
forgetting

1081
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,040
you might want to have

1082
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,119
and so it's a very interesting question

1083
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,480
about how

1084
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,040
affordances come into play

1085
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
how do they interact

1086
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
and then

1087
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,319
what is happening with humans with our

1088
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,160
new affordances

1089
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,520
our ability to

1090
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,960
have long-range synchronous

1091
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,839
conversations and to make irreversible

1092
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,160
ecological decisions as well

1093
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,960
those affordances for niche modification

1094
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,440
and communication are changing what it

1095
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,160
means to be human

1096
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,160
definitely agree with that um as we kind

1097
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
of mentioned in the dot

1098
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,520
zero contextualization video

1099
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,960
any more thoughts on that or we can

1100
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,280
maybe move on to these colony

1101
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,880
level metrics in figure three

1102
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,680
figure three just to describe the two on

1103
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,960
23.

1104
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
um on the left

1105
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,560
is just a tally of basically the seeds

1106
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
returned home just the count of the

1107
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,240
round trips

1108
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,440
and then

1109
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
that is being shown through time steps

1110
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,599
on the x-axis

1111
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,400
for four different numbers of

1112
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,000
foragers like 10 30 50 and 70.

1113
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
and so

1114
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
again we weren't like tuning parameters

1115
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,520
or making statistical claims but it's

1116
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,280
interesting to see that

1117
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,079
the 30 50 and 70 the ones that kind of

1118
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,079
look like step funk same accumulation

1119
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,839
dynamics as the others do

1120
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,920
and then on the right side is that swarm

1121
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,720
coherence the um the

1122
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,760
distance metric amongst the nest mates

1123
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,200
and so again

1124
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,640
maybe this could be run out or it would

1125
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,079
be different on the map shape and all

1126
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,800
these other things but just to see that

1127
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,040
the average distance sort of increases

1128
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,720
and then stabilizes at a somewhat

1129
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
characteristic rate so these are

1130
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,680
phenotypes that nest mates don't have

1131
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,079
but they're composed of the phenotype

1132
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,560
the position the behavior etc of the

1133
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,960
nest mates and so again it just points

1134
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,040
to the need to be clear like when are we

1135
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
talking about

1136
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
individual level phenotypes that might

1137
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,280
be in feedback with environments or with

1138
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,359
collective outcomes and when are we

1139
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,520
actually talking about specifically

1140
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,560
collective outcomes

1141
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,599
nice

1142
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480
so i have a question that um

1143
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,720
you know relates to this directly so in

1144
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,640
this kind of colony cohesion or i think

1145
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
you call it form coherence

1146
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
um there's the

1147
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,800
distance metric that is measured but but

1148
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,119
in real ant colonies like are there

1149
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,000
other metrics that kind of are used to

1150
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,480
judge this kind of cohesion because i

1151
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,880
wonder about like the time that's spent

1152
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,440
communicating like ant communication

1153
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,000
time like does this also like enhance

1154
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,160
colony performance or what other kinds

1155
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,680
of metrics can you like use to determine

1156
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,960
this kind of cohesion

1157
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,760
we talked about this a lot with the

1158
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
authors and we so we thought okay well

1159
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,079
there's like the euclidean distance the

1160
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,319
average distance or the distribution of

1161
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,040
distances amongst estimates one could

1162
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,760
also look at the correlation

1163
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,800
of their trajectories so a perfect

1164
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,400
correlation of the trajectories would be

1165
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,280
like every ant is taking the same trip

1166
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,240
whereas no correlation of trajectory

1167
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,319
would mean like every ant was going on a

1168
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,560
different direction or having different

1169
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
movement dynamics and so that could be

1170
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,359
computed over the total trajectory of

1171
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,400
each ant or even at each time step

1172
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
like on the next time step

1173
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,040
zero correlation means like that

1174
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,119
there's 50 going up 50 going left 50

1175
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,880
going down 50 to the right

1176
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,359
or maybe there's like this sort of

1177
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,240
shift a coordinated shift within a time

1178
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
step as well as among time steps so

1179
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
looking at the correlation in

1180
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,680
trajectories the mutual information

1181
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,119
um these kinds of things could be

1182
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,040
calculated for the colony and then we

1183
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,240
thought you know it might not even be

1184
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,040
easy to rank these because what if the

1185
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,440
mutual information is low

1186
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,560
because they're doing different types of

1187
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,280
foraging and that is constituting a more

1188
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
coherent swarm

1189
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,560
so just because their correlation is

1190
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,440
high

1191
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,520
that's sort of like first pass oh well

1192
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,040
it must be a coherent swarm because

1193
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
everyone's taking the same trajectory

1194
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,880
but then there's this other type of

1195
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,160
coherence

1196
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,480
that might even be more emergence

1197
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,079
when the correlation or the mutual

1198
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
information of trajectories is low

1199
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,119
and it's actually by virtue of that that

1200
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,800
the colonies able to achieve things that

1201
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,599
the nest mates don't

1202
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,040
awesome thank you

1203
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,000
um

1204
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,240
stephen yeah can i just ask when you

1205
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,440
mention that

1206
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,240
could that um about the the different

1207
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,599
types of

1208
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,960
um

1209
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,599
movements and correlation

1210
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,920
um do you think that could

1211
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,839
point towards um

1212
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,800
how there could be different types of

1213
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,680
counter factuals brought to the table so

1214
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,280
as maybe the information coming back as

1215
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,800
well as being a seed it could be a

1216
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,079
counter factual um

1217
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,319
i i suppose the war it's not a seed but

1218
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,160
it's a wall or

1219
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
um that i don't know maybe that doesn't

1220
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,440
mean i haven't thought it through but

1221
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,040
i'm just wondering how counterfactuals

1222
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,599
might play out

1223
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,520
founder of factuals is it's an

1224
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,839
interesting question

1225
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,800
because it's a it's a mental ascription

1226
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,000
which

1227
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,800
we think we can do but then

1228
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
do ants do counterfactuals or how do

1229
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,040
they at least act as if

1230
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,920
and

1231
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,480
it's a great question just one thought

1232
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,440
would be

1233
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,760
the resilience of their algorithm

1234
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,880
is such that they act as if they're

1235
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
taking counterfactuals into account

1236
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,000
so for example their trail is functional

1237
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,440
when it's functional

1238
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,119
but then it's always like this adjacent

1239
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,319
possible that the trail could be

1240
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,319
disrupted and when the trail is

1241
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,920
disrupted

1242
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,480
they find a way to go around or to

1243
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,440
repair the trail and so it's like by

1244
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,720
having this

1245
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,079
counter factual like the adjacent

1246
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,280
possible that they might not have a

1247
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,200
functional pheromone density

1248
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,880
there's this self-repairing and

1249
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,520
regenerating aspect to their behavior in

1250
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,559
nature

1251
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,880
that makes it look as if they are

1252
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,040
accommodating these counterfactuals and

1253
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,480
it reminds me of one of the greatest

1254
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,280
disinfo scenes of all time in a bug's

1255
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,599
life i believe or maybe ants like where

1256
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,440
leaf drifts down

1257
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,119
and then all the ants are carrying the

1258
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,960
seed of course in their hands not in

1259
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,800
their mandibles which not how ants carry

1260
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,680
seeds and then like the overseer comes

1261
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
over and blows the whistle everybody

1262
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:02,960
stop

1263
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
you know the first ant that was

1264
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,119
returning home gets anxious

1265
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,599
it's like you couldn't stack

1266
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,839
i know it's just a movie so i know chill

1267
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,640
out etc but you couldn't stack more

1268
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,319
misconceptions

1269
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,640
into that representation of how

1270
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,520
resilience actually arises in foraging

1271
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,760
in overseer doesn't come

1272
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,359
and the first ant

1273
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,760
engages with the barrier

1274
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,720
and then goes around it or over it and

1275
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,960
that is what ends up allowing the rest

1276
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,800
of the ants who don't have communication

1277
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,200
with any overseer or even that first ant

1278
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,839
to participate in that

1279
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,800
re-functionalization of that part of the

1280
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,559
trail so

1281
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,319
it would be cool to see

1282
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,960
representations that don't disinform as

1283
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
to how ants actually

1284
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,800
work

1285
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,480
that's really cool

1286
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,400
that's a really cool response actually i

1287
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,000
also suppose

1288
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
you could flip that as well and say well

1289
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
maybe the adjacent possibles of these

1290
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,160
paths that the ants are taking in the

1291
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,000
environment is maybe that's how we get

1292
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,640
our counterfactuals in the brain

1293
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,400
it could be like

1294
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,880
a foraging path you know

1295
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,359
um i'm not saying that's how it is but

1296
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,359
maybe at times there's something

1297
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,000
that mirrors that but in in our own

1298
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,559
cognition

1299
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,920
scott

1300
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,359
you know that

1301
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,200
daniel that reminds me

1302
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,520
of our misunderstanding of how ants work

1303
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,920
it reminds me of the assertion i read

1304
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,760
that dogs

1305
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,680
in the wild don't have the alpha dog

1306
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,920
kind of characteristic and the impact

1307
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,839
mentality i don't know i don't know the

1308
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,599
research on this but

1309
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,640
that they learn that from humans

1310
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,040
that and so it's interesting we kind of

1311
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,280
project onto animals

1312
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,880
human ideas about

1313
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,559
stacking or

1314
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,599
whatever

1315
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,440
social status

1316
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,720
and it's fascinating to think

1317
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,160
whether in art because we were talking

1318
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,000
about fashion before

1319
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,839
might the arts

1320
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,920
be a vehicle for

1321
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,520
inviting humans to start to

1322
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,880
understand things that ants know

1323
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,240
right you know what what can we find

1324
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,359
from the art art world a movie or

1325
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,960
something like that which did a

1326
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,800
different treatment of it and started

1327
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,200
children embracing that right because

1328
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,040
these are children are learning from

1329
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,400
these movies

1330
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,640
it's a fascinating notion to think about

1331
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,520
how

1332
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,640
a more

1333
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,319
i use the word accurate portrayal but a

1334
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,800
more maybe sensitive portrayal to the

1335
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,280
dynamics of other biological beings

1336
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,839
might help us as biological beings to

1337
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,359
find our way

1338
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,839
because certainly the abstractions that

1339
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,400
we've we're teaching children now are

1340
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
not fully functional

1341
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,720
this so there may there's some

1342
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,960
additional learnings there the

1343
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,200
conversation i was on just before this

1344
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,880
we were talking about

1345
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,520
um capacity building in precarious

1346
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,559
populations and i was pointing out a

1347
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,680
similar kind of thing we were saying

1348
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,680
well we might have things to learn from

1349
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,599
precarious populations it might not just

1350
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,000
be parachuting in colonial type

1351
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,359
solutions but rather what can we learn

1352
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,559
from

1353
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,400
new discoveries

1354
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,640
and this was in the context of um the

1355
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,119
idea of bringing technology to for

1356
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,440
information to precarious populations

1357
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,000
but in the reverse of it bringing

1358
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,599
community

1359
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,400
knowledge to technologies

1360
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,480
the reverse flow and again similarly

1361
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
here maybe the community knowledge of

1362
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,680
ants

1363
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,760
needs to be brought to the technology

1364
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,599
architectures

1365
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,760
that we're talking about rather than us

1366
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,400
constantly being blinded to the

1367
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,839
architectural elements that we might

1368
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,920
have because we have these centralized

1369
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,000
elements these alpha dog notions these

1370
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
things that we project out

1371
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,240
so we're unable to learn because we're

1372
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,000
just imposing a structure on something

1373
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,599
that may not be there so we can't learn

1374
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,240
nice daniel

1375
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,599
the history of psychological projections

1376
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,880
onto the ants and the bees is tremendous

1377
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,599
it relates to sex and gender and

1378
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,400
politics i mean she's called the queen

1379
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,480
and she's called a she but she's just a

1380
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,920
diploid insect so how do we go

1381
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,240
from the words that we use

1382
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,319
and the kinds of models that we use to

1383
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,880
describe how the colony functions is it

1384
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,359
an economic maximizer is that the goal

1385
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,880
is gdp maximization or is getting seeds

1386
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,119
the goal and that was one of professor

1387
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,599
gordon's insights as well is like

1388
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,240
it's not just about maximizing the per

1389
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,480
capita return on foraging in terms of

1390
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,119
seeds which optimal foraging theory

1391
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,680
often suggested because in the desert

1392
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,079
it's costly to go out foraging you are

1393
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,480
spending water to get seeds which give

1394
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,160
you energy and water

1395
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
but it's kind of like there's a time

1396
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,760
where you don't actually need to get

1397
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,960
more seeds

1398
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,520
so the way that the projections occur

1399
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,599
and that they are mapped sometimes

1400
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,000
implicitly or explicitly to our human

1401
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
systems and and ideologies is very

1402
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,720
interesting and i think that relates

1403
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,960
more to this general point in active

1404
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
inference which is actually that sensory

1405
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,760
observations are ambiguous that's the

1406
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,400
insight of helmholtz

1407
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,040
and unconscious perception which is like

1408
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,599
the perception of ants even if the edge

1409
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,640
detection is relatively unambiguous

1410
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,359
what it is that the ants are doing

1411
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,040
whether they're taking care of every

1412
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,359
nest me and it's like utopia or they're

1413
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,359
sloughing off the useless ones and it's

1414
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,640
like hellish

1415
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,240
that's our projection

1416
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,319
and so that's why it's so interesting to

1417
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,839
have a model

1418
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,520
where we can be clear about what the

1419
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,040
sensory observations are of ants of of

1420
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,240
ourselves

1421
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,200
and then how our generative model

1422
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,280
is actually what is generating

1423
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,359
perception you know we see with our mind

1424
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,599
not with our eyes so the ant is also

1425
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,520
perceiving with its mind not just its

1426
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,920
antenna

1427
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,520
awesome stephen that's a really very

1428
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,599
very good point and also i think with

1429
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,920
helmholtz bringing that back in is

1430
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,119
really useful in terms of how we project

1431
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,800
because

1432
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,680
he was a way for us to get back to what

1433
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,599
we already knew it's like with all our

1434
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,040
intelligence we

1435
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,079
as psychology came in and this knowing

1436
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,880
and this perspective that knows

1437
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,839
and that becoming this almost unspoken

1438
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,440
axiom that we didn't even know was

1439
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,559
unspoken

1440
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,480
everything from there on in

1441
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,640
was about what do you think about this

1442
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,920
and what do you think about that and

1443
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,359
what do you think about the other and

1444
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,119
100 years later

1445
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,280
you know we're in all sorts of problems

1446
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,240
right

1447
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,319
um well were very quickly in all sorts

1448
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,960
of problems actually at the beginning so

1449
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,280
suddenly yet you know going back before

1450
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,880
then i'd be interesting to know about

1451
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,040
300 years ago they probably look at us

1452
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,720
with a wry smile and they'd be like

1453
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,680
yeah right because they hadn't had a

1454
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,440
whole load of other stuff

1455
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,160
that

1456
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,720
involves this knowledge of knowing as

1457
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,839
being about thinking and us and it was

1458
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,079
much more in the kind of

1459
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,280
you know unknown states of the world i

1460
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,040
mean their dictionaries weren't even

1461
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,799
there right so they didn't have that

1462
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,359
defined language in the same way

1463
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,440
um so yeah i think that's that's a nice

1464
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,760
point

1465
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,559
well lang

1466
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,319
language becomes oh sorry

1467
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,200
scott and then daniel

1468
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,680
language becomes that artifact again

1469
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,240
that's why i keep uh yeah again it's not

1470
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,720
it's not accurate what i say when i say

1471
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,960
the mind resides in language and

1472
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,720
material culture but it's i just keep

1473
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,400
saying it to get people off thinking

1474
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,040
that it resides in the brain

1475
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,200
and so it's it's just

1476
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,880
the

1477
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,720
that

1478
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,680
those traces we leave of prior

1479
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,960
interactions that seem functional

1480
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,079
become

1481
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,599
so ascendant you're born feral

1482
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,319
and then you kind of look and observe

1483
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,079
what works

1484
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,720
and it's so localized

1485
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,799
knowledge is so localized and now it's

1486
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,319
become the access to broad knowledge is

1487
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,680
is so

1488
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,799
great

1489
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,200
that there's nothing that suggests that

1490
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,520
the human lifespan was designed to be

1491
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
able to absorb all the knowledge that's

1492
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,000
now available right there's no we're not

1493
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,359
necessarily

1494
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,760
able to do it but we try i certainly try

1495
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,920
i got i'm surrounded look at all the all

1496
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,280
of us that have books around us you know

1497
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,040
we're like we're surrounded by so we're

1498
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,920
trying to

1499
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,000
figure all this stuff out but there's

1500
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,480
nothing that says we should be able to

1501
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,640
and certainly not as individuals right

1502
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,559
so then you then i start thinking well

1503
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,720
okay i'll take solace in the fact that

1504
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,799
we this is the synthetic intelligence

1505
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,240
thing i keep you happy about instead of

1506
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,000
artificial intelligence we know

1507
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,920
so that's good

1508
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,760
so that's pretty nice so that means that

1509
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
what i got to do is just cultivate the

1510
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,520
we not the i

1511
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,359
so that jump

1512
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,760
is what it feels like i'm wondering it

1513
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,520
just it feels like humans could be

1514
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,680
better served by

1515
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,200
at least being sensitive this we're not

1516
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,960
going to become ants

1517
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,119
right but we would be better served by a

1518
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,559
sensitivity of this and it feels like

1519
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,280
they

1520
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,400
there's a vast amount of human

1521
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,559
de-suffering that could be made

1522
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,799
available if if this could be made

1523
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,920
available and i'm not sure if it's

1524
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,160
through the arts or through economics or

1525
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,359
what the

1526
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,280
mechanisms of

1527
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,400
uh influence will be to allow

1528
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
the

1529
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,760
enjoyment

1530
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,799
of the

1531
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,920
additional solution space or additional

1532
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,119
um

1533
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,440
existential space that the these

1534
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,520
observations offer you know it doesn't

1535
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,480
necessarily change the way we act

1536
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,760
every day

1537
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,680
but it definitely could

1538
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,400
adjust the existential

1539
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,720
aspects of the human condition and that

1540
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,720
seems like they would indirectly serve

1541
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,720
to reduce anxiety

1542
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,720
and maybe hatred as a result

1543
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,200
anyway sorry for the ramble

1544
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,480
daniel

1545
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,440
stephen you brought up um 300 years ago

1546
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,079
and so it wasn't exactly 300 years ago

1547
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,240
but it's within about five to ten years

1548
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,400
of 300 years ago

1549
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,680
was a book called the fable of the bees

1550
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,240
private vices public benefits

1551
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,960
and

1552
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,720
i think it's it's worth reading one of

1553
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,119
the summaries of what this poem and book

1554
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,400
is about

1555
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
um the thesis is that contemporary

1556
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,319
society is an aggregation of

1557
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,880
self-interested individuals necessarily

1558
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,960
bound to one another neither by their

1559
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,200
shared civic commitments nor their moral

1560
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,920
rectitude but paradoxically by the

1561
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,480
tenuous bonds of envy competition and

1562
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,920
exploitation so it's a bit of a parable

1563
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,119
about

1564
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,680
private vice and public benefits in a

1565
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,640
bee colony and about how and why that

1566
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,960
succeeds or it doesn't

1567
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,480
and um

1568
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,960
let's work with the preferences and

1569
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,520
sensory capacities and affordances that

1570
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,799
we have

1571
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,559
and then think about how to engineer

1572
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,040
that with stigma g and cumulative

1573
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,960
culture to the kind of collective

1574
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,359
outcomes that we want to see

1575
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,640
rather than

1576
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,799
try to optimize it at potentially a

1577
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,559
lower level or without the whole picture

1578
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,839
in mind which could lead to not just um

1579
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,520
private vice but public vice as well

1580
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,280
nice

1581
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,720
yeah yeah thanks um so in a way what

1582
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,079
you're saying when he's when they're

1583
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,000
talking about envy and such like it's

1584
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,079
more like um

1585
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,480
i suppose

1586
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,720
phenotypical or social

1587
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,160
property

1588
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,079
rather than this

1589
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,920
individual

1590
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,319
oh you've got it well done so right but

1591
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,720
now we we've tend to now focus as an

1592
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,559
individual

1593
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,119
behavioral

1594
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,280
abnormality i suppose or and you lose

1595
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,960
that capacity

1596
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,119
or we've lost that capacity or

1597
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,280
and hopefully now we're gaining it to

1598
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,040
speak at that

1599
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,160
bigger

1600
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,240
level and not just the bigger level in

1601
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,160
terms of a statistical social science

1602
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,240
averaging but one where people are

1603
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,640
actually still purposefully engaged in

1604
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,000
the process

1605
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,160
so that mid scale type of thing

1606
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,480
so daniel and then i'll give my thought

1607
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,839
oh yeah blue

1608
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,079
oh so my um

1609
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,240
that kind of ties back to what scott was

1610
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,319
saying about um

1611
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,680
you know like all the books that you

1612
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,920
have around us and also into this like

1613
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,839
concept of synergy and it's something

1614
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,440
that i was thinking about like just

1615
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,760
yesterday we had this literacy report

1616
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,520
come out in new mexico that was just

1617
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,920
horrible right like the kids can't read

1618
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,400
i mean not for a long long long time but

1619
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,040
maybe you know it made me think like we

1620
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,280
are doing this method of communication

1621
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,280
here like via youtube and connecting

1622
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,520
like over support we're into this like

1623
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,400
oratory or even like i don't know audio

1624
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,319
visual like is there a is there a big

1625
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,680
bigger word for that

1626
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,640
like a video transduction of information

1627
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,280
and it's like are we you know maybe the

1628
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,880
need to read and write is becoming

1629
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,960
obsolete i mean as we're moving in and

1630
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,079
as we're

1631
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,240
you know externalizing all of this into

1632
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,559
our niche environment i mean

1633
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,640
in the history of early humans history

1634
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,119
was an oral tradition and then it became

1635
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,799
a written tradition and now maybe the

1636
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,040
need for reading and writing is is not

1637
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,799
there because we're back into this

1638
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,520
ability to directly communicate across

1639
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,240
vast distances and to leave recorded

1640
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
traces of this audio visual

1641
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,440
communication

1642
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,839
in time i mean yes in a media that's

1643
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,280
less permanent i mean if the internet

1644
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,119
survives or whatever but i mean we're

1645
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,480
all under the assumption that you know

1646
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,880
in 50 years if humans are still alive

1647
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,400
this video will be archived in the

1648
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,720
wayback machine or somewhere right and

1649
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,799
so maybe are we are we losing the need

1650
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,880
for that i don't know just a thought

1651
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,720
ah damn good

1652
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,640
so i'll give a comment on that related

1653
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,880
to ant brains and then we can go to the

1654
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,559
dopamine discussion

1655
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,720
so there's um a scaling relationship

1656
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,720
that people have observed with social

1657
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,760
mammals

1658
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,680
where the larger the group size of the

1659
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,200
mammal the larger the relative brain is

1660
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,440
so that suggests that sociality in

1661
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,240
mammals includes like memory

1662
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,720
the ability to simulate counterfactuals

1663
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
potentially theory of mind or thinking

1664
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,240
through other minds like we talk about

1665
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,799
in active inference but being social for

1666
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,000
mammals is clearly like a cognitive load

1667
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,839
and in the ants

1668
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,839
a trend in the other direction is

1669
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,119
observed where larger colony sizes have

1670
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,880
often smaller

1671
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,440
relative brain size of the workers

1672
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,880
and that's one of the key differences

1673
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,440
between social and youth social so a lot

1674
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,880
of times people will talk about the bees

1675
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,960
and the ants as being social as if

1676
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,480
they're hanging out or doing it because

1677
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,799
they like each other but the reality is

1678
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,200
that ants have been colony living for

1679
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,160
120 million years of evolution slash one

1680
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,839
creation however you want to look at it

1681
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,920
and they're not doing it just to hang

1682
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,720
out

1683
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,000
so it shows that once you make this

1684
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,960
phase transition from social which might

1685
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,280
have increased cognitive burden to you

1686
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,200
social it might be associated with

1687
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,920
decreased cognitive burden and decreased

1688
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,160
cognitive necessity of the individuals

1689
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,240
because it's like it's good to follow

1690
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,920
the trail and go off on your own and

1691
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,760
just wander around and leave the trail

1692
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,000
when you find new food etc those are

1693
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,280
simple rules

1694
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,680
that aren't necessarily requiring

1695
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,680
tremendous onboard cognition yeah scott

1696
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,160
maybe that's why um populations of

1697
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,079
humans don't have to be educated

1698
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,559
maybe we're going back to that and say

1699
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,440
maybe we don't need high levels of

1700
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,440
teaching for everybody in society

1701
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,680
there will always be there's always

1702
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,359
going to be a distribution of education

1703
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,319
and many dimensions of that education

1704
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,839
and um

1705
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,599
all we can hope is that the cumulative

1706
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,400
context supports everyone i mean the

1707
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,440
reality is even even if we tried not

1708
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,880
everyone's going to be a brain surgeon

1709
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,559
and a rocket scientist and an ant

1710
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,200
scientist and this and a lawyer and a

1711
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,640
doctor and a grocer right so we have to

1712
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,839
specialize and

1713
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,680
parse and so it's kind of interesting

1714
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,520
because the aspiration

1715
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,119
of self

1716
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,680
cultivation suggests that you want to

1717
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,200
have a you know

1718
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,359
strong body strong mind and every

1719
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,680
individual needs to be the

1720
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,760
representation of everything but it's

1721
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,599
not maybe that

1722
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,359
aspiration

1723
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,319
of power being residing in an individual

1724
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,680
through individual capacities is

1725
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,680
not scalable you know even though it's

1726
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,599
observed in mammals at a certain scale

1727
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,200
maybe at a certain scale you have to be

1728
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,280
used social because the intrinsic

1729
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,599
complexity of the society and the

1730
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,520
information available is such that it's

1731
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,720
impossible

1732
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,599
to reside in a single

1733
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:22,559
brain

1734
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,319
but the again

1735
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,480
one of the things i say is that

1736
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,200
i

1737
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,799
tell people the brain is infinitely

1738
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,599
capacious because it's just an antenna

1739
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,440
and it's just tuning into the mind which

1740
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
itself has whatever capacity every

1741
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,880
capacity

1742
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,599
so again maybe we need to train more not

1743
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,319
in substance but in process of learning

1744
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,640
or in knowledge discovery rather than in

1745
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,160
facts

1746
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,000
so that people can

1747
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,200
navigate the mind that's collective

1748
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,200
with their brain that's an antenna

1749
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,440
i have a similar thought actually scott

1750
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,760
like maybe i mean we're we're becoming

1751
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,640
so

1752
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,960
connected like you know in

1753
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,599
even just 100 years ago we were

1754
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,559
very dispersed and so maybe as we're

1755
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,480
becoming more connected we're becoming

1756
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,559
more like a high having developing more

1757
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,760
of like a high

1758
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760
mind where like the reliance on

1759
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,880
individual

1760
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,079
survival or cognition is is less so

1761
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,240
stephen and then we'll go to daniel and

1762
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,160
ant brains i'm just going to say just in

1763
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,079
instead of just in time manufacturing is

1764
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,039
just in time thinking

1765
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,319
and also tying into that process piece

1766
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,799
um you know how much

1767
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,559
it is about

1768
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,799
getting the knowledge i either book off

1769
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,000
the shelf and how much is it knowing

1770
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,359
the policies for how to engage that book

1771
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,400
can be the thing and that's where it can

1772
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,559
be valuable to see an old video ought to

1773
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,240
have met you know someone who actually

1774
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,839
met einstein

1775
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:56,000
would have known that other side to how

1776
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,799
he

1777
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,640
wrote those books right we just have

1778
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,400
this encoded form

1779
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,920
and there's other ways things can be

1780
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,760
encoded right

1781
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,079
um and that may be what you experience

1782
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,440
when you have a

1783
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,920
chat with someone maybe a professor or

1784
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,079
someone who wrote the book which is very

1785
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:12,960
um

1786
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,920
there's there's there's that quality to

1787
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,039
it and that that might be um

1788
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,880
something where

1789
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,400
thinking about because in a way these

1790
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,559
ants really they've got to

1791
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,119
have trust in their action policies

1792
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,039
scaffolded by

1793
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,319
some sort of

1794
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,920
pheromone trail

1795
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,480
and we in if you actually look at most

1796
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,760
psychiatry is basically taking the

1797
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,079
individual and trying to maybe reduce

1798
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,960
their anxiety or the distortions

1799
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,119
changing serotonin or

1800
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,039
dopamine levels

1801
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,000
um

1802
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,440
and i think what this is showing is well

1803
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,200
you know

1804
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,280
that might make someone less anxious and

1805
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,039
less

1806
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,039
you know less challenged in their

1807
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,960
integration into society but there's

1808
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,599
another there might be other ways

1809
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,160
and that speaks to eco psychology and

1810
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,839
other things which maybe seemed a little

1811
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,839
bit hippie before but they can be

1812
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,760
scientifically rigorous

1813
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,880
from what we're talking about and

1814
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,198
that's great

1815
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,880
so just a quick little interject

1816
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,560
question because steven brought it up

1817
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,920
and this is something that i've been

1818
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,359
like thinking about and i was gonna

1819
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,719
bring it up with with the counter

1820
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,439
factual point but like is there a role

1821
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,359
for trust in the social insect synergy

1822
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,520
like like can you maybe daniel has

1823
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,238
examples of ants that are liars or ants

1824
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,000
that can't be trusted or like is there

1825
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,719
some kind of like deviant form of ant

1826
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,640
thought or behavior and then what it

1827
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,880
brings

1828
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,120
i'll give one interesting example of

1829
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,479
that which is

1830
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,439
um under the clean division of labor

1831
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,198
model one would expect that queens

1832
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,040
should just be like super fertile and

1833
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,198
workers should never have any capacity

1834
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,560
for fertility

1835
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,279
and so when it was found empirically

1836
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,319
in honeybees and in some ants that some

1837
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,120
workers had partially activated ovaries

1838
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,880
like they retained the capacity to

1839
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,000
reproduce

1840
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,080
which is also facilitated in those

1841
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,880
insects because unfertilized females can

1842
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,238
make male eggs just by making a haploid

1843
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,439
egg

1844
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,238
initially that was framed as cheating

1845
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,319
and it was in the um the game theory of

1846
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,158
cheating and all of these ways that you

1847
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,319
could think about economic exploitation

1848
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,920
free rider problem

1849
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,719
but at the same time it's the case that

1850
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,799
queens do die

1851
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,120
and when that happens the call in me is

1852
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,279
almost hedging its bets against one

1853
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,560
failure mode by having this just-in-time

1854
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,120
capacity to salvage some reproductive

1855
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,920
fitness with pre-activated workers

1856
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,279
so was it deceptive at one level was it

1857
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,679
adaptive at another level there's many

1858
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,000
examples like that and i would say it

1859
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,199
all falls under that ambiguous stimulus

1860
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,600
heading i'll ask a question from the

1861
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,280
chat and then we can because it will

1862
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,120
take us towards the brain

1863
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,360
um sergio asks

1864
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,920
how can the autonomy of an agent for

1865
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,719
example an immune b cell living within

1866
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,960
another autonomous meta agent like a

1867
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,000
mammal

1868
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,560
be accounted by colony behavior and

1869
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,880
stigma g

1870
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,320
it's an awesome

1871
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,280
question it speaks to the nested

1872
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,560
formalisms

1873
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,679
so ants also have mobile cells and we're

1874
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,239
abstracting around that when we just

1875
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,159
have a nest mate level model

1876
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,800
but potentially nested modeling could

1877
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,159
speak to that because t cells um are

1878
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,719
perceiving their local niche

1879
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,880
and then they're they're acting in their

1880
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,480
niche they're releasing cytokines and

1881
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,960
they're um changing the immune context

1882
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,560
which could bring other t cells or b

1883
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,600
cells down and then i posted a paper

1884
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,760
distributed adaptive search in t cells

1885
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,560
lessons from ants with professor gordon

1886
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,199
and others that was explicitly about

1887
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,800
that it was like a triple play

1888
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,320
collaboration with ants immune cells and

1889
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,719
computational search algorithms

1890
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,800
and the way in which computational

1891
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
search algorithms and computational

1892
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,320
frameworks like active inference

1893
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,080
although not in that paper

1894
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,280
give us a common descriptive ability

1895
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,640
across

1896
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,640
the ants and the t cells

1897
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,440
but then we once we frame it we learn

1898
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,199
from the ants and the t cells and the

1899
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,480
richness of nature and that expands

1900
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,199
our computational models so it's like a

1901
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,080
feedback in the informational niche

1902
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,520
between the kinds of cognitive and

1903
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,679
computational models we propose that

1904
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,440
helps us generalize and then we get

1905
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,080
surprised by ways that nature actually

1906
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,159
works out that feeds back into how we

1907
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,480
modify our models so maybe anyone else

1908
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,600
can give a

1909
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,320
comment on the the b cell and the ants

1910
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,679
and then otherwise we can go to the

1911
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,239
dopamine

1912
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,800
you think we're good

1913
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,480
yeah to go to the ants in the dopamine

1914
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,360
actually

1915
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,159
marco i was curious how i know it's a

1916
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,640
big question but how has dopamine

1917
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,159
been seen

1918
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,800
in the human neuro community and

1919
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,679
clinical side and where does act

1920
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:18,640
inference

1921
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,960
come into play or expand on that because

1922
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,520
i suspect that

1923
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,040
we might see some parallels with what

1924
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,719
it's doing in ants as well but what is

1925
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,719
the situation been and where is it going

1926
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,960
with human dopamine

1927
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,960
well i think that depends on who you're

1928
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,400
asking

1929
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,080
there is for sure one big uh focus on uh

1930
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,800
the rewarding effects or let's say the

1931
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,840
role of dopamine in

1932
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,199
addiction

1933
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,520
um and you know just as as a positive

1934
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,600
prediction error signal

1935
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,480
um but then of course you have so and

1936
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,440
and that

1937
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,000
you might put at the

1938
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
um you know at the dopamine uh

1939
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,719
tract that comes from the vta and goes

1940
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,640
basically throughout the the cortex and

1941
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,440
also to the nucleus accumbens but then

1942
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,840
you have also the the movement

1943
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,880
facilitatory role of dopamine which

1944
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,719
stems from the substantia and

1945
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,719
innervates the striatum and

1946
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,520
basically serves a

1947
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,679
action policy selection role

1948
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,719
via selecting competing affordances i

1949
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,480
guess you could say

1950
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,320
and and by that uh you select one um

1951
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,480
movement uh strategy

1952
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,560
and if uh

1953
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,760
you lack dopamine then uh basically you

1954
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,719
um you're freezing in your movements and

1955
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,640
that's one of the cardinal symptoms that

1956
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,760
you get in parkinson's disease

1957
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,360
and as an

1958
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,840
overarching principle i guess at least

1959
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,040
that's the intuition i have right now is

1960
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,800
that dopamine somehow modulates uh how

1961
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,000
some

1962
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,400
one like an agent interacts with the

1963
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,040
environments it's it's more this um this

1964
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,239
interface

1965
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,480
how how do you weight

1966
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,880
uh signals from the environment that you

1967
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,640
can react to

1968
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,040
and and that's i think the aspect that

1969
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,520
combines the the rewarding function of

1970
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,440
dopamine with the

1971
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,040
motion and action um

1972
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,840
permitting function

1973
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,080
yeah

1974
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,360
cool i see a lot of interesting

1975
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,080
parallels with the ant world so

1976
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,600
first for those who might not be

1977
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,719
familiar

1978
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,960
ants and invertebrates have a lot of the

1979
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,480
same molecules in their brain as mammals

1980
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,960
do so like some of the same exact

1981
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,800
neurotransmitters like serotonin and

1982
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,800
dopamine which is why some of the same

1983
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,719
drugs that mimic the structure of those

1984
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,199
neurotransmitters have effect in

1985
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,679
invertebrates as well as in vertebrates

1986
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,920
but they don't have the same

1987
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,760
anatomy of the brain so like you

1988
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,320
mentioned the vta and the substantia

1989
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,880
 the ants and the invertebrates

1990
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,960
don't have those exact structures

1991
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,440
however they do have some structures

1992
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,239
that play similar computational or

1993
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,440
functional roles so point one is that's

1994
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,440
an argument for why we need to look

1995
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,080
beyond just the brain layout of the

1996
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,199
mammals

1997
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:26,640
because not all cognitive systems

1998
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,120
inside or even beyond animals have that

1999
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,280
exact layout so it motivates just like

2000
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,880
we've been talking about like looking at

2001
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,600
the specifics really understanding how

2002
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,120
does

2003
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,960
these different dopaminergic signaling

2004
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,760
pathways work in the mammals but also

2005
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,760
what are they doing functionally and

2006
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,120
computationally so that we can

2007
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,239
understand and design other systems

2008
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,640
and then um

2009
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,280
dopamine has been studied

2010
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,280
for playing a role in the regulation of

2011
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,199
individual foraging

2012
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,679
in invertebrates as well as in

2013
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,360
vertebrates so people have done

2014
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,560
experiments with giving dopaminergic

2015
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,800
drugs to insects and seeing how it

2016
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,280
increases their foraging activity

2017
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,800
and even in the ants that are um shown

2018
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,000
on like slide 14 those ants the ant

2019
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,280
going into the

2020
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,120
nest entrance there is painted because

2021
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,280
it's been treated with dopamine so it's

2022
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,159
possible to collect ants and then either

2023
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,840
treat them with dopamine

2024
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,320
and measure how much it influences their

2025
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,239
dopamine levels in the brain

2026
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,840
we found that increases in brain

2027
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,560
dopamine through pharmacology increased

2028
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,960
foraging activity and we found that

2029
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
providing an inhibitor of dopamine

2030
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,679
synthesis decreased ants foraging

2031
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,679
activity relative to like a control

2032
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,800
group on the same day so on first pass

2033
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,920
that is consistent with this reward role

2034
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,400
for dopamine and that's

2035
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,719
the kind of empirical observations that

2036
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,880
people have found confirms their belief

2037
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,480
that dopamine is playing a role in

2038
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,679
reward

2039
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,440
but then what you said at the end there

2040
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,920
that reward and action come together

2041
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,520
with sensitivity

2042
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,440
and so we can actually add in something

2043
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,280
that we know about these ants and about

2044
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,760
other ants to think about

2045
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,000
how does dopamine play that role

2046
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,320
well in this ant species we know that

2047
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,440
individual nest mates make the decision

2048
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,840
to go foraging or not

2049
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,000
probabilistically depending on the rate

2050
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,239
of interactions that they have with

2051
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,199
incoming successful forager nest mates

2052
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,120
so if there's a high rate of incoming

2053
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,679
successful foragers it stimulates more

2054
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,320
foraging and if there's a low rate it

2055
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,159
sees this foraging activity it's like if

2056
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,080
you block incoming foragers from coming

2057
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,880
in there's a lag followed by a drop off

2058
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,560
in foragers leaving

2059
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,400
and if you have an excess of foragers

2060
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,320
coming in it leads to an excess going

2061
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,080
out which eventually does deplete the

2062
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,280
workforce so it's not like there's

2063
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,640
infinite ants they can just keep on

2064
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,719
sending but that's

2065
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,480
a self-regulating process so that when

2066
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,800
things are good and food is coming in

2067
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
send more it's a good day to forage but

2068
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,199
if there's only a trickle or there's

2069
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,120
like a predator blocking one of the

2070
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,640
paths then no more ants go out

2071
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,199
and so one of our hypotheses although it

2072
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,640
would take a few other kinds of

2073
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,480
experiments to really go into this in

2074
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,280
detail would be that dopamine plays a

2075
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,080
role in modulating the sensitivity to

2076
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,080
interactions of nest mates with each

2077
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,880
other

2078
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,520
and their sensitivity to changes in

2079
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,280
environmental conditions

2080
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,679
and so by framing what dopamine does as

2081
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,239
modulating precision or modulating

2082
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,480
sensitivity to interactions

2083
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,600
we integrate the mechanisms that we know

2084
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,280
actually underlie the regulation of

2085
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,280
foraging in ants

2086
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,280
with the empirical outcomes that

2087
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,199
increases of dopamine signaling

2088
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,800
increased foraging activity and

2089
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,719
decreases decreased foraging activity

2090
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,360
uh so stephen and then marvin

2091
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,280
i'd be interested where your thoughts

2092
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,760
are in terms of the type of foraging

2093
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,719
whether it's kind of an anxious

2094
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,719
like foraging if that makes sense

2095
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,760
because that could be because often um i

2096
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,400
think that some of the serotonin

2097
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,640
inhibiting uh

2098
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,640
medications they're helping

2099
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,719
to reduce anxiety and there could be a

2100
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,320
difference between

2101
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,159
the way people are reading those sensory

2102
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,040
inputs

2103
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,159
so i suppose could be could the ants be

2104
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,320
also foraging more

2105
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,080
if they're anxiously foraging if that

2106
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,560
makes sense maybe a sudden peak and then

2107
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,400
at some point they

2108
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,159
they there's that that doesn't become

2109
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,800
such a dominant dynamic for

2110
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,600
addressing reward

2111
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,040
do you want to respond daniel and then

2112
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,719
we'll go to marco

2113
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,960
yes there hasn't been a huge amount of

2114
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,840
work on serotonin forging but there is

2115
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,000
one paper i'll post in chat which is

2116
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,600
serotonin modulates worker

2117
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,440
responsiveness to trail pheromone in the

2118
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,120
ant phytoledentata so it is known that

2119
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,280
different neurotransmitter systems play

2120
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,199
a role in modulating the sensitivity to

2121
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,280
interactions and whether that gets

2122
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,239
psychologized or projected again

2123
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,679
i don't think that's always the right

2124
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,159
move to make but empirically serotonin

2125
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,040
does play a role there

2126
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,159
so that makes me wonder is um

2127
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,159
so the the neural modulators that you

2128
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,840
usually find in in

2129
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,040
mammal brains do they all exist in uh in

2130
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,360
ants as well like uh including um

2131
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,799
norepinephrine acetylcholine etc

2132
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,040
so it's a very interesting question

2133
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,800
there's some that are kind of like a

2134
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,199
level celebrities in vertebrates and

2135
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,639
invertebrates like dopamine and

2136
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,920
serotonin

2137
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,719
then

2138
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,960
epinephrine and norepinephrine which are

2139
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,199
very important for the regulation of

2140
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,600
arousal in vertebrates

2141
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,639
their functional roles are to a large

2142
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,080
extent played by actually the

2143
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,400
neurotransmitter pair of tyramine and

2144
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,360
octopamine in invertebrates which are

2145
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,520
trace amines

2146
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,520
received at the trace amine receptor in

2147
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,880
vertebrates and so the exact proportions

2148
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,120
of these different neurotransmitters

2149
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,080
differ

2150
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,880
in vertebrates and invertebrates but the

2151
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,719
metabolic enzymes

2152
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:17,520
are

2153
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,520
in the same gene families and that was

2154
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,760
some of the most interesting analyses

2155
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,840
was actually to look at the sequence

2156
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,040
evolution

2157
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,920
and the duplication and deletion events

2158
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,880
of the metabolic enzymes that transform

2159
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,040
neurotransmitters into each other from

2160
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,480
common amino acids into

2161
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,560
neurotransmitters synthesizing and

2162
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,760
degrading them

2163
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,280
and then the protein receptors that are

2164
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,360
used on the cell membrane like the

2165
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,239
dopamine receptor so the gene families

2166
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,440
are homologous the chemicals are

2167
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,560
similar

2168
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,440
and um neuropeptides there are some that

2169
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,199
are ancient gene families that are

2170
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,880
shared across animals

2171
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,120
and there's other vertebrate specific

2172
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,760
and invertebrate specific neuropeptide

2173
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,639
gene families so they're more similar

2174
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,480
than dissimilar

2175
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,280
and there's a massive amount of overlap

2176
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,520
and that's why again like drugs that are

2177
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,920
designed for working in one species

2178
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,480
often have a similar effect like

2179
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,159
neonicotinoid pesticides

2180
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,400
they affect the acetylcholine receptors

2181
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,639
of invertebrates broadly

2182
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,400
just like nicotine affects the

2183
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,320
acetylcholine receptors of humans

2184
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,960
right um yeah i think the the really

2185
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,600
cool um

2186
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,159
promise of active imprints is that you

2187
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,560
can understand different cognitive

2188
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,760
systems

2189
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,639
in terms of the messages that are being

2190
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:45,600
passed

2191
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,480
and

2192
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,159
and there are lots of comparisons you

2193
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:49,280
can make and

2194
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,360
i guess that's also a good um

2195
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,560
general test of the of the substance

2196
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,639
behind the whole framework

2197
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,960
to um to try and

2198
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,040
make those mappings

2199
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,040
where you say you have

2200
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,560
signals that get passed from bottom up

2201
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,159
like typically

2202
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,639
by a glutamatergic um

2203
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,120
trains of

2204
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,639
spikes let's say

2205
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,960
they might be matched by expectations

2206
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,040
that come from top down which might be

2207
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,440
inhibitory and then you have all sorts

2208
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,880
of uh modulatory uh signaling molecules

2209
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,480
that

2210
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,600
that's the precision of certain messages

2211
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,040
there

2212
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,920
so and and once you have that framework

2213
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,080
established you should be able to find

2214
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,800
it in all kinds of different cognitive

2215
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,600
systems whether they are structured like

2216
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,440
the brain where you have

2217
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,320
physical pathways that link one region

2218
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,480
and another or whether they are

2219
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,060
let's say

2220
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,639
[Music]

2221
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,080
more based on

2222
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,320
externalized

2223
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,639
elements like uh pheromone trails or

2224
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:57,840
whatever

2225
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,560
so

2226
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,880
i mean very much at the beginning but i

2227
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,360
think there's lots to discover

2228
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,040
yeah marco i just want to respond to

2229
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,800
that really quickly you know we were i

2230
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,719
don't know if you caught our last live

2231
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,840
stream i think it was 28.2 just the one

2232
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
that was last week but we were talking

2233
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,280
about um

2234
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,880
you know it's interesting we're talking

2235
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,239
about mental wandering like what does

2236
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,000
mental wandering have to do with like

2237
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,159
foraging or ants but there's a lot of a

2238
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,239
lot of connections to be drawn and

2239
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,280
really like

2240
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,440
we're thinking about um

2241
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,199
you know tracing a thought through the

2242
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,960
brain like like which is i mean my

2243
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,639
background is also neuroscience which is

2244
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,960
like passing a message from one neuron

2245
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,520
to the next neuron and really the basis

2246
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,520
of the paper was mental wandering and

2247
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,920
meditation and like the you know not

2248
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,239
suppression of thought but like when you

2249
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,840
consciously inhibit

2250
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,440
you know the thoughts from wandering

2251
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,080
around so it says mindfulness practice

2252
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:50,880
and

2253
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,960
it's really interesting because in the

2254
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,880
ant colony there's so many like

2255
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,280
relationships that i can see like i mean

2256
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,800
even between like foraging like when

2257
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,920
you're wandering and you're mental

2258
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,159
wandering is that like thought foraging

2259
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,320
or but i mean also more than that

2260
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,440
because there

2261
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,159
is that like synaptic release and so is

2262
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,840
that i wonder if that like synaptic

2263
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,080
release or synaptic transmission that

2264
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,719
happens in neurons is similar to this

2265
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,960
like pheromone deposition right so like

2266
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,560
you have synaptic release and that

2267
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,000
encourages more neurons to speak

2268
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,080
signaling so you have this pheromone

2269
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,400
deposition and that encourages more ants

2270
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,320
to keep foraging on those trails and so

2271
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,920
i really do wonder

2272
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,480
how much of the what our role

2273
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,280
is in neurotransmitters is externalized

2274
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,520
in this kind of niche

2275
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,800
modification and external cognition

2276
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,120
which would happen for us internally

2277
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,719
like but i wonder if the answer are

2278
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,639
doing that as part of this like high

2279
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,639
mind mentality

2280
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,280
um sorry steven i i was rambling yeah i

2281
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,239
know it's very very interesting points

2282
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,920
one thing i really picked up as well and

2283
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,199
i um with what you're saying in marco is

2284
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,440
this message passing that you have in

2285
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,000
active inference it is very liberating

2286
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,960
and

2287
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,679
and

2288
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,840
because you traditionally talked about

2289
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,400
in terms of signals and signals ends up

2290
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,159
maybe being electrical signals and it

2291
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,639
ends up being like a wire that we think

2292
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,719
of in the you know other

2293
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,040
like electronic world and and it's a

2294
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,800
very big trap you know so then there's

2295
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,639
somehow a signal going through and then

2296
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,639
next thing you know you you know

2297
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,880
everything implicitly or explicitly

2298
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,880
becomes a computer

2299
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,040
but this this just this general idea of

2300
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,000
message passing somehow

2301
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,320
so signals still it's hard not to make

2302
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,600
signals about you know a transmission

2303
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,440
system more like in a

2304
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,400
in a wire but message passing it at

2305
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,480
first i used to wonder why they're using

2306
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,400
that term because it seems so ambiguous

2307
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,880
and like what's going on with that but

2308
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,120
in some ways i can see is so much

2309
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,520
benefit from that

2310
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,120
from that that formulism

2311
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,280
cool daniel

2312
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,120
yes the signal

2313
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,520
and signal transduction signal

2314
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,679
processing which is frameworks that are

2315
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,600
used in electronics but also we talk

2316
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,520
about like signal transduction in the

2317
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,520
cell so it

2318
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,600
shows how wide the usage of that signal

2319
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,719
term is

2320
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:22,000
and it almost implies an essentialism to

2321
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,040
the meaning of the signal like it

2322
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,800
actually carries a meaning but when we

2323
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,199
think about message passing we can be

2324
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,920
clear about what that message is

2325
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,960
and then

2326
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,719
look at how the generative model

2327
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,159
interprets

2328
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,800
what is the incoming stimuli or

2329
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,080
observation

2330
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,400
instead of treating the signal as what

2331
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,120
is bearing meaning we can think about

2332
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,440
the stimuli as just being the empirical

2333
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,360
observation which as we've been

2334
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,520
discussing from the sensory level on up

2335
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,880
through the narrative

2336
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,280
observations are ambiguous

2337
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,440
and they require a generative model in

2338
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,320
order for sense making to occur and so

2339
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,239
agreed that not only is message passing

2340
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,800
away that bayesian models can be updated

2341
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,040
like we learned about from bert devries

2342
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,679
and others but it's also a way that we

2343
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,320
can step away from a sort of signal

2344
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,040
versus noise partitioning paradigm

2345
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,159
and move into an empirical observation

2346
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,120
meeting

2347
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,880
generative model meaning maker

2348
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,120
marco yeah uh so what i also like about

2349
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,199
this but i'm i might um have a

2350
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,800
completely different perspective on this

2351
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,320
than than uh

2352
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,400
you know you have but um the the

2353
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,880
the nice thing about messages is that uh

2354
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,719
it takes you away from

2355
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,679
this object orientation where you

2356
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,639
identify things and you can say they

2357
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,960
either are okay or they're

2358
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,400
malfunctioning

2359
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
but you rather look at the interaction

2360
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,840
between

2361
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,199
let's say vertices or objects

2362
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,320
and and you find

2363
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,360
maybe more illuminating answers there in

2364
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,120
if you think about

2365
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,280
psychopathology for example

2366
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,040
so that you can point to one brain

2367
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,560
structure and you say ah that brain

2368
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,639
structure is broken and that's why i

2369
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,719
have symptoms it's rather

2370
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:17,679
uh

2371
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,480
to think about it in terms of

2372
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,800
well maybe

2373
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,000
this message cannot be transmitted

2374
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,600
and uh and that's uh maybe the reason or

2375
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,520
or that's where you have to look for

2376
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,920
answers

2377
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,400
uh so one other thing about message

2378
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,199
passing that's i think a great way to

2379
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,040
think about active inferences it really

2380
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,000
grounds it in information theory because

2381
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,320
that's like shannon information is is

2382
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,400
like you know spawned from that idea of

2383
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,320
message passing and coherence and a

2384
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,120
message but also in the active inference

2385
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,880
framework it's always subject to

2386
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,320
interpretation

2387
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,960
uh stephen

2388
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,560
yes i um i was as i started to think as

2389
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,719
you were saying that marco about

2390
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,800
someone shaking hands with someone else

2391
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,239
okay so

2392
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,400
you transmit a handshake

2393
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,000
you pass a handshake you know i mean

2394
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,520
because both people have to reach out

2395
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,760
whereas when you transmit a signal it

2396
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,679
can be a one way a more than one way

2397
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,040
thing i suppose in some ways i think

2398
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,719
i i sort of agree what you're saying

2399
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,159
blue i also would say in some ways that

2400
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,159
shannon entropy is probably a bit

2401
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,560
stronger on the signal side

2402
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,520
um

2403
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,520
so in some ways it it gives that

2404
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,360
effective message passing but active

2405
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,440
inference goes further down well it

2406
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,440
seems to offer further down that route

2407
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,960
because

2408
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,639
it gives this um

2409
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,679
other way to extract so it's not like

2410
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,679
the noise is diminishing

2411
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,719
the signal um although

2412
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,199
it's it's there's other ways of getting

2413
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,600
that through action

2414
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,480
um what's in the signal um so i suppose

2415
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
in a way it's a bit like the handshake

2416
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,560
it's like what's that hand saying to me

2417
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,800
the funny handshake from the mason well

2418
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,840
i reach out and i hold it you know

2419
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,360
and i get a bit of a better feel and i

2420
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,679
see what i want to pass up my uh

2421
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,960
predictive processing chain

2422
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,760
daniel

2423
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,600
it just makes me

2424
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,760
think about how when we think about

2425
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,159
signal occurring amidst noise it's

2426
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,159
almost like we're getting one unit of

2427
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:33,280
stimuli whether it's rgb channels on the

2428
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,400
tv or whether it's a frequency range for

2429
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,719
audio or whatever it happens to be

2430
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,400
if the task is to

2431
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,480
find the signal in the noise we're

2432
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,400
always going to get less than one could

2433
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,440
be 99 signal to noise it could be 5

2434
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,520
so we're kind of always going less

2435
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,040
when we think about

2436
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,120
the stimuli as being a message that's

2437
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,880
passed to us and something that we

2438
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,239
enrich

2439
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:59,679
we can make it more than one so that

2440
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,880
secret handshake or that shape

2441
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,840
can be

2442
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,960
unpacked and understood in a broader

2443
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,000
context so for example how many you know

2444
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,480
bits of information does it take to

2445
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,400
communicate how to make lasagna or

2446
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,639
something it's like you don't need to

2447
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,639
describe every single

2448
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:19,920
sequence

2449
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,760
somebody who knows it only takes one bit

2450
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,679
of information maybe just the letter l

2451
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,120
or something like that

2452
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,400
and so

2453
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,800
signal processing again makes us think

2454
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,760
about diminishing and filtering out

2455
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,679
what we're getting in

2456
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,440
whereas maybe active inference helps

2457
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,960
moves us towards understandings where

2458
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,960
there's an enrichment of the information

2459
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,440
coming in which is always required but

2460
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,040
especially when there's sparse or

2461
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,719
ambiguous sensory stimuli

2462
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,440
nice steven

2463
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,960
that's a good point daniel i mean that

2464
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,719
sort of takes you to the value of varied

2465
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,600
stat fairy tales and yeah the idea i

2466
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,960
hadn't really thought about that before

2467
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,199
but the idea that

2468
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,520
the generative model

2469
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,320
is free to

2470
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,960
make more of something um and embellish

2471
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,320
it i suppose

2472
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,239
and of course that that may

2473
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:14,239
also really come into its own when

2474
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,239
you're bringing in multi-sensory

2475
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,400
information so you know

2476
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,560
there's there's this uncertainty but

2477
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,159
there may have to be something which

2478
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,760
embellishes

2479
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,239
um early on maybe that explains why

2480
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,239
children early on

2481
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,199
get very into dreams and uh

2482
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,520
very wacky sort of modeling of the world

2483
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,840
because

2484
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,639
um they maybe want to extrapolate beyond

2485
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,040
you know what that sound and that light

2486
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,199
source and that feeling and that smell

2487
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,440
of food is you know the porridge for the

2488
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,719
three bears that goldilocks is eating is

2489
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,800
is actually going to signify for them so

2490
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,679
yeah that's interesting

2491
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,120
so

2492
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,560
did we already have this like

2493
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,800
conversation about do ants dream of

2494
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,400
undead crumbs did we have that

2495
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,920
conversation daniel is there a book or

2496
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,360
something right

2497
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,000
i think you dreamed it okay okay so that

2498
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,120
brings me to my next question was

2499
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,920
it you know i wonder like i i just was

2500
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,159
um listening to josh steinbaum's lecture

2501
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,239
and i read his dream code dreamcoater

2502
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,880
paper in which like the computer

2503
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,679
explores like potential recombinations

2504
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,400
of symbols and stuff in like a it's like

2505
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,400
an off phase like a helmholtz machine

2506
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,639
there's like a wake sleep cycle in this

2507
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,760
algorithm that um he was using and so

2508
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,600
you know i mean i wonder i guess ants

2509
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,760
sleep i mean they like rest do they rest

2510
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,360
they have to like assimilate and update

2511
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,159
their generative model do they believe

2512
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:40,880
so

2513
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,440
people have studied circadian rhythm

2514
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,000
and the foragers have a strong circadian

2515
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
rhythm again probably not every single

2516
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,480
species but we did some work with gene

2517
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,639
expression and found gene expression

2518
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,119
cycling of circadian rhythm genes in the

2519
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,760
brains of foragers but not nurses in

2520
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,480
this species so nurses always indoors

2521
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,639
low-key working all the time they take a

2522
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,440
lot of micro naps and foragers have more

2523
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,639
like phasic circadian rhythms especially

2524
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,719
for insects that use the sun to navigate

2525
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,119
like honeybees well so what i really

2526
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,360
wonder is what about the collective

2527
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,360
um like ant

2528
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,880
generative model right like you think

2529
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,119
about the the this is like a collective

2530
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:24,960
behavioral or collective consciousness

2531
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,199
like is there you know dreaming or

2532
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,280
potential like recombination like

2533
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,679
exploration does that happen in like an

2534
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,400
ant colony

2535
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,239
it's an awesome question and another

2536
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:42,719
example of um true colony phenotypes

2537
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,880
and people have studied

2538
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,199
the activity waves

2539
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,960
in ant colonies

2540
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,159
over multiple time scales like a minute

2541
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,639
time scales as well as the circadian

2542
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,040
rhythms and that is actually not

2543
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,000
dissimilar from the multiple bands in

2544
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,440
the eeg

2545
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,840
so just like the electrical dynamics of

2546
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,000
the brain which present as one sort of

2547
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,159
just time series

2548
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,560
you can do a decomposition

2549
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,360
to extract out like the alpha and the

2550
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,560
beta and the theta bandwidths so just

2551
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,960
like there's only you know one 2.4

2552
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,080
gigahertz

2553
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,239
wi-fi wavelength

2554
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:24,080
yet there's multiple wi-fi networks that

2555
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,880
can co-exist so how does that multiple

2556
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,400
coding happen

2557
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,480
for the signals that we make like wi-fi

2558
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,000
and radio

2559
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,320
for the brain which is uh using

2560
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,360
different frequency bands simultaneously

2561
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,440
and there's also these oscillation

2562
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,800
dynamics in ant colonies

2563
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,880
so if the whole colony and this a wave

2564
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,960
like what i mean what kind of signal

2565
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,880
technology are you using to detect these

2566
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,560
waves i have to

2567
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,960
i'm not

2568
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:55,199
um

2569
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,520
similar to the way that the time series

2570
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,199
of the eeg

2571
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,440
you would do a sort of uh four-year

2572
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,760
decomposition to look at the different

2573
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,360
frequency modes

2574
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,760
similarly people look at the spatial

2575
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,119
position of ants and then can ask what

2576
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,760
are the activity dynamics through time

2577
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,800
and one paper i'll post in the chat is

2578
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,239
from 2016

2579
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:19,280
by gel

2580
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,760
all emergent oscillations assist

2581
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,159
obstacle negotiation during ant

2582
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,080
cooperative transport

2583
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,560
so actually having this sort of like

2584
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,400
oscillating

2585
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,400
group activity

2586
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,280
helps them not lock on

2587
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,440
too specifically to an object's

2588
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,679
direction that it's being pulled

2589
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,360
like if there's some object and then

2590
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,119
there's the nest entrance yeah okay

2591
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,719
we'll pull in a straight line isn't that

2592
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,960
the shortest distance between two points

2593
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,199
yes but first off no one knows exactly

2594
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,040
where the nest entrance is

2595
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,280
and second off even if it were the most

2596
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,040
direct it might not be the most

2597
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,040
resilient or tractable

2598
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,480
but if you just say okay you know we're

2599
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,760
gonna pull a little bit this way and

2600
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,360
zigzag it this way and zigzag it that

2601
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,080
way you get that wisdom of the nest

2602
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,679
mates because they each have a different

2603
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,760
estimate on exactly which way to go they

2604
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,320
get averaged out and if there's a little

2605
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,760
block somewhere

2606
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,320
built into the movement that this object

2607
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,320
is being brought home with is the

2608
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,400
ability to go around it

2609
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,960
and so that's another example about how

2610
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,760
processes that are dynamic at the very

2611
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,400
very micro level with the agents

2612
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,880
often constitute more adaptive emergent

2613
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,760
processes and more tractable ones it's

2614
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,360
like we either get the resilient

2615
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,960
tractable agent level rules or

2616
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,040
we get the fantasy well we should just

2617
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,719
move it in a straight line everybody

2618
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,480
should know exactly where to go and if

2619
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,159
they don't we're going to punish them

2620
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,280
it's not how it works

2621
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:51,040
awesome um and so that kind of leads

2622
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,960
nicely into i think we were talking

2623
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,639
already actually about like the wisdom

2624
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,880
of the crowd um and the example with the

2625
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,119
ox maybe that was in the dot zero or

2626
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:01,679
maybe last week but um

2627
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,080
it really leads me to thinking about um

2628
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,480
collective behavior and

2629
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,800
collective intelligence and just um that

2630
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,480
might be like a nice

2631
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,880
question for people to give thoughts on

2632
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,199
because i i just it's in my own interest

2633
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,800
to find out what other people think

2634
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,480
about the difference between collective

2635
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,719
behavior and collective intelligence and

2636
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:21,920
where is

2637
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,960
um you know any thoughts there on that

2638
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,440
stephen

2639
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,400
yeah

2640
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,920
sort of linking that and what you're

2641
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,600
just saying now with what daniel was

2642
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,800
just saying

2643
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,600
in some ways the brain so if you've got

2644
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,679
going more chaotic which i suppose in

2645
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,119
some ways you can do through your

2646
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:43,040
environment or just

2647
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,520
and the environment will do it to you

2648
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:46,480
um

2649
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,840
and then you've got this synchronization

2650
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,040
of

2651
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,320
waves

2652
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,480
as was mentioned

2653
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,639
so you could go from that kind of

2654
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,400
synchronization of waves and i suppose

2655
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,960
it could become more coordinated

2656
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,520
or it becomes more chaotic so you've got

2657
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,520
this kind of balance in terms of sense

2658
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,480
making between

2659
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,679
more entrainment between

2660
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,000
more coordination of action either

2661
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,679
between agents or between the

2662
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,400
sensory motor

2663
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,480
properties of the organism

2664
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,600
or

2665
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,520
which would in some way

2666
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,480
be more focused you would imagine

2667
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,719
and has that risk of rigidity but has

2668
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,719
the advantage of efficiency

2669
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:33,600
or

2670
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,080
um so brainwaves seems to have a bit of

2671
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,760
a bit of a mid you know this this

2672
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,280
synchronization of brainwaves gives you

2673
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,000
a sort of a mid-scale potential so it's

2674
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,080
not completely chaotic but it's not

2675
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,920
completely

2676
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,400
you know synchronized

2677
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,960
nice

2678
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,960
yeah i don't know i'm not sure

2679
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,000
what

2680
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,520
the difference is really between

2681
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,280
collective intelligence and collective

2682
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,480
behavior

2683
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,080
i um

2684
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,920
there's this cool diagram collective

2685
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,800
behavior and collective intelligence

2686
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,560
and it shows cooperation and

2687
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,800
coordination as essential to collective

2688
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,239
intelligence but but it also then like

2689
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,239
that those are both behavior cooperation

2690
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,639
and coordination and then what's left of

2691
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:25,760
cognition

2692
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,719
and so

2693
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:29,679
it's cognition intelligence or

2694
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,920
like what is cognition anybody have any

2695
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,080
like thoughts on i'm not marco i know

2696
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,840
your uh background is neuroscience so

2697
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,040
let's let daniel think and then i'm

2698
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,000
going to put you on the spot

2699
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,239
studying

2700
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,320
collective systems

2701
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,400
it always struck me as interesting

2702
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,719
because the organism is a collective of

2703
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,440
cells and so it's more like an approach

2704
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,480
that we take to any system to see it as

2705
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,440
arising from interactions at an even

2706
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,119
lower level

2707
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:02,000
and so when i look at these very human

2708
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,440
centric

2709
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,960
um

2710
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,760
thought maps informal thought maps

2711
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,199
it includes things that you know open

2712
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:12,639
source software p2p business

2713
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,760
those are human-centric and so it ends

2714
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,199
up

2715
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,600
muddying the waters and introducing a

2716
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,880
lot of psychology and game theory

2717
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,440
and terms that aren't like distinct like

2718
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,520
is cooperation distinct from a

2719
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,880
coordination

2720
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,960
and that's one reason why having a

2721
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,080
perception cognition action model

2722
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,920
even though it comes across as very

2723
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,119
austere

2724
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,040
and distant from the phenomena that we

2725
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,360
want to explain like coordination

2726
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,440
cooperation and cognition

2727
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,800
having such an austere but scalable and

2728
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,480
flexible model

2729
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,880
helps us get at these terms

2730
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,760
without presupposing them as natural

2731
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,400
things that exist in the world so we get

2732
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,440
to just model what is on the ground

2733
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,840
happening like with the ants or on the

2734
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,639
ground in another context and then ask

2735
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,199
how our definition or parameterization

2736
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,719
or formalization

2737
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,480
of coordination and cooperation are

2738
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,440
coexisting as descriptions

2739
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,679
of the process that we're specifying at

2740
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:20,159
the actual proximate mechanism level

2741
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,519
nice stephen and then marco

2742
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,679
yeah i think that

2743
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,520
that challenge of these things having a

2744
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,040
psychological or

2745
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,600
folk psychological or cultural

2746
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,880
labeling

2747
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,520
is is limiting and

2748
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,080
by stepping back from that

2749
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,239
might which in some ways makes creates

2750
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,800
more uncertainty i could say that it

2751
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,520
seems more austere but it's more austere

2752
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,679
because it is less

2753
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:52,239
clear initially but the benefit of being

2754
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:53,840
less clear

2755
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,600
and this actually ties in a bit with

2756
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,280
some of the infusion space work that

2757
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,760
i've been working on is it makes it more

2758
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,560
nascent it um whilst with active

2759
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,239
inference it gives that holding

2760
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,480
container so by being more nascent

2761
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,639
you've got more ability to then proceed

2762
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,600
again with another type of naturalistic

2763
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,159
potentially more naturalistic framework

2764
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,080
and not being tied to a naturalistic

2765
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,280
framework

2766
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,360
based on language and all the

2767
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,760
distortions that can come from that so i

2768
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,400
think that that's a really big part of

2769
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,280
what makes it useful

2770
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,920
oh sorry

2771
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,840
no thanks um

2772
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,880
these are all super good points um and i

2773
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,199
agree uh completely

2774
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,800
and i think that this

2775
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,440
is also recognized in um

2776
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,040
in psychology that there is a tendency

2777
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:47,280
to attribute all kinds of uh terms to uh

2778
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,480
different brain areas for example um

2779
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,080
like the

2780
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,760
prefrontal cortex there are more

2781
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,280
functions assigned to that it could

2782
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,520
possibly hold for example you could find

2783
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,719
papers that

2784
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,000
identify the location of um stock

2785
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
trading behavior

2786
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,920
and these are clearly human invented

2787
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,199
terms and

2788
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,880
there is no reason why they should have

2789
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,760
um an expression in the in the brain

2790
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,560
um and so um

2791
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,560
i think uh

2792
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,040
a nicer way of thinking about this and

2793
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,679
um i think you mentioned it before is uh

2794
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:22,960
this

2795
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,679
dynamic between segregation and

2796
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:27,520
integration so sometimes it makes sense

2797
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,320
to

2798
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,920
be focused on a particular task everyone

2799
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,679
let's say uh

2800
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:34,880
you know

2801
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,800
without in

2802
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,600
lots of distractions you you are very

2803
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,600
efficient at performing one particular

2804
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,480
task

2805
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,320
um but that might not be the most

2806
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,840
creative

2807
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,560
mode of operation um

2808
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,760
where you might rather want to have lots

2809
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,760
of different brain regions

2810
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,520
simultaneously interacting with each

2811
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,159
other and exchanging lots of information

2812
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:01,520
that's not efficient but it's very

2813
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:02,800
integrative

2814
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,840
so um neither of those extremes is

2815
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,280
probably viable by themselves but if you

2816
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,560
have a good

2817
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,360
flexible way of moving between

2818
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,760
segregation and integration you can be

2819
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,800
very much task oriented specific but you

2820
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,719
can also be creative

2821
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,080
and incorporate lots of different

2822
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,559
information

2823
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:27,119
awesome daniel

2824
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,400
it's a good point marco and also that

2825
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,280
meta task of appropriately choosing how

2826
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,520
to shift tax tasks

2827
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,719
is framed as a type of mental action

2828
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,639
in the nested active inference the deep

2829
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,880
active inference formalism

2830
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,760
so we can actually think about that

2831
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,960
shifting

2832
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,400
between different

2833
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,440
affordances at the attentional level

2834
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,119
as another kind of action selection task

2835
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,719
that uses this same perception cognition

2836
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:01,760
and action framework so and i agree as

2837
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,840
well stephen it does

2838
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,679
start with a more

2839
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:07,760
atomic germ

2840
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,280
it's more nascent

2841
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,920
and that's what allows us to to map and

2842
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,080
bridge and compose

2843
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,960
if we try to put too much meaning

2844
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,880
into the lowest level

2845
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,080
we actually constrain how tall the

2846
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,480
buildings that we can build are

2847
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,719
and douglas hofstetter talks about this

2848
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,520
in the context of reflexive computer

2849
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,560
systems

2850
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,960
brains and ant colonies

2851
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,080
just today as it was in 1979 three of

2852
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,560
the most important systems to understand

2853
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,600
and gets at in all of those systems how

2854
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,199
the lowest level

2855
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,679
like the interactions among nest mates

2856
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:49,119
themselves or the letters they cannot

2857
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,520
have meaning in the way that for example

2858
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,639
words do

2859
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,639
because if you load all the meaning of

2860
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,800
words onto phonemes

2861
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,280
you can't compose sentences

2862
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,600
and it's just it's very interesting how

2863
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,280
even though of course we want that

2864
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:04,400
meaning

2865
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,800
we have to actually take a dip into

2866
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,840
using

2867
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,400
pieces that are sub meaningful

2868
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,920
in order to have flexible meaning

2869
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,920
because if you just try to run straight

2870
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,760
for the meaning you're going to end up

2871
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,080
with a very constrained system that

2872
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,080
might have the one function or meaning

2873
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,159
that you want to encode but it won't

2874
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,159
have the ability to reflect or to

2875
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,879
generate novel meaning

2876
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,440
nice

2877
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,639
so just in the last few minutes um i

2878
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,560
just want to thank daniel for taking the

2879
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,320
time out to discuss his awesome paper

2880
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,760
with us which i've been really wanting

2881
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,480
to discuss for several months um and

2882
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,080
hopefully he'll be back next week with

2883
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,719
more conversations about active infrared

2884
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,199
um and marco welcome it was really nice

2885
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,600
to have you here uh and so just if

2886
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,080
anybody wants to give a final thought on

2887
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,239
this paper or some stuff that they're

2888
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,839
excited to talk about next week

2889
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,119
well thanks a lot this was really

2890
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:06,400
awesome

2891
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,560
and i learned a lot there are also lots

2892
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,000
of references i think that i need to

2893
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,040
check out now that you mentioned

2894
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,159
um and yeah really thanks a lot for for

2895
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:20,239
the paper and for presenting today

2896
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,400
yeah just to mirror what marco says and

2897
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,400
also welcome marco thanks for joining us

2898
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,599
um

2899
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:30,400
really really enjoyed the the different

2900
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,599
avenues

2901
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,679
and actually the ability for it to

2902
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:35,840
keep coming back to something which

2903
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,920
could hold those different

2904
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,119
um

2905
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,440
branches which is quite nice so

2906
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,480
we saw an ability to come back to

2907
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,960
and reintegrate a lot of different ideas

2908
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,119
so that was really nice so let's look

2909
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:52,320
forward to keeping that going

2910
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,199
cool daniel

2911
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,599
well thanks everyone for joining and

2912
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,840
blue for excellent facilitator and

2913
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,920
broadcaster role

2914
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,440
i think for 29.2 what might be awesome

2915
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,000
other than having some novel nest mates

2916
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,560
on the stream and in the live chat

2917
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,280
what might be cool would be like to lay

2918
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,199
out some of these analogies that we've

2919
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,000
been exploring like okay agent and

2920
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,639
environment all right that's nest mate

2921
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:22,639
and pheromone density there's like the

2922
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,320
environment that you can control and

2923
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,080
then there's sort of the abiotic

2924
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,440
environment or there's the parts of the

2925
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,360
environment that are outside of the

2926
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,520
affordance of niche modification like

2927
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,320
the thunderstorm okay so maybe having

2928
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,000
that kind of a table would help us align

2929
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,320
a lot of the systems that we've been

2930
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:44,800
talking about so ants computers brains

2931
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,560
societies

2932
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,040
other systems that people care about

2933
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,280
that's kind of like us

2934
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,080
preemptively foraging maybe laying down

2935
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,880
the inkling of some trails because just

2936
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,520
like a few years ago when i was deep in

2937
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,199
the ant game

2938
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,520
seeing that there was a way to bridge

2939
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,920
active inference and ant research in

2940
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,679
potentially a new way

2941
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,280
maybe someone's going to go oh i mean

2942
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,920
architecture i do that every day and

2943
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,320
i've been looking for a way to inroad

2944
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,960
active inference or another

2945
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,440
another way that maybe we could help

2946
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,400
scaffold

2947
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,040
somebody else's research because i think

2948
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,199
the stigmatic modeling and a lot of

2949
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:27,520
these discussions

2950
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,520
go to a lot of systems and things that

2951
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,760
people are already working on so that

2952
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,480
would be awesome to talk about in 29.2

2953
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:38,159
and to build momentum going forward

2954
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,679
awesome well thank you again everyone

2955
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,920
and we were are looking forward to our

2956
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,920
discussion next week so get in touch if

2957
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,080
you are watching on the live stream and

2958
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,960
want to participate

2959
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,440
bye
