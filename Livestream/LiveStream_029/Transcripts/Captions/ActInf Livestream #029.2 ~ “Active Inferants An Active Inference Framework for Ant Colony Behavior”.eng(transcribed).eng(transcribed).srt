00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,920
welcome to the active inference lab live

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,559
stream number

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,200
29.2

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,480
today is september 28

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,039
2021 and we will be discussing the paper

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
active in france

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
an active inference framework for ant

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
colony behavior and today we are here

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
with the first author daniel friedman

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
the active inference lab is the

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
participatory online lab that is

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
communicating learning and practicing

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
applied active inference you can find us

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
at all of the links shown here

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
this is a recorded and an archive live

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,719
feedback so that we can

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,320
improve upon our work

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
welcome here and we will be following

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,280
good video etiquette for live streams

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
here at the short link you can find all

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,559
of the upcoming and recent live streams

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
that we have done so please get in touch

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
if you would like to participate

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
today our goal is to discuss the paper

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
um that we just said active in france

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,880
and we are going to um

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
do some different papers in the upcoming

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
weeks like i said get in touch if you

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
want to participate

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,560
so

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
we're just going to introduce ourselves

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
and go through a little bit of warming

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
up i am blue knight i'm an independent

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
research consultant from new mexico and

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
i'll pass it to

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,880
thanks blue for facilitating i'm daniel

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,920
and i'm a researcher in california

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
and i guess i'll

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
start with what i'm excited about today

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,119
i was just excited that in 2091 we could

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,840
sort of forage out in a lot of different

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
directions and make some initial trails

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
to a few different ideas

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,200
and then now in the 29.2

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
maybe we can develop some of those

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,080
threads splash trails and maybe uh get

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
some of it down in writing so it should

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
look um

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
pretty good

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
nice yeah i'm excited too um there are

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
some questions that i've been rolling

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
over over the last week

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
and so i'm kind of excited to

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
delve into those and also into the code

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
for the model today if we have time um

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
being that it's just us i think we might

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
get there well maybe though maybe more

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
people will join

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
there might be a little bit of lag

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
i'm not sure

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
so you might want to check that

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
okay

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
yeah

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
um

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
i don't know if it's my internet

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
um

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
so the big question of this paper is um

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
how can a group of active inference

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,879
agents

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,440
solve complex group foraging problems

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
well first what i'll say is if you're

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
recording it locally as well as

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
streaming then

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
we can always upload a high quality

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
recording

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
and it does sort of bear on this big

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
question this is a quote from the paper

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,920
and that's sort of the big question in

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,040
collective behavioral studies which is

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
okay if greeting stephen if each agent

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
if each subunit of the system had all

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
the information needed well then there

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
wouldn't necessarily be a challenge for

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
coordination it's like if if it already

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
knew what to do then

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,239
it would be a challenge but how do

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
systems make adaptive decisions when

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
subunits don't have all the information

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
so in the case of an online team each

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
person's only seeing a different

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,599
part of the picture in the case the ants

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,720
they're each in a little bit different

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
part of their niche but those are some

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
of the similarities which is that each

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
nest mate is only going to be

98
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,439
experiencing its local environment

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,640
and

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
we want to have colonies that work

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
so welcome stephen maybe you can say

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
hello while blue's just testing some

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
stuff out

104
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,120
oh great yeah good morning um

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,799
well in north america anyway um yeah i'm

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
based in toronto um

107
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,720
and i

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,839
work with communities and

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,199
sort of systemic coaching approaches and

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,960
very interested in how active influence

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
scales in different ways so

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
even though this is about small things

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
it's also about lots of small things

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
so

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
well your audio also just had some

116
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
weirdness steve maybe talk directly into

117
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,000
it

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,960
oh okay is that better yeah

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
oh okay but you mentioned the scaling

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
and small the one one funny thought

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
again this picture is from the ants

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
that i was studying for five years in

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
arizona

124
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
and

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
um yes the nest mate looks

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,039
like a tiny guy like a small ant

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,000
but then

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
we know that these colonies can live for

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
20 30 plus years

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
they're also several meters

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
under the ground

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
and they weigh you know dozens of

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720
kilograms so then i'm thinking okay it's

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
a similar age

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
weight and height to myself

136
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
and it's sub-use but

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
let's see how's that is it any better

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
it still is not doing anything i just

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
reopened it but if it's not yeah then i

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,199
guess okay now it's uh just the slides

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
or just a jitsi so it looks like it's

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
working now okay perfect yeah it's the

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
slides open also it just is too much um

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,400
yeah

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
yeah welcome back everybody fun times

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,199
the show goes on

147
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,520
foraging never stops so it does and

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
steven will rejoin us hopefully he's

149
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
having audio issues also it's a good day

150
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
for technical uh mishaps we're having

151
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
rainy weather in new mexico which is

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
never ever happens so all the ants are

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
underground hiding and the internet does

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
not want to cooperate

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
apparently this is so

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
all right so speaking of multi-scale uh

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
integration and and across systems as

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,639
happens in ants and in the ant colony um

159
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,199
so we we talked about making this table

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,039
last time

161
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,440
and so here like what how is each system

162
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
related to

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
the agent the niche the interaction and

164
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
stigma v

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
so we started this this table do you

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
want to uh maybe take us through what

167
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
you've started here daniel

168
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
yeah um

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
see if you can

170
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
[Music]

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,759
get the slides again because it's not

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
going to be visible at all on the stream

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
oh okay i can also switch yeah i can

174
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
switch the also yeah

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
um so

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
a lot of informal analogies and

177
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
connections were being drawn amongst

178
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
different systems

179
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
and that's kind of what complexity and

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
systems thinking and active inference is

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
about like finding patterns across

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,919
systems so

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
maybe there's other ways to break it up

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,199
but at least one way we could at least

185
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
start to classify

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
and find similarities and differences

187
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,759
between different systems would be

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
this way with the columns so we have the

189
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,479
system of interest like the ant colony

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
as a system of interest

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,240
then we can think about what is the

192
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,440
agent level what is the sub unit level

193
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,400
and

194
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
that might be the level where the active

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
inference agent is being specified

196
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,319
we then have the niche that the agent is

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,720
operating in so that's the generative

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
process

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
that's presenting observations or

200
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,199
outcomes to

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
the agent which is embodying a

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,199
generative model so that's related to

203
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,199
this generative process versus

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
generative model distinction

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
the process is the

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
the process actually outputs

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
the like temperature or the observations

208
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
whereas the generative model is a model

209
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
of the process

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,759
and then there's two kinds of

211
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
interactions that are possible

212
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,319
so there's sort of a transient

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
interaction

214
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
that might be amongst agents welcome

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
back stephen there's the transient

216
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
interactions amongst agents

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
and in the case of the ants that's like

218
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
an antennal contact and then there's the

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,039
stigmatic

220
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,560
interactions

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
where there's a modification of the

222
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,519
niche

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,479
and so

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
sometimes it helps to think about these

225
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,279
interactions amongst agents that

226
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
are um without memory as being like the

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,279
transient horizontal interactions like

228
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
the common example of the bird flock

229
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
those are the birds looking at each

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
other their interactions amongst agents

231
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
that modify the likelihood of agents

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
doing certain future behaviors but they

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
don't leave a trace on the environment

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
and that can be contrasted with

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,160
stigmatic

236
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
or niche modification behaviors which

237
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
are defined by being the ones that do

238
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
leave a trace on the environment so

239
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,680
maybe we'll

240
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
explore different sections today

241
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
but we can always say okay let's return

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
to slide eight and let's add a row

243
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
what's a system of interest let's add a

244
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,160
column or let's fill in some columns so

245
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
so far we have ant colony brain and

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,320
internet slash computer abcs

247
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
geb the systems that matter um steven

248
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,800
what what would be um a fun system to

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
throw into this mix and to look for

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,600
parallelisms among

251
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
we can't hear you steven

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
yeah we still don't hear you steven

253
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
yeah your microphone's definitely not

254
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
working

255
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
okay

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
so i've started filling in for for brain

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
and you know it all really is so

258
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,760
dependent on what the

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
what level you want to evaluate right so

260
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
you know on one level there's like the

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,800
little sub regions of the brain and you

262
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
took us through i think in the dog zero

263
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
video a very nice um

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
example for ants that has been kind of

265
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
done describing the different like

266
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
organoids or substructures within the

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
brain because definitely there are

268
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
structures that all have

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
different functions like the cerebellum

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
is motor function primarily and you know

271
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
the cortex is like higher level thought

272
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
and and so there's you know these

273
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,560
different sub regions of the brain but

274
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,959
then also at the cellular level there

275
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,680
are interactions you know that that

276
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,480
expand those regions that are from you

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
know the cellular cellular level um

278
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
and what is the so what the niches or

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
the interaction

280
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
um you know might might be different

281
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
depending on like the the cells are

282
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
responsible for driving the interactions

283
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
between the organoids

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,079
so i'm not sure what the level of um

285
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
of

286
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,880
the level of analysis the right one is

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
and then stigmatizing modification i

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
think about you know long-term

289
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
potentiation

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
um and like adaptation within the brain

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
is very um

292
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,040
maybe not stigmatic but it's a it's a

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
really important modification i think

294
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,120
um and sensitivity to different

295
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
neurotransmitters and

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
things like that

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
blue it's still really lagging can you

298
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
just stop streaming and i'm gonna pick

299
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,120
it up on my side okay perfect go for it

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
so stop the streaming and then just let

301
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,839
me know when you did it let's see how

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,959
this

303
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
okay let's see what happens

304
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,760
this could be very very interesting

305
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
to do the live hack like this

306
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
okay youtube we're gonna wait for it to

307
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
catch up sorry everybody um

308
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
so it goes okay

309
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
wow we just hot swapped

310
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
live stream feeds

311
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
so we're back in the game

312
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
no level of preparation that can prepare

313
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,040
for laggy internet i suppose no and it's

314
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
like half the time of mine and a half a

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
time on your side but um

316
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,279
if you're watching live definitely add

317
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,560
any comments or questions because we're

318
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
just going to be kind of exploring and

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
chilling today

320
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
but continue to um facilitate and i'll

321
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,680
just be broadcaster role

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
cool so the um

323
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
[Music]

324
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
yeah we were talking about the brain and

325
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,320
the interaction and the sigmoidy and

326
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
then for the internet

327
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
i don't know what do you think is the

328
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
is the agent or what what is the sub

329
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,519
unit of the internet like is it each

330
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,600
server or

331
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
where do you have the sub unit at

332
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,239
daniel or stephen what do you guys think

333
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
well so this this sort of ties into what

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,519
they might say in in research you know

335
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
unit of analysis as well but that's not

336
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
necessarily quite the same

337
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
thing as an agent um

338
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
i i suppose on the internet

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ultimately

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,959
it's the um

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
it's it's whoever's um

342
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
making

343
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
who's that whoever's triggering choices

344
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,959
um

345
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,800
in the system

346
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
um which is normally a yeah it's

347
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
normally a person

348
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,360
um

349
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,560
interacting with the screen in some way

350
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,199
i think the overwhelming amount of

351
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
interactions on the internet are

352
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
probably not human driven

353
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
because any human

354
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
interaction

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,839
is going to

356
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,680
trigger truly a vast number of

357
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
communications

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
amongst other systems

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
inside of the computer and probably

360
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,959
remotely

361
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
so maybe

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
and i think this is one of the unique

363
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
uh challenges but also interesting areas

364
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
is like

365
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
the internet is a cyber physical system

366
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
so we could have one model where the

367
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
agent like the subunit are physical

368
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,959
devices so we kind of draw

369
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
the blanket

370
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,760
we um

371
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
focus on the partitioning

372
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,920
around a physical object like internet

373
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
of things we have partitionings around

374
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
things

375
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
we could also have a human-centered

376
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
partitioning so partitioning around

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,079
humans but then there's a lot of

378
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
gray space in between the humans

379
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
a lot of links that aren't human between

380
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
the human links

381
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
and then another approach might be

382
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
purely informational or computational

383
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
and seeing the agents as software agents

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
but i think that

385
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
interface where how will we talk about

386
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
the

387
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
software and the hardware agents coming

388
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
together is where

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
the internet of things is

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,079
developing and what it's coming to mean

391
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,000
i mean one thing you could think about

392
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
there also is when say for instance i

393
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
make a choice or i do something

394
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
on the internet

395
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
and there's a whole load of there's a

396
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
cascade of other things going on through

397
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
the different routers and the servers

398
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
etc is that more like the pheromone

399
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
trail

400
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,680
that sort of dissipates off into the

401
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
distance leaving records

402
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
and how much of its like other agents

403
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,920
initiating because often

404
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
you know

405
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
every time you do something to some

406
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,120
extent yeah databases might update

407
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,360
um

408
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
however

409
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
and this may change

410
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,519
to what extent

411
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
that is alive is another question

412
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
you know is it is is it sort of a

413
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
computational form of niche modification

414
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
that's going on in most cases in terms

415
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,839
of the internet

416
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,079
but what they're trying to do because

417
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,600
it's that idea of the battle for your

418
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,279
mind they're trying to make it so that

419
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,040
in most cases that

420
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
the user

421
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,160
has less

422
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
has less thinking to do

423
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
in terms of the choices they make

424
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
and the design there's this there's a

425
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
great book in web design called don't

426
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
make me think

427
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
and the idea is that you go somewhere

428
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
it's almost obvious what you need to do

429
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,959
a bit like when you pick up a newspaper

430
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,000
you know that you're just going to turn

431
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
the pages

432
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,040
so

433
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
how

434
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
how much of all this

435
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
architecture in the background is to

436
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
support giving you what you expect to be

437
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
given when you expect to be given it

438
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,240
um and how much of it is um

439
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,079
which you know how much of it is

440
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,079
actually um what you might term an agent

441
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,959
with with some sort of

442
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,758
teleology

443
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,800
well

444
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
you mentioned expectation there and um

445
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
expectation is something that agents

446
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
engage in so maybe it's even we could

447
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
keep on forking this off but

448
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,679
what do we know from the active

449
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,720
inference ontology what defines an agent

450
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,599
external states blanket states internal

451
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,760
generative model what does the internal

452
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,359
generative model entail well it includes

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,520
predictions about external states it

454
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
includes policy affordances it includes

455
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
preferences and includes expectations

456
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
over some of these things as well

457
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
so when we say agents

458
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
we can be

459
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
referring to the whole markov decision

460
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,400
process or other ways of viewing the

461
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
active agents

462
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
and then the expectations of the agent

463
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
are really important because it's not

464
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
just that psychologically it's going to

465
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,520
determine whether the agent

466
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,559
likes it or not but it helps us connect

467
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,679
these systems like the ant colony and

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
subunits of the brain

469
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
so we don't need to use only the

470
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
psychological interpretation

471
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
but then we can have a psychological

472
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,240
interpretation where one seems warranted

473
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
given the system of interest but also

474
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
we're going to be able to compare that

475
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
and look for similar functional features

476
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
in systems without getting into just

477
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
some sort of abstract debate over

478
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
whether it's alive or whether it's

479
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,080
certain feels a certain way to be that

480
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
system

481
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
so daniel you brought up the generative

482
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
model and i was just going to bring it

483
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
up um right before this and so i've been

484
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,799
really uh

485
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,160
you know thinking a lot about the

486
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
generative model and like where is the

487
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,960
generative model which is like i think

488
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
probably my favorite podcast episode

489
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
that i've ever cut is going to come out

490
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
next week

491
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
and it talks about like the location of

492
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
the generative model and so

493
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
you know it doesn't necessarily have to

494
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
have a location

495
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,000
because

496
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
it's like software right like so i mean

497
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
that yeah there's like a copy of the

498
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,640
software running on disk

499
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,720
maybe maybe it's in the cloud like it

500
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
does but it doesn't matter because it's

501
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,160
the program that's running so the

502
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
location of the program is is almost not

503
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
even relevant

504
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
um so i just i think about like what is

505
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,480
the generative model

506
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
of the internet right like what does

507
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,039
that look like

508
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
great question um inactivism for cyber

509
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,440
physical systems

510
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
and embodiment

511
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
uh in encodement maybe there's some

512
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,919
analogous term

513
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
to what would describe

514
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,080
what we call 4e in the embodied extended

515
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,440
and cultured

516
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,039
etc

517
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
for digital systems

518
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
because they do have

519
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
important attributes

520
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
that

521
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
in a strange way almost suggest that

522
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,760
some of these attributes some of these

523
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
features that are suggested to be

524
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
quintessentially related to having a

525
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,799
body and embodiment

526
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
also exist for software

527
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,679
could i putting something on to that

528
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,159
is say we think about rather than and

529
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
you've got the active inference

530
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,440
generative model

531
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,280
but say you've got an active niche

532
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
modification

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
algorithm

534
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
so ie

535
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
it's still

536
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,720
working

537
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
off the agents being making choices but

538
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,159
what's happening is so for instance say

539
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,480
you've got abc testing happening on a

540
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,159
website so basically they send out three

541
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,600
different campaigns with three different

542
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
types of

543
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,159
profiles

544
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
now the user makes choices

545
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
based on how the user

546
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,679
makes a choice

547
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,080
they may be

548
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
across the whole of the

549
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
a whole market

550
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,440
the abc choices might get modified in

551
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,880
that niche but eventually maybe then

552
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
actual

553
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
clients get sent down certain routes

554
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
um i mean a classic case of this is also

555
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,559
what happens with those in-store cards

556
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
because i actually i ended up going i

557
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
didn't get go for it again i had an

558
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,600
interview with the nectar card people in

559
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
the uk once and they uh

560
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
they do these cards that you get in

561
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,159
store and basically i think it worked

562
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,360
out they have like a million

563
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
permutations of offer that they can give

564
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
you based on what your

565
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
different buy-in options are so in a way

566
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,919
they're kind of

567
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,679
that but they only serve you up then

568
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
whatever you see one of those right you

569
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
don't see what all the other people are

570
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,799
getting and some of them are small

571
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,080
changes some of them might be bigger

572
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,960
changes so in some ways it's like it's

573
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,039
still the it's still like it's like the

574
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
niche is modifying

575
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
to the agent's adaptive behavior

576
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,679
but the actual niche isn't necessarily

577
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,159
doing adaptive active inference but

578
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
there may be some sort of active

579
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
inference in a more kind of

580
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
i don't know non-living way

581
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,960
um

582
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
there might be um we'll probably have

583
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
better words and ontologically informed

584
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,159
ways of talking about it but there's

585
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,360
kind of like low bar active inference or

586
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
like austere active inference that is

587
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,799
just any input output structure

588
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,799
it's going to be able to be fit into

589
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,240
something like

590
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
a partially observable markov decision

591
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
process so whatever it is that the niche

592
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
is doing it's emitting

593
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,520
observations so we can model it under

594
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,919
this certain low bar active inference

595
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,559
versus the uh sort of

596
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
anti-dissipative

597
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,559
truly cognitive

598
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,120
strategic active inference

599
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
and um

600
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
also there's no reason why we can't have

601
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,440
hybrid models where there's like active

602
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
inference agents

603
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,600
in a niche that isn't an active

604
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,679
inference agent so like in

605
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,360
this ant model

606
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,600
the niche is just

607
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,240
a landscape of pheromone densities with

608
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,039
a random dissipation factor

609
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,760
so

610
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
that

611
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
external niche

612
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,640
could be made very

613
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
um much more complicated

614
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
and the observations that it passes back

615
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
to the agents could be like customized

616
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
to them

617
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,760
and that could be

618
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
calculated by an active inference niche

619
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,039
or not and that's sort of the extremely

620
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,480
interesting

621
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,200
work of axel constant and others

622
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,080
with

623
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,799
some type of symmetry occurring with the

624
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,640
agent and the niche jointly inferring

625
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
each other so like what is the niche's

626
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,559
generative model of the organism what is

627
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,720
the internet's generative model

628
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,679
of the user so it's

629
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
interesting questions

630
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
i love that idea of

631
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
symmetry especially between the agent

632
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,760
and the niche um and its relationship or

633
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
potential relationship to the kind of

634
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
gaia theory

635
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
that the the niche has to

636
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
expect or have an expectation of the

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
organism that's going to

638
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
interact with it or create it or modify

639
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
it or

640
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,799
exploit it in some way um in order for

641
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
there to be some kind of reciprocal

642
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,360
um interaction there

643
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
so uh super nice

644
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,799
um maybe

645
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,799
we can come back to looking at this um

646
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,880
table and maybe think of other systems

647
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
that might be

648
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
interesting to go through

649
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
and move on to

650
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,159
some of the um

651
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,520
questions

652
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,679
for

653
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,600
29.2 but wait before we go to this one i

654
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
want to go to this one hold on

655
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
ha

656
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,039
so we were talking about um

657
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,240
the role of dopamine last time which

658
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,279
slide

659
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,840
uh so sorry this is slide

660
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,640
um i skip to

661
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
i'm sorry i can't see

662
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
um

663
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,559
i think it's number seven

664
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,279
yeah number number eleven

665
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,600
oh wait okay

666
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
so um

667
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,720
so we were talking about last time the

668
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
role of dopamine

669
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
and like influencing the affordances and

670
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
and this really kind of speaks to the

671
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
role of reward

672
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,159
um

673
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,559
in a generative model and and so you

674
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,320
know we talk about one of the beautiful

675
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,159
things about active inference is it kind

676
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,880
of

677
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,679
changes the reward um structure

678
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,039
in the model

679
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,880
because you know there's some kind of

680
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
reward that's given

681
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
to

682
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
you know actually finding the food right

683
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,840
so so there's some some reward for

684
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
finding the food but also and and even

685
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
in this model so

686
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,559
the the reward structures has changed

687
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
right so there's um it's not just about

688
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
finding the food um and maybe this is a

689
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
good opportunity to to look through the

690
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
code maybe

691
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,200
as well but but you know we think about

692
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
the change in the reward structure and

693
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,279
we place some value on the epistemic um

694
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
you know the knowledge about the model

695
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
of the world so if we can build a more

696
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
precise model of the world

697
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
we can also um

698
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
gain more food overall

699
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
so i don't know if uh you guys have

700
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,559
comments on that or yes steven guide

701
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,279
yeah i think also as well as built like

702
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
you say building that model of the world

703
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,720
becomes a it's an action model okay so

704
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
it can be

705
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
what might be seen factually

706
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,720
spurious but practically useful

707
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
you know so it may be really useful to

708
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,640
have some bizarre

709
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
ritual about how to get on a soccer

710
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,840
pitch and try and kick the ball right

711
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,440
but if it

712
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
does something better than

713
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
what you're doing otherwise

714
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,678
go for it

715
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,320
and i think the challenge comes with um

716
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,279
increasingly esoteric rituals if they're

717
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,960
not related to the actual causal

718
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
structure of the world

719
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,799
if they work for a moment they're not

720
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,640
going to be adaptive because if your

721
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
only strategy is you know

722
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,200
praying to the kicking god instead of

723
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,039
practicing

724
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,120
it might work or it might indirectly

725
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
induce some sort of outcome but

726
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
is that a long-term strategy

727
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,919
um but

728
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
agree that the generative model is

729
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
including a model of action it's not

730
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,679
just about getting precision about how

731
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,279
things are out there

732
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
because what ultimately matters is

733
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
getting precision on our actions

734
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,000
and then there's sort of these two

735
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,640
parallel paths or two intertwining paths

736
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
which is do we take a reward centered

737
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,960
approach

738
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,760
is behavior dominated by reward

739
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,039
and then the other side of the reward

740
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,760
coin is like the um punishment aversion

741
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
so carrot in the stick that's sort of a

742
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,399
sister road two-lane road do we pursue

743
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,039
reward or do we avoid

744
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,200
regret and suffering

745
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,279
and then a third road is this

746
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,159
uncertainty minimization approach

747
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,159
so i pasted in this

748
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,559
paper by columbo explanatory pluralism

749
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
and um

750
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,000
they review

751
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
three prominent hypotheses of dopamine

752
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,960
activity so anhedonia which is

753
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,120
unpleasurable states incentive salience

754
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,279
and reward prediction errors

755
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
and i i think this is a really

756
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
fascinating paper and it does apply to

757
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,120
the ant context because they make a very

758
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,320
specific

759
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,159
system point

760
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,399
talking about the role of dopamine in

761
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
the mammalian brain reviewing empirical

762
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
evidence and then also

763
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
pull back to the broader implications

764
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,799
for the philosophy of science

765
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,679
so

766
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
they conclude that the evidence

767
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
currently vindicates explanatory

768
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
pluralism in other words these

769
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,919
explanations do not subsume

770
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
or

771
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
knock out each other there's a pluralism

772
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,960
there's

773
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
multiple explanations that exist that

774
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,399
capture different parts of how the

775
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,640
system really works

776
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
the vindication implies that grand

777
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,559
unified incl uh claims

778
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,559
of the advocates of the ptb are

779
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,760
unwarranted

780
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,640
um

781
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
look at what that is again but more

782
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,000
generally we suggest that the form of

783
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,840
scientific progress in the cognitive

784
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,880
sciences

785
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,200
is unlikely to be a single overarching

786
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
grand unified theory

787
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,399
little possible indirect

788
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,440
reference to those who claim that the

789
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
value or the utility of for example the

790
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
free energy principle or active

791
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
inference is just simply that it

792
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,840
explains everything i don't need to even

793
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,000
say any more or detail where i used it

794
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
or show you the code or show you that

795
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,080
it's better than another model the fact

796
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
that this model

797
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,080
i can fit everything into

798
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,520
is the utility and it will subsume other

799
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,679
models and other frameworks

800
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,600
now that's a contentious point that has

801
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,679
to be either empirically supported or

802
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,399
not but it just is so interesting how

803
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
dopamine is reward molecule or the other

804
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
side of that coin with the punishment

805
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
or as a precision molecule the empirical

806
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,159
evidence alone

807
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,679
are not enough to disambiguate that and

808
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
so you know trust the data let the data

809
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
speak but then this is just showing us a

810
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,679
kind of real time

811
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
that our models of the world

812
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
get projected as we do sense making on

813
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
the experimental outcomes

814
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,480
and um it's not always as clear as it

815
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,000
seems

816
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,360
well you know it just reminds me like so

817
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
i mean

818
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
just from a very literal sense if we

819
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,520
think about dopamine as um

820
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,559
a reward for minimizing prediction error

821
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,360
like how much do we all like to be right

822
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,679
all of us so i mean like just just for

823
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,720
being correct like that in and of itself

824
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,520
is a huge like dopamine reward and i

825
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
think about like i'm a super ultra nerd

826
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,520
and so i geek out on things like

827
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
difficult math problems or solving a

828
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
rubik's cube or or these kinds of things

829
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,240
and i'm just like finally when i get or

830
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
even code right like finally when the

831
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
code runs

832
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,880
there's like this huge like something

833
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
that you've been working on for a really

834
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
long time it's like a huge like dopamine

835
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,399
rush for me which is why like i keep

836
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
going back to doing these kinds of

837
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,320
things but but ultimately that's a

838
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,720
prediction error reward

839
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
so it's interesting to think about

840
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,519
and here's sort of the two ways that

841
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
they're phrased and it's

842
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,120
somewhat subtle but i think it gets at

843
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,880
the difference between reinforcement

844
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,120
learning and active inference

845
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,640
is there a drive for being right

846
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,679
and then we prefer to be certain

847
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,679
or is the drive

848
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
for certainty and then there's a

849
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,919
preference over being right or being

850
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,840
accurate

851
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,159
so are there situations where it

852
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,960
actually brings us solace

853
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,440
even though the direction of the outcome

854
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
isn't what we expected

855
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
or isn't what on some sense conversation

856
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,279
is what we prefer

857
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
but actually the fact that we're able to

858
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,279
have certainty

859
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,480
outweighs

860
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,080
the fact that the outcome went the way

861
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,360
it went

862
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,440
so and maybe there's other phrasings too

863
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,120
but it's just again which one do we put

864
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
in the driver's seat precision or reward

865
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
well so what's the difference between

866
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,159
being certain and being correct like

867
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
being right and being certain

868
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,320
like okay if i'm really certain but then

869
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
that that certainty is unwarranted

870
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,679
then that's when i'm wrong but then i'll

871
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,000
i have this prediction error gap right

872
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
so either way so what's the difference

873
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
really between being certain and being

874
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,760
correct

875
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
well i think one if i could just jump in

876
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,559
there i think one thing is really

877
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
interesting is if everything's based on

878
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,120
energy minimization like you've got

879
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
you've got a process you're going to

880
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
keep doing it and it's optimizing to

881
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,039
make it basically if i use less energy

882
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,559
i'm being more efficient i'm being

883
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,039
faster i've been smoother so it always

884
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
seems like yeah go for the reward the

885
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,720
thing is though

886
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
once you get into something where it's

887
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,840
more

888
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,720
complex or uncertain

889
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
um

890
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,679
you know the idea and they talk about

891
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,120
this now actually there's a whole area

892
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
in um

893
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,559
development work and design thinking

894
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,600
called failing forward fail forward so

895
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,919
the idea is fail fast fail quick but

896
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,600
part of this is like

897
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,399
in

898
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,880
you know and i always say within ethical

899
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
bounds right because it might be great

900
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,760
for the designer as long as it's not a

901
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,559
community member being sort of

902
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,880
being frustrated by this but but it

903
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
makes sense in the sense that and i

904
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,919
don't think reinforcement learning can

905
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,960
really account for this is the benefit

906
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
of doing something

907
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,279
because it might be something which

908
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,640
doesn't work

909
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
but now you can take from it it's almost

910
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
like

911
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,960
you're

912
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
giving yourself

913
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
a sample of the counter factuals

914
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
in a way by something going wrong but

915
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,159
you don't obviously we can then break it

916
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,519
apart and say well there might be

917
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,679
something right still in that

918
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,519
you know and some bits which are more

919
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,600
wrong and we can sort of

920
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,039
do stuff with that information

921
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,879
almost like succeeding forward would be

922
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
better than failing forward i mean

923
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,879
failing forward has this psychological

924
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,800
benefit of helping people recognize that

925
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,560
it's okay to not get it right the first

926
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
time and just get something on the paper

927
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,879
and we'll iterate from there so the

928
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,960
rhetoric of fail forward

929
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
makes sense but

930
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
having something that's even positive

931
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
like succeed forward or win forward or

932
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,639
contribute forward or learn forward or

933
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
develop forward those actually capture

934
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,320
the functional spirit that um

935
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
is here and let's think about how that

936
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,879
relates to blue's question so what's the

937
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
difference between being certain and

938
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,760
correct

939
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,000
so there could probably be many takes on

940
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,359
this but

941
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,679
i thought of this classic

942
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,599
science textbook

943
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,800
you know when when they give you the

944
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
science textbook um

945
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,520
the difference between accuracy and

946
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,400
precision now in many cases now this

947
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,599
also is not coming from the active

948
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,160
inference ontology so they may be using

949
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
these terms in a slightly different way

950
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,839
but the point is we're getting at two

951
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,119
complementary components of precision

952
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,240
and um

953
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
basically

954
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
uh we can see that there's these two off

955
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
diagonals the top left and the bottom

956
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,480
right so high accuracy high precision

957
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
it's like your average is on target

958
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
so that's the accuracy

959
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
is where you're aiming at accuracy aim

960
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
and then the precision is referring to

961
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,839
the tightness of the distribution around

962
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,440
that mean

963
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
and so you could have high accuracy like

964
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
it's always at the bullseye but the

965
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
precision is low or the uncertainty the

966
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
spread is high

967
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
you could also have like a thermometer

968
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
with it giving you very tight readings

969
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
high precision

970
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
but

971
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
it's

972
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,640
systematically biased in a certain

973
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,079
direction

974
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,580
and

975
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,680
[Music]

976
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
this is just one way to get at two

977
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,520
different aspects now we've seen this in

978
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
a few different cases in variational

979
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,560
inference as being the um difference

980
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,880
between the expectations

981
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,359
the means of the distributions

982
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,760
that's like the accuracy

983
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
and then the precision is like the

984
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,920
variance of that distribution

985
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,520
so you could have a very tight

986
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,040
distribution

987
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,400
um the the q distribution very tight and

988
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
close to the p distribution that would

989
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,119
be accurate and precise you could also

990
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
have a really over fit over confident

991
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
model that is just simply quite

992
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,079
divergent from the underlying p

993
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
distribution

994
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,040
so um which one is being optimized are

995
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
we trying to aim for a tight scatter

996
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
and then we and then second order is we

997
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
want it to be in the middle or do we aim

998
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,320
for the middle and then the second order

999
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
is we want them to be accurate

1000
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
stephen

1001
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,119
yeah that that

1002
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,240
to that question is a good one um

1003
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,000
and i think distinguish because often

1004
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
they might get conflated in many ways

1005
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
but it's good to pull apart precision

1006
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
and accuracy because it is a

1007
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,240
you know you could have

1008
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
um you know you you could be very

1009
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,280
precise in the fuzzy set that you have

1010
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,040
and you could but it could still be

1011
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
fuzzy you could have something

1012
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,040
like you say more accurate but it moves

1013
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,160
around a lot and i think that

1014
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
that's that's an important distinction

1015
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,598
that might be lost in many cases

1016
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
yes and it's actually one reason why

1017
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
it's important to sort of

1018
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,200
stick with the uncertainty and pass

1019
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
the estimate

1020
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
the state estimate as well as like the

1021
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,520
uncertainty around a state estimate pass

1022
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,040
that through

1023
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,240
because if you collapse the uncertainty

1024
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,720
and you treat all estimates as being

1025
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,119
equally precise there's this whole

1026
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,200
dimension of the data that has been

1027
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,480
dropped

1028
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,880
for example in gene expression analysis

1029
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
sometimes there's uncertainty over

1030
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,160
whether a gene is differentially

1031
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,520
expressed or not like it has a

1032
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,440
distribution and you pick some cut off

1033
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
but then sometimes people take the genes

1034
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,200
on one side of that line

1035
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
and then they just move forward with

1036
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,920
them like these are the differentially

1037
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,079
expressed genes as if it was a discrete

1038
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,960
categorization now take a continuum

1039
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
and then discretize it which makes

1040
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,119
certain kinds of analyses really simple

1041
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,520
or straightforward but

1042
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,599
a whole aspect of the variability of the

1043
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,839
data has been completely crunched out

1044
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,920
stephen

1045
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah and this also then ties into scale

1046
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,200
as well um you know you could

1047
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
and and how much so like you mentioned

1048
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,760
the thermometer so the thermometer gives

1049
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,000
a fairly

1050
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
um well fairly precise

1051
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
sense of the

1052
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
of of the reading it's fairly consistent

1053
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,200
and um it's averaging out the average is

1054
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,640
is fairly

1055
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
relatively accurate in terms of the

1056
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,480
average but it's not going to give you

1057
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
the range or the

1058
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,359
the spread within that and that that can

1059
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,200
apply to a number of things and then you

1060
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,680
as you go down to less and less if you

1061
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
for instance i suppose like you would

1062
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
say if someone's purely looking at one

1063
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,320
ant

1064
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,680
or one ants

1065
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
behavior at a time

1066
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,760
then

1067
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,000
you you might have this sense of i'm

1068
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
being very accurate in terms of my ant

1069
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
analysis

1070
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
so to speak however

1071
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
at the level of the

1072
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,320
you know the larger colony

1073
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,640
you're you're you're not as accurate you

1074
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,720
know so there's some interesting

1075
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,599
sort of

1076
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,200
scale things that can't be avoided

1077
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
really

1078
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,280
yeah are ants accurate or and or are

1079
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,680
ants precise the nest mates

1080
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,880
so

1081
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
it's almost like maybe we could think of

1082
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
them as being um

1083
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
high accuracy but low precision like

1084
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,079
let's just imagine what that would be

1085
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,400
like for the colony so

1086
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,079
each forager

1087
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,119
is

1088
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,280
in the neighborhood of making adequate

1089
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,920
foraging decisions but there's a lot of

1090
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,200
noise around that so over thousands of

1091
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
interactions and foraging trips

1092
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
you're going to end up getting

1093
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,240
a lot of your points

1094
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,800
in the middle so it's cheap because it's

1095
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
lower precision so you can have simpler

1096
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,000
subunits

1097
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,119
but it's centered around the target

1098
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,800
whereas if you have it centered over

1099
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
something that's not the target

1100
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,280
it's going to be sub optimally adaptive

1101
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,880
for the colony

1102
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,760
but i think ants just show that um it's

1103
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,960
not about making every single action

1104
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
perfectly

1105
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,440
um

1106
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,359
the right one it's about being right

1107
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,280
more often than not and then just doing

1108
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,200
it many many many times which is related

1109
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,040
to that sort of um

1110
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,279
develop slash fails succeed forward

1111
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,839
sorry go ahead steven

1112
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,680
just just one thing i think this is also

1113
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,800
useful just in the sense of

1114
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
and it's almost implicit with the

1115
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,560
agent-based modeling approaches that get

1116
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,720
used in biology but it's quite

1117
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,920
interesting in the sense that that

1118
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,319
brings in that inter-subjective piece

1119
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,920
what are these ants trying to do for

1120
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,599
instance how are they trying to organize

1121
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,880
what's going on

1122
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,319
rather than the first person perspective

1123
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
i what do i see

1124
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,720
what's my perspective on the ant as an

1125
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,079
observer which might be more

1126
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,400
psychological in our

1127
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,319
world or

1128
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,000
what is it that i see the group doing on

1129
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,560
average like the temperature

1130
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,079
but when you start to get into

1131
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,440
agent-based

1132
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,839
approaches um

1133
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,560
it it does allow this second person um

1134
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,200
stuff to happen which is really

1135
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,680
i know in psychology is the missing

1136
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,160
piece really in a lot of cases

1137
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,520
so um you know how this how this in a

1138
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,760
way also ties into

1139
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,079
thinking about agents

1140
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,480
rather than thinking about what i see

1141
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
someone or something doing from the

1142
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,839
outside and

1143
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,319
inferring from their behaviors

1144
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,480
externally

1145
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,880
qualitatively sets up a different type

1146
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,400
of um

1147
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,680
experiment or modelling

1148
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,280
so i wonder about the different

1149
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
um scales like as we scale from the nest

1150
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,800
me to the colony like are

1151
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
are they comparable like are they asking

1152
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,920
the same question like the colony wants

1153
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,440
to know like will there be enough food

1154
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,960
and the forager never asked that

1155
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,560
question the forager always wants to

1156
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,200
know where is the food right like so so

1157
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,280
they're asking very different kinds of

1158
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,880
because the forager knows it has no

1159
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,800
uncertainty that that its job is to find

1160
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,359
food right and and so the colony wants

1161
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,200
to have enough food but the forager

1162
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,480
always wants to get the food and i

1163
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
wonder how this kind of asking different

1164
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,319
questions

1165
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,800
scales to things like the brain and

1166
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
components of the brain like

1167
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,040
or the internet and components of the

1168
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,720
internet like like what are our is is

1169
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,319
what defines a scale whether we're

1170
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,440
asking the the same question or not like

1171
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,920
or or is it the goal of the system that

1172
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,319
defines the scale of the system i don't

1173
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,000
know it just made me think about

1174
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,040
yeah i mean that's a good

1175
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,119
that's a really good point i mean yeah

1176
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,040
you could if you're starting to look

1177
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,960
from the agent

1178
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,240
and you could even think about that in

1179
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,480
the brain like yeah if different parts

1180
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,319
of the brain

1181
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,440
are

1182
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,520
foraging information

1183
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
so it's not like that that would explain

1184
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,200
a little bit why you have these kind of

1185
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,560
parts

1186
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
you know

1187
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,000
you know parts the you know different

1188
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,680
parts of the brain have different

1189
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,599
personality

1190
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,079
um queries going on even when certain

1191
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,599
parts of the brain get sort of put to

1192
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,079
sleep so to speak so

1193
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,040
um

1194
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,520
rather than yeah i mean that could be

1195
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,839
that could

1196
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,599
explain and if they're if they're each

1197
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,079
working away i mean

1198
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,760
like a colony

1199
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,440
um and

1200
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,680
yeah who which one is in some of them

1201
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,839
get to be in the driving seat

1202
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,200
and some just

1203
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
yeah some get to ask different questions

1204
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,800
or some get to sort of have their

1205
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
questions to influence other questions

1206
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,880
and some of them just get on and do

1207
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
their thing if that makes sense you're a

1208
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,119
forager basically you're gonna forage

1209
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,040
right that's the deal but someone else

1210
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,359
it might be like i'm hungry

1211
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,200
you got a forage more

1212
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,880
right

1213
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,720
oh just i i

1214
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,440
rapidly assembling some image memes

1215
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
it actually breaks down well into the

1216
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
the chess and other

1217
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,680
fields other serious games

1218
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,000
of tactics and strategy

1219
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,119
so

1220
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,000
um strategy so like blue your question

1221
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
the colony was asking do

1222
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
we slash i we don't know what pronouns

1223
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,240
the colony uses do we slash i have

1224
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,640
enough food it's as if it's asking that

1225
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,920
question

1226
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,880
does it identify as a entity

1227
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,000
an i

1228
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
or does it identify as an ensemble

1229
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,720
we don't know but then the nest may is

1230
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,119
asking the more tactical

1231
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,680
and action-oriented question

1232
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,599
which at a first pass is like where is

1233
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,760
the food but we know that

1234
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,160
in active inference what matters isn't

1235
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
just like simply inference on the

1236
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,480
location of the food out there but what

1237
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,800
matters is inference on our action

1238
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,640
selection for how we're going to get

1239
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,000
that food or how we're going to

1240
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
implement a strategy that

1241
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,480
has a good trade-off of us finding it so

1242
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,160
like here

1243
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,520
chess meme

1244
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,880
um

1245
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,160
tactics

1246
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,760
mean doing what you can with what you

1247
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,839
have so like whatever pieces are on the

1248
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,720
board

1249
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,000
you're gonna have to do some sort of

1250
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,880
action selection for your next move

1251
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,440
here strategy requires thought tactics

1252
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,520
require observation so it's kind of

1253
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,599
interesting because observation is one

1254
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,520
of our terms in the ontology like the

1255
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,319
agent is receiving observation without

1256
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,599
observations

1257
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,760
tactics cannot be implemented

1258
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,920
and then strategies requiring mental

1259
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,680
action just like our previous

1260
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,079
discussions in 28 the thought is

1261
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,319
actually the planning

1262
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,280
over

1263
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,599
observation strategies

1264
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,440
uh nice double blue

1265
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,400
and um there's other definitions of

1266
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,640
strategy and tactics and how they're

1267
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,079
similar or different so that's just kind

1268
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,040
of like

1269
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,839
cool that um it's a way to think about

1270
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,359
maybe not just that

1271
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,040
are the levels asking different or the

1272
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,760
same questions but might levels

1273
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
be defined or delineated by the

1274
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,359
difference in the questions that they

1275
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,560
ask

1276
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,440
with

1277
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,920
independent of the spatial size of the

1278
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,119
subunit

1279
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,240
the more tactical is like more agent

1280
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,040
level and then the more strategic

1281
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,280
requiring reflection or cumulative

1282
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
culture or mental action

1283
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,040
that level is being implemented by

1284
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,759
higher and higher

1285
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,119
nestings wait blew your mute because you

1286
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,359
went down to just one

1287
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,040
can you hear me yeah

1288
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,079
perfect

1289
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,920
um i i went down to just one so you can

1290
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,599
share the names with us because i'm

1291
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,119
missing out on the meme action and i

1292
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,000
like i can't stand it a little bit

1293
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,720
i'm so sorry

1294
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,598
um

1295
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,880
so so speaking of action and and

1296
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
different levels so this is something

1297
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,559
that i've really like been thinking

1298
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,440
about over the course of the last week

1299
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,480
uh this is like the next question on on

1300
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,880
on this slide 11.

1301
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,400
is this this prospect of

1302
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,880
intergenerational stigmergy

1303
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
and i just wonder like you know as we

1304
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,680
were both foraging for memes and slide

1305
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,800
content like creating the

1306
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,040
29.0 like we have this internet right

1307
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,280
and so like we just google search for

1308
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,960
whatever and informational foraging i

1309
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
know is not the same as maybe ants

1310
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,280
foraging for you know a

1311
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,240
food

1312
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,400
but um you know we're both foraging we

1313
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,559
come across the same kind of content and

1314
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,680
ended up like putting it into the 29.0

1315
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,359
in different ways in different places

1316
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,839
and and i just wonder you know there's

1317
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,800
this concept of of intergenerational

1318
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,760
stigmargy that's very uh i

1319
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,480
and i wonder if this is human-centric or

1320
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
if there are other examples of this in

1321
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,240
the animal kingdom and perhaps among

1322
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,000
ants i know daniel we've talked at

1323
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,280
length about

1324
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,400
um

1325
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
the different foraging habits for

1326
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,680
example of

1327
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,839
different um

1328
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,599
different foraging habits of different

1329
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,000
species or the same species of different

1330
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
colonies

1331
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,680
and so where do they get this habit like

1332
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,359
to forage differently like at different

1333
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,119
times of the day or whatever and and it

1334
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,359
spans generations and so is there some

1335
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,960
trace left in the environment like

1336
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
humans we leave traces for the next

1337
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
generation i mean we directly do some

1338
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,520
cumulative cultural evolution transfer

1339
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,040
um and there are other species i know

1340
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,119
that that teach like dolphins i know

1341
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,040
teach like some foraging habits and so

1342
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,200
forth so so

1343
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,359
what other examples do we have of this

1344
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,319
kind of intergenerational stigmergy or

1345
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,079
like you know we leave traces like the

1346
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,400
time capsule of you know like what to

1347
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,480
find like every decade we open up the

1348
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,400
time capsule from you know whatever the

1349
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
previous decade was and find things like

1350
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,680
eight tracks and

1351
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,599
like whatever things that are put in the

1352
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,280
time capsule that are just like oh look

1353
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,760
way back in the day um so i don't know

1354
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,680
what do you think about that um just

1355
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
relative to ants and relative to this

1356
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,520
intergenerational stigma g and the

1357
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
different foraging habits of colonies

1358
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,920
from the same species

1359
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,960
good

1360
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,400
question

1361
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,599
and

1362
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:50,800
uh

1363
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,280
where did the priors for foraging come

1364
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,559
from

1365
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,880
and then to what extent is there

1366
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
scaffolding of one nest mate in their

1367
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,559
foraging activity by

1368
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,960
older nest mates which is actually

1369
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,440
within a generation that's like sort of

1370
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,359
some skin cells being scaffolded by

1371
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,520
previous skin cells it's like if you

1372
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,839
just kill all the foragers of a colony

1373
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,319
the foragers that step into those rules

1374
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,920
will perform

1375
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,319
sub optimally that's actually related to

1376
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,440
colony collapse in the honeybees

1377
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,400
so there's some element of like they

1378
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,000
have an inkling

1379
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,400
of how to

1380
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,119
adapt their foraging

1381
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,319
yet um also there's flexibility um i

1382
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,559
mean

1383
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,839
it just makes me think of how we could

1384
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:42,800
actually

1385
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,040
study it like putting nest mates in

1386
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,359
different environments or

1387
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,119
having uh

1388
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,079
one colony and splitting it and

1389
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,520
training it a certain way and then

1390
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,000
reintegrating them and seeing if

1391
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,310
um

1392
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,680
[Music]

1393
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,440
what mattered more was like the

1394
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,200
environment at that generation or

1395
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,440
whether it was possible to have

1396
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,839
epigenomic or genomic

1397
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,880
changes that sort of lock in and and uh

1398
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,240
shape foraging

1399
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,079
and then on um

1400
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,839
12 you know i'm

1401
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,040
doing a little live meme modification

1402
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,599
like foraging is not an act but a habit

1403
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,760
with a probably misattributed aristotle

1404
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,880
quote

1405
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,000
so it's almost like forging is not an

1406
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,880
act

1407
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,599
it's a policy

1408
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
it's a policy over

1409
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,319
specific motor actions

1410
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,200
uh

1411
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
but yeah the intergenerational part is

1412
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,480
very interesting

1413
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,800
and it

1414
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,920
i'm just thinking if there's other true

1415
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,240
intergenerational ant scaffolding one

1416
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,559
example not in foraging is like when a

1417
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,319
leaf cutter ant

1418
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,200
queen goes on her nuptial flight she

1419
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,640
takes a

1420
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,200
little sub-sample of the fungal garden

1421
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,440
and uses that to start the next

1422
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,800
generation

1423
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,680
which

1424
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
actually i think relates to the second

1425
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,200
point you had about 30.

1426
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,440
so that's super interesting and also um

1427
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,520
directly related to

1428
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,480
um the microbe transfer right like you

1429
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,440
think about um microbial transfer that

1430
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,520
happens um

1431
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,200
like through the birth canal like

1432
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,040
there's a difference between

1433
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,280
c-sections delivered babies and babies

1434
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,720
that actually pass through the birth

1435
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,599
canal

1436
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,359
just in terms of how they're inoculated

1437
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,200
as well as breastfed babies versus

1438
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,880
formula fed babies

1439
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,480
there's a huge like inoculation

1440
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,119
difference with your like but just

1441
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,599
microbial flora

1442
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,000
and so that that is the

1443
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,400
uh and i wonder what um you know this

1444
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,359
speaks to the holobiont concept

1445
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,720
like we're not just humans we're humans

1446
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,400
inoculated with all kinds of things and

1447
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,960
maybe ants aren't just ants they're ants

1448
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,160
plus that fungal and i have there's been

1449
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
studies on that fungus

1450
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,680
like on the fungal composition is it

1451
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,079
different from colony to colony

1452
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,280
um do you know i don't know

1453
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,240
i know that uh one

1454
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,680
group in my previous lab they tr they

1455
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,520
isolated nest mates and then they

1456
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,440
treated them with antibiotics and

1457
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,680
changed their microbiome and they

1458
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,000
and others have also shown that there's

1459
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,280
a role for the microbiome in recognition

1460
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,119
so um

1461
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,440
because it modifies the smell

1462
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,240
of the ants that modifies how they

1463
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,839
recognize each other

1464
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,800
um maybe that's more like a dialect

1465
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,400
like that's kind of how they recognize

1466
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
that they're in the very short time

1467
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,880
range like in the same

1468
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
group or they're they're likely to be

1469
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,040
collaborative but i i returned to eight

1470
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,640
to think about what you just described

1471
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,839
about like the body and the inheritance

1472
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,480
of

1473
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,119
microbial forms like

1474
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,760
is there a way to refer to that human is

1475
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,160
the species but then you know if humans

1476
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,760
contain and are

1477
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,000
multitudes

1478
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,680
you know there's the body there's the

1479
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,520
other life forms

1480
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
there's social

1481
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,240
uh interactors

1482
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,800
humans aren't the species but the host

1483
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,559
which ties in very nicely to our next um

1484
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,319
live stream which i'm very excited about

1485
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,280
uh

1486
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,559
which um

1487
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,720
with matthew sims he's gonna come and

1488
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,240
talk to us about

1489
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
uh the symbiosis between

1490
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,440
squid and vibrio fischeri in the light

1491
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,319
organ

1492
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,000
which is something near and dear to my

1493
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,319
heart i worked in new mexico i don't

1494
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,280
know

1495
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,760
uh how is this possible in um right

1496
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,359
upstairs you know you have those labs

1497
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,559
that like you know everybody in the lab

1498
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,559
and you guys can come and work and

1499
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,720
um like share equipment sometimes and so

1500
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,119
i knew this lab and our lab were very

1501
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,000
close uh the lab of michelle nishiguchi

1502
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,319
and she studied vibrio fisheries and the

1503
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,400
light organ so i knew all these people

1504
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,799
doing directly related projects

1505
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,280
but that's it's a really cool uh concept

1506
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,640
that you know

1507
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,079
maybe we're all in some form of

1508
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,480
symbiosis and i know in mice they have

1509
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,319
sterilized mice and the mice grow up

1510
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,720
totally neurotic like mice lacking the

1511
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,880
microbiome free mice like they're

1512
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,640
completely neurotic and have way

1513
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,559
abnormal behavior and they've linked a

1514
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,760
lot of you know human behavior or human

1515
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,280
abnormal or abnormal behavior or

1516
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,920
neuroatypical behavior to microbiome

1517
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,680
stuff as well so so it's really

1518
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,040
interesting to think about maybe we're

1519
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,920
all symbians in some

1520
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,400
fashion i mean and like maybe we're not

1521
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,839
the species but we're just the host

1522
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
reminds me of um

1523
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,119
demetrius bolus

1524
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,920
speaking about the through others we

1525
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,920
become ourselves and it was situating

1526
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,160
active inference in the dialectical

1527
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,440
tradition

1528
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,880
and um you have a coming together

1529
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,079
of different pieces and they don't

1530
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,720
reduce their distinction they actually

1531
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,440
become especially over evolutionary time

1532
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
more polarized like the nuclear genome

1533
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
becomes more nuclear the mitochondrial

1534
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,559
genome becomes more reduced in

1535
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,520
mitochondrial or the host becomes

1536
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,359
on one trajectory and the parasite goes

1537
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,480
in the other they don't converge and

1538
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,520
equalize each other they end up becoming

1539
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
increasingly specialized parts

1540
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,520
in

1541
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,640
a newly emergent type of system

1542
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,079
and then these multi-specified

1543
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,960
systems can be fragile because maybe now

1544
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
there's a failure mode of the part

1545
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,640
and then that causes the whole system to

1546
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,799
fail so like bucky fuller would always

1547
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
talk about how

1548
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,880
um all cases of biological extinction

1549
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,760
are due to over-specialization

1550
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,680
might be a bit of an overstatement but

1551
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,680
that's sort of the idea is like

1552
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,000
generalists can deal with changing

1553
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,599
niches better

1554
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,160
because they're always able to

1555
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
hedge their bets

1556
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,240
amidst uncertainty and average out over

1557
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
all the different um foraging

1558
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,880
investments whereas a specialist does

1559
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,640
really well until they don't but in life

1560
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,799
it's not just like you can do well most

1561
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,720
the time and then you can fail sometimes

1562
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,559
living systems need to

1563
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:23,440
be

1564
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,760
succeeding at least adequately all the

1565
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,480
time

1566
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,799
if any part of your body was under

1567
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,680
producing atp for like five minutes

1568
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,680
it would get tissue damage so it's

1569
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,200
better to be adequate all the time

1570
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,920
rather than hyper successful for even

1571
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,599
almost all the time

1572
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,280
and then what kinds of strategies are

1573
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,799
resilient amongst that kind of

1574
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,000
uncertainty and situation

1575
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,920
so about halfway through what you were

1576
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,760
saying i wondered when we started having

1577
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,480
a political discussion

1578
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,240
because it just really you know speaks

1579
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,680
to

1580
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,760
specialization or maybe

1581
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,599
polarization um which we see in society

1582
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,359
so like you know we have these different

1583
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,920
factions or different like sub

1584
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,079
types or sub classes

1585
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,079
of of people and biological systems

1586
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,520
that don't

1587
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,640
become

1588
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
more like one another they become

1589
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,520
more separate from one another and i

1590
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,640
think um you know in the resounding echo

1591
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,040
chamber that is um

1592
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,000
you know

1593
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
a self similar political

1594
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,839
environment or class environment you

1595
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,680
know it becomes this this echo chamber

1596
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,200
that that um

1597
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,160
you know just increases our

1598
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,119
uh

1599
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,119
certainty right increases the the

1600
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,000
validity of our own model

1601
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,920
and it makes us question

1602
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,520
the model of others so i wonder

1603
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,079
uh and this brings us back to uh what

1604
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,319
we're going to discuss with matthew sims

1605
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,599
next week

1606
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,200
um

1607
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,760
is that right or is the jet like is the

1608
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,760
generative model

1609
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,880
becoming more similar for the fisheries

1610
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,640
vapor fisheries in the squid or is it

1611
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,240
becoming

1612
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,920
more different

1613
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,040
i i just wonder yep uh um

1614
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,720
so through interaction do we become more

1615
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,200
similar or different

1616
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,480
or what kinds of systems through

1617
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,000
interaction become more similar or

1618
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,960
different

1619
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,839
and then

1620
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,559
how can systems be

1621
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,119
more anti-fragile given that

1622
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,200
relationship amongst the subunits

1623
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,520
versus which which failure modes are you

1624
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,079
de-risking on and which failure modes

1625
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,960
are you increasing the risk on

1626
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,160
like

1627
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,760
so it's an interesting question i mean

1628
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,640
it's not just political it is very

1629
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,520
um broad question

1630
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,680
blue let's look at the code

1631
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,440
and maybe just scan through some

1632
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,720
sections of it and then start to see um

1633
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,640
in on 11

1634
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,880
before we get to the code it's just like

1635
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,799
what else could we include in an ant

1636
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,680
model like this was um we talked about

1637
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,119
the natural history of the ant that we

1638
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,160
templated off of the formica species in

1639
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,200
the paper

1640
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,760
but um we used one pheromone we didn't

1641
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,640
have interactions you know we had such

1642
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,200
um a sparse

1643
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,799
uh

1644
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,960
pulling over of features of ants into

1645
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,200
our model so that's why it's just like a

1646
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,680
introductory framework so what what

1647
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,400
other pieces could exist for ants

1648
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
and we can kind of use the active

1649
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,520
inference

1650
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,799
um breakdown of what perceptions could

1651
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,040
we add in tactile interactions other

1652
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,960
olfactory interactions

1653
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,839
light

1654
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:40,559
the

1655
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,720
intensity the color the polarization of

1656
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,920
light

1657
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,839
another type of polarization what type

1658
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,640
of cognition could we add in so this was

1659
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,359
like a one-step decision-making ants it

1660
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,880
just makes a decision for the next time

1661
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
step based upon the local pheromone

1662
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,000
density what kind of cognitive processes

1663
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,720
actually exist in ants or what kind

1664
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,480
might be interesting to see

1665
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,440
in different systems like memory

1666
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,680
and then what actions exist

1667
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,319
here we had a movement action affordance

1668
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,880
any of the directions and then we had

1669
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,160
sort of a pheromone deposit affordance

1670
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,760
that didn't actually have a specific um

1671
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,799
control policy it was just a if then if

1672
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,720
you already touch the seed then you

1673
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,720
deposit pheromone if you're still

1674
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,559
looking for the seed then you don't

1675
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,599
deposit fairmont so we can think what

1676
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,440
are the perceptions cognitions and

1677
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,200
actions of the aliens as currently

1678
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,359
modeled in the paper and then where can

1679
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,640
we go with that

1680
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,760
and then

1681
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,440
to go from that question about the

1682
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,040
simulation

1683
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,839
to meet the empirical data the other

1684
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,280
side of the table

1685
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
what kinds of ant data

1686
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,960
already exist

1687
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,960
there are several very fascinating

1688
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,240
databases

1689
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,440
that include genomics

1690
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,200
gene expression transcriptomic and

1691
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,720
epigenome or epigenomics datasets

1692
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,559
they're sparser for ants than they are

1693
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,400
for humans and mice but

1694
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,680
they are out there and there will be

1695
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,440
more of them in the future

1696
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,039
what kind of behavioral data already

1697
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,280
exists ethology

1698
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,440
the study of animal behavior

1699
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,880
video data

1700
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,559
maybe they analyzed it under a certain

1701
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,599
framework but now it could be

1702
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,799
readdressed

1703
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,920
and then like rfid and qr codes that can

1704
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,079
do semi-automated high-throughput

1705
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,200
tracking so people attach rfid chips to

1706
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,640
honeybees and

1707
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,200
track their foraging activity

1708
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,799
and then we also have information on

1709
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,680
their ecology and morphology so features

1710
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,839
of which we're not in our simulation so

1711
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,160
this is just this sort of prime looking

1712
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,680
at the code

1713
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,079
by asking like how could the code be

1714
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,280
modified

1715
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,400
and then how

1716
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,920
could the world

1717
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,839
already be seen as reaching out to us

1718
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,839
with these helpful pieces of data

1719
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,760
and then where are we going to be in the

1720
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,000
middle like what kind of model is going

1721
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,760
to connect the empirical data sets that

1722
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,359
do or could exist

1723
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,880
to the models

1724
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,000
that do or could exist and then what

1725
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,720
questions are most important because we

1726
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,280
want to be asking relevant questions and

1727
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,640
so it's better to be keeping the goals

1728
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,160
in mind as we look through everything

1729
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,599
okay let me just

1730
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:23,680
re-crop this window while i get the code

1731
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,640
up

1732
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,079
anything you would just say on the

1733
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,920
overview or like

1734
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,200
general thoughts on the kind of

1735
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,359
multi-agent simulations or foraging

1736
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,000
simulations that you've made

1737
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,720
uh just i have some questions about this

1738
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,960
simulation actually or some some things

1739
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,400
that i would think about to include as

1740
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,440
parameters like in a dream simulation

1741
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,280
where we you know could can simulate

1742
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,200
whatever with unlimited computational

1743
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,240
power and

1744
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,440
relative world data um so i think that

1745
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,880
uh

1746
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,960
here i'm interested in nestmate

1747
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,880
interactions so i think that that would

1748
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,240
be something that would be interesting

1749
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,960
to model like the different types of

1750
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,760
ants that exist like the nurse maids and

1751
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,039
the foragers and the queen and the uh

1752
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,799
reproducers i can't remember we went

1753
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:09,920
through all the different types of nest

1754
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,280
meats last time but i would just be

1755
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,400
interested in

1756
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,119
in kind of simulating how

1757
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,400
as a colony ants interact and function i

1758
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,480
know that that's like you know

1759
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,839
very

1760
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,000
whatever big and i mean in most

1761
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,920
simulations that i've always done it's

1762
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,119
like the same type of um

1763
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,599
the same type of agent right like so you

1764
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,200
give the agent different options but

1765
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,720
it's never like

1766
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,559
this agent doesn't forage and this agent

1767
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,720
does i don't know but i mean i know that

1768
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,359
they do have different people do do some

1769
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,960
modeling with different types of agents

1770
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,400
but i just wonder what the compute power

1771
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,440
is and

1772
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,280
what the validity of that is

1773
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,559
yes great

1774
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,359
okay

1775
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,079
so

1776
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,000
we're gonna um

1777
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,200
take a sort of uh a stepwise approach

1778
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,720
and one thing that i think will be fun

1779
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,440
is

1780
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,119
there's people who know way more about

1781
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,119
python and coding

1782
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,319
than both of us for sure including alec

1783
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,720
chance and others and then there might

1784
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,559
be others for whom

1785
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,000
they've learned about active inference

1786
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,440
or they've read a lot about it maybe

1787
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,119
even looked at the math

1788
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,520
but here is going to be where we see how

1789
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,240
it looks in code so there are these

1790
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,119
multiple languages and ways of

1791
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,799
communicating and learning by doing

1792
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,839
active inference like natural language

1793
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,760
math as a language

1794
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,000
programming as a language art as a

1795
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,680
language maybe there's other ways too

1796
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,520
but at the very least we know that we

1797
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,119
have natural language

1798
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,960
mathematical formalisms like the

1799
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,799
equations that we're always putting up

1800
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,319
and then here's the code

1801
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,520
those

1802
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,039
threads might be

1803
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,680
looking more similar or different

1804
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,599
as we start to learn more about like

1805
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,520
interactive notebooks

1806
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,359
and ways to

1807
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,880
integrate our language use

1808
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,520
of the natural kind with the programming

1809
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,480
kind

1810
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,359
so

1811
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,319
we're gonna do kind of a a step down

1812
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,160
first we're going to look at the config

1813
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,799
file so the readme file in this case is

1814
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,839
not super informative which is fine

1815
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,760
um but the config file is where we're

1816
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,039
going to start that's going to tell us

1817
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,039
about like what kinds of variables and

1818
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,480
parameters matter

1819
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,799
then we're gonna look at figure one and

1820
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,720
that's just sort of gonna be like okay

1821
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,480
this is how you run it and then we're

1822
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,200
gonna pull back to the ans dot py

1823
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,799
and look at what functions and

1824
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,559
subroutines are actually defined inside

1825
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,680
the code

1826
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,240
so inside of the config file it's only

1827
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,039
30 lines long 31 lines long

1828
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,960
and it has

1829
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,559
some pretty

1830
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,280
clearly defined variables that are being

1831
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,400
set

1832
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,880
and the idea is that all the parameters

1833
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,119
are stored in this file so that you can

1834
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,200
kind of hit play and then it will look

1835
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
to this config file we'll see where that

1836
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,720
happens in a second

1837
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,319
and so

1838
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,520
the first block relates to um

1839
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,119
if you want to add the ants in a

1840
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,599
staggered fashion how many how many time

1841
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,359
steps should happen between adding new

1842
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,280
ants in

1843
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,640
um

1844
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,720
uh how many or what's the location of

1845
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,200
where the ants should begin

1846
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,039
nest factor we can

1847
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,200
look at i'm not exactly sure

1848
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,119
um

1849
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,359
it is here

1850
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,200
it relate i'm not exactly sure where

1851
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,720
what the nest factor has to do it might

1852
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,000
have to do with the distance of the nest

1853
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,119
but

1854
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,359
let's ask alec on that one the grid is

1855
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,760
the side size of the map so here's a 40

1856
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,520
by 40.

1857
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,559
um

1858
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,240
and then here

1859
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,839
is a very interesting block it's the

1860
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,079
focal area which is three by three so

1861
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,880
that's the grid around each nest mate is

1862
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,280
just three cells by three cells

1863
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,359
and so this could be changed to you know

1864
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,280
like four by four or

1865
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,119
something like what happens when the ant

1866
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,520
has a broader range of perception than

1867
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,440
it might have for action

1868
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,520
and that's the action map

1869
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,760
and so those are the um the actions that

1870
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,000
can be undertaken

1871
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,240
relating to basically moving like down

1872
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,960
into the left or up into the right

1873
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
the food location

1874
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,480
and the size of the food are provided

1875
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,560
then the wall

1876
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,799
so that specifies like within the grid

1877
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,640
what is the shape of the maze inside of

1878
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,600
the map

1879
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,479
24 and 25 describe the

1880
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,158
the number of discretized levels of

1881
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,319
pheromone that exist and then a factor

1882
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,319
that is the stochastic decay of the

1883
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,080
pheromone trail

1884
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,359
and then

1885
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,319
here the observation states so like the

1886
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,040
o in the active inference model

1887
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,000
are

1888
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,839
defined as the number of pheromone

1889
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,000
levels so in this case

1890
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,640
those are both 1 or 10 discrete models

1891
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,759
but

1892
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,679
it's so interesting because it opens up

1893
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,640
the door for the generative process to

1894
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,560
differ from the generative model so like

1895
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,799
the observations

1896
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,799
could be there could be um

1897
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,799
three categories of observation low

1898
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,158
medium and high

1899
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,158
and so you could still have a continuous

1900
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,640
variable or discretized variable in the

1901
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,759
world in the generative process but the

1902
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,479
generative model could be over a reduced

1903
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,479
version of that which might be all you

1904
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,158
need to know maybe there's enough

1905
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,080
stochasticity such that just knowing if

1906
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,759
you're in high medium low

1907
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,439
tells you whether to put on a jacket or

1908
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,960
not you know you don't need five decimal

1909
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,880
points on the temperature

1910
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,000
and um the number of action states is

1911
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,319
also reduced to the focal size but just

1912
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,880
as mentioned that could also diverge

1913
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,520
and then the um the length of the

1914
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,319
simulation i think is specified in 31.

1915
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,920
so those are some of the parameters that

1916
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,600
exist just in the

1917
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,839
base simulation some of the degrees of

1918
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,839
freedom that do exist and that's even

1919
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,600
before introducing these like other

1920
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,920
sorts of um pieces that could exist okay

1921
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,520
any thoughts here before we go to figure

1922
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,199
one

1923
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,840
just like you know i mean i i always

1924
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,440
want to know like why

1925
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,320
like why did you choose this or like did

1926
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,560
you play with the decay factor or did

1927
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,159
you play with like the length the time

1928
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,239
steps i'm sure like maybe your reviewers

1929
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,640
commented that as well but um i just

1930
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,640
wanted like i'm always curious to see

1931
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,800
like was there any

1932
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,679
like

1933
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,040
unexpected outcomes or optimal outcomes

1934
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,600
that occurred like peak like did you

1935
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,760
pick 500 time steps because that was you

1936
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,480
know best or the decay factor of 0.01

1937
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,679
because that was most real realistic or

1938
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,360
those types of things

1939
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,800
good questions

1940
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,320
and i think we we probably could have um

1941
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,239
organized these with some sub headers

1942
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,679
and some comments a little bit more

1943
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,040
clearly

1944
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,239
so

1945
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,800
we're going to look at how the

1946
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,600
simulation gets specified and then pull

1947
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,000
back to like what are the subroutines

1948
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,600
so the the top part of a python program

1949
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,719
is basically pulling in and then giving

1950
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,280
nicknames to other resources that are

1951
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,080
required so these resources can include

1952
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,440
packages like numpy which is a common

1953
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,040
toolkit used for

1954
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,080
um

1955
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,239
math and statistics in python i'm sure

1956
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,640
blue can say more on that one and then

1957
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,920
there's this um

1958
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,520
the config

1959
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,199
as the cf

1960
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,360
so that's when we call like cf dot

1961
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,199
number of observations

1962
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,679
that's going to call like this

1963
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,320
which is defined as this which is 10

1964
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,800
but of course that can be changed so

1965
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
that's where the variables that are set

1966
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,520
in the config file come into play

1967
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,800
so the header

1968
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,520
sort of introduces the um

1969
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,560
the background libraries and resources

1970
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
that need to be imported

1971
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,840
then

1972
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,960
um a few parameters are defined so that

1973
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,600
you can have like a base config set

1974
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,080
and then you can also just um locally

1975
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,400
define some variables like the number of

1976
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,880
initial ants is um

1977
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,159
like

1978
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,880
you can define variables that are in

1979
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,480
the config file or you can add some new

1980
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,040
variables in

1981
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,880
and then um

1982
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,840
basically

1983
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,760
uh

1984
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,040
the

1985
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,840
uh

1986
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,280
for

1987
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,440
the observations

1988
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,440
in the length of the range of

1989
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,320
observations

1990
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,480
this runs

1991
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,040
a routine

1992
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,159
and um

1993
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,520
the routine is going to be defined

1994
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,840
better in and stop py

1995
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,159
but it basically says we're going to run

1996
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,520
it

1997
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,679
for that many steps for that many

1998
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,560
starting ants for that many maximum ants

1999
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,320
we're gonna save it

2000
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,719
we're gonna switch the location of the

2001
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,000
food

2002
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,840
and then we're gonna just print some

2003
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,760
summary descriptors

2004
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,320
like the number of round trips

2005
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,120
uh

2006
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,360
and then

2007
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,400
save that

2008
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:56,580
in

2009
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,760
[Music]

2010
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,520
a file

2011
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,360
so that's like sort of the

2012
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,360
interface wrapper

2013
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,840
for running a simulation and then

2014
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,760
outputting some of the descriptive

2015
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,159
statistics and then also saving

2016
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:13,040
that file

2017
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,480
now ants.py is

2018
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,760
353 lines long so

2019
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,040
um it's a little bit longer

2020
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,960
but there are some parts that we could i

2021
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,520
think walk through

2022
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,679
the first is that like

2023
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,480
the ant is a class

2024
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,239
of object

2025
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,239
and it has um a few routines

2026
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:41,520
it has its initiation routine

2027
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,440
which is where its x and y position for

2028
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,040
example are given

2029
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,520
the starting location

2030
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,840
and then there's updating a forward and

2031
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,120
a backwards step

2032
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,400
there's the class of the environment so

2033
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,560
this is kind of like if you do net logo

2034
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,239
modeling agent-based modeling you know

2035
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,239
you have like the turtle like the agent

2036
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,000
and then the environment so here we're

2037
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,480
defining the agent and we're defining

2038
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,840
the environment

2039
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,760
and the relationship between the two of

2040
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,040
them is really whether we have um

2041
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,679
a stigmatic type multi-agent system or

2042
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,560
not

2043
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,560
so you could have the environment

2044
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,600
influencing the behavior of agents

2045
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,280
like the sunshine is influencing the

2046
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,679
behavior of the ants but then the ants

2047
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,000
don't modify the sunshine so that

2048
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,320
wouldn't be stigmargy but

2049
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,239
if there's a possibility for the agent

2050
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,080
to modify the environment and for the

2051
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,480
environment to modify the probability of

2052
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,560
agent behaviors there's some sort of

2053
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,199
bi-directional relationship then it is

2054
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,640
stigmargy

2055
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,000
and um

2056
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,840
basically some of the functions that are

2057
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,920
defined for the environment

2058
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,080
have to do with uh

2059
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,040
which

2060
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,920
observations are at a given

2061
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,000
cell

2062
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,480
whether the food exists at a given cell

2063
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,159
whether the walls

2064
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,719
exist at a given cell

2065
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,080
and then the step forward a step

2066
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,600
backward relate to the outgoing and the

2067
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,840
homecoming

2068
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,010
trip and this is basically just um

2069
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,600
[Music]

2070
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,360
uh

2071
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,679
doing a delta which i think is a which

2072
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,440
is the action map it's the delta in

2073
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,360
position

2074
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,239
and then it checks whether the ant is

2075
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,320
returning which is like a gonna be i

2076
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,239
believe on the step backwards side

2077
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,230
and um

2078
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,199
[Music]

2079
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,719
versus the ant

2080
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,360
going forward

2081
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,080
decay is a function that's also inside

2082
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,520
of environments

2083
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,360
because decay has to do with the decay

2084
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,600
of the pheromone at that cell

2085
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,480
and then the plotting has to do with

2086
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,159
just saving

2087
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,400
um the file so that's some of this like

2088
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,000
uh the gif and the save fig

2089
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,400
another object type that's defined and

2090
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,159
this is really where there was the main

2091
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,000
carry over from the previous models is

2092
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,640
the markov decision process

2093
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,920
so here just like we've talked about in

2094
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,840
various contexts like the a b c and d

2095
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,960
are all

2096
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,400
uh

2097
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,679
defined and initiated here

2098
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,280
those are um

2099
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,360
used as you'd expect

2100
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,320
and then the mdp needs to have these

2101
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,080
functions that relate to setting and

2102
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,400
resetting certain variables

2103
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,800
and taking a step and then i love this

2104
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,480
line 210

2105
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,280
action inference like this is sort of

2106
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,719
the kernel

2107
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:37,760
that

2108
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,280
is where it's happening

2109
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,239
here's the negative expected free energy

2110
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,880
and then there's a calculation

2111
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,159
of the negative expected energy of the

2112
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,760
uh negative

2113
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,239
utility calculations

2114
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,640
divided by the scale factor

2115
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,159
pretty interesting and i don't think we

2116
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,159
experimented with modifying this scale

2117
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,000
factor

2118
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,120
and then um so can i just interrupt you

2119
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,400
what does that scale factor do really

2120
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,520
well

2121
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,320
it's mentioned only two times in here

2122
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,199
and

2123
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,519
um

2124
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,199
i'm not exactly sure what it does here

2125
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,440
i think that uh when you're comparing

2126
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,199
relative policies

2127
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,880
as long as you're dividing them all by

2128
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,120
the same scale factor

2129
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,239
it shouldn't change the relative

2130
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,520
preference for different policies if

2131
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,199
they're all being scaled down by the

2132
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,360
same level

2133
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,400
so

2134
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,199
i'm not sure why the calculation exists

2135
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,440
this way

2136
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,000
yeah that i mean it makes sense that

2137
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,320
they're all like whatever you scaled by

2138
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,600
something maybe it's just to make the

2139
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,960
numbers more manageable who knows

2140
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,640
yes

2141
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,040
but we'll let's definitely think about

2142
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,640
that

2143
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,710
and then um

2144
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,640
[Music]

2145
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,840
it yeah

2146
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,520
we could get more explanation from alec

2147
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,880
um but

2148
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,000
the uh

2149
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,880
negative expected free energies

2150
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,840
get so

2151
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
okay well okay one possible

2152
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,000
option would be this is like over

2153
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,520
observations

2154
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,199
so we know that the observations are

2155
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,239
discretized between one and ten

2156
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,480
so if we divide

2157
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,800
by 10 maybe we're going from like a 1 to

2158
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,600
10 scale to a 0 to 1 scale

2159
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,800
which then lets us interpret

2160
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,760
more cleanly as like probabilities

2161
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,040
because

2162
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,840
um the action

2163
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,000
ends up being selected based upon the

2164
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,080
soft max of the negative expected free

2165
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,199
energies

2166
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,040
so instead of like you know eight one

2167
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,480
and one

2168
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,679
if you do

2169
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,560
0.8 0.1 and 0.1 it's really easy to then

2170
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,800
say okay right 80 likelihood of choosing

2171
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,360
this action

2172
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,480
here's a colony level function

2173
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,040
related to an ant being initiated and

2174
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,040
just appearing on the map

2175
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,040
plotting and saving functions and then

2176
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,480
here's the main

2177
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,320
so um

2178
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,480
a lot of times in the python

2179
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,679
programs

2180
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,760
there's like a lot of sort of upstream

2181
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,840
functions that are going to get called

2182
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,800
and then main is called and then when

2183
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,159
main is called that's like where the

2184
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,719
main program actually happens

2185
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,800
so this instantiates the environment the

2186
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,560
ants and the paths

2187
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,760
it for the number of ants in that are to

2188
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,040
be specified that many ants are created

2189
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,640
with reset

2190
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,360
mdps

2191
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,640
all of the image files are set to zero

2192
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,040
the descriptive statistics like how many

2193
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,719
completed trips and the ant locations

2194
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,400
are reset

2195
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,760
and then here

2196
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,400
is the time point time step based

2197
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,560
simulation so here

2198
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,440
for each ant in the ants that exist

2199
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,360
there's going to be some calculations

2200
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,040
this is related to the distance

2201
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,560
calculation

2202
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,800
um

2203
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,719
here's adding the ants

2204
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,679
here's switching the food

2205
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,159
and then here is um checking for each

2206
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,600
ant trajectory

2207
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,040
whether it's returning or completed

2208
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,199
and then saving the file

2209
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,400
so

2210
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,320
again i think there could be a lot more

2211
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,199
organization and commenting

2212
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,719
to sort of understand what these

2213
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,560
different pieces do but

2214
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,400
yeah i believe that's some of the main

2215
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,799
pieces

2216
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,600
nice

2217
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,920
are we gonna move to the figures now

2218
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,080
um

2219
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,400
sure i can actually try to download the

2220
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,560
videos and i can play the videos

2221
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,320
oh yeah that's great so yeah i thought

2222
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,440
we were going to go switch back and

2223
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,480
forth from the code to the

2224
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:12,440
okay so we'll go to the paper

2225
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,239
supplemental data

2226
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:25,360
let's see if we can play it in the

2227
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,839
stream directly

2228
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,480
will it play

2229
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,880
oh great it will play okay so here is

2230
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,520
like the ants

2231
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,120
you'll you won't see it blue but um

2232
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,360
diffusing around the red ones are going

2233
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,120
out and the blue ones are coming home so

2234
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,480
this is just as if you were um watching

2235
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,719
the colony with video

2236
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,360
um video two

2237
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,360
i think we're gonna add in

2238
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,159
the pheromone density so here the

2239
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,080
brighter colors are the pheromone

2240
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,400
density

2241
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,239
and like there like one ant made at home

2242
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,679
but then it didn't

2243
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,199
here comes another one

2244
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,000
it didn't um

2245
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,600
[Music]

2246
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,120
sort of lock on but now we can see

2247
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,040
there's a light ridge

2248
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,480
it's locked on

2249
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,080
to the trail and it's going to reinforce

2250
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,559
the trail

2251
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,760
and then

2252
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,040
it seems like the food has switched

2253
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,239
because now we're seeing some pheromone

2254
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,560
getting deposited on the left side

2255
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,480
and then there's not as much deposition

2256
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,320
on the right side but this is what

2257
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,600
really happens in ants like if there's

2258
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,199
high density of pheromone on that top

2259
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,239
right

2260
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,199
then

2261
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,639
an ants are spending a lot of their time

2262
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,440
there

2263
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,639
especially if they're carrying food they

2264
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,360
might actually be reinforcing

2265
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,520
that part so some of the videos are

2266
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,960
described their similarities and

2267
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,320
differences

2268
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,560
in the text but i think the interesting

2269
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,199
one to look at would be

2270
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,400
i think six and seven

2271
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,920
so here

2272
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,480
there's um here there's a preference for

2273
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,840
high pheromone density

2274
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,280
and then

2275
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,280
i believe it's seven

2276
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,440
where the ants can lay down pheromone

2277
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,159
but they don't have a preference for it

2278
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,080
and so it ends up getting laid down but

2279
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,280
then it doesn't get reinforced because

2280
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,440
they um

2281
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,360
they just don't prefer it so they act

2282
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,719
randomly with respect to pheromone

2283
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,639
um

2284
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,239
but these are just like fun

2285
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,960
simulations and yeah a total

2286
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,800
obvious next step an important one would

2287
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,560
be to

2288
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,040
explore what sets of parameters certain

2289
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,360
outcomes occur within like when do they

2290
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,360
always lock in when do they fail to lock

2291
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,400
in

2292
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,320
um

2293
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,159
but yeah good

2294
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,839
supplemental info

2295
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,879
awesome

2296
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,239
um

2297
01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:00,080
yeah so what what is the next obvious um

2298
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,840
step for you or where would you like to

2299
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,760
see this simulation go

2300
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,920
most like what is the the next if you

2301
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,440
were to you know

2302
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,520
have unlimited time with alec to say

2303
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,159
like let's code xyz

2304
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:17,799
um what what would you uh dream of

2305
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,960
first i'd probably go for the annotation

2306
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,880
and clarification

2307
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,960
because that's like where coding

2308
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,880
expertise really comes into play and

2309
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,480
that helps other people

2310
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,679
modify and build on the code the most

2311
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,920
um

2312
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,000
when it were a little more reorganized i

2313
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,480
think it would make sense where other

2314
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,159
sensory and action affordances could be

2315
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,199
plugged in

2316
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,040
but the piece that's

2317
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,000
such as like adding another pheromone so

2318
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,360
instead of just having like you know

2319
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,000
pheromone one through ten density like

2320
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,120
make it specific pheromone sent one

2321
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,880
and then that would allow us to go okay

2322
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,400
now let's just copy and paste pheromone

2323
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,760
sent two

2324
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,679
and then we could have

2325
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,920
um more flavors

2326
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,600
so well so what what would you make the

2327
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,520
pheromone scent to

2328
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,760
do would you make it like fairmont said

2329
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,120
one drives you to the food and if

2330
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,960
everyone send two drives you home or

2331
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,800
would you just make different decay

2332
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,239
rates or what would you do with the

2333
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,719
different fair ones

2334
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,480
one duality would be like plus and minus

2335
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,080
if there was the appropriate behavior

2336
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,440
around using them

2337
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,600
another one would be fast and slow decay

2338
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,760
which maps on to the way that ants

2339
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,199
actually use the sense with like some

2340
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,560
longer chain

2341
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,040
hydrocarbons that are longer lasting and

2342
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,320
some shorter chain ones that are

2343
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,600
volatile

2344
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,000
um another interesting cognitive model

2345
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,679
would be like there's two or three

2346
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:44,800
pheromones

2347
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,239
and then what the inference is on

2348
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,560
is the ratio

2349
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,280
and then it could be shown like you know

2350
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,760
no cheating the ant is only perceiving

2351
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,159
the ratio of these two things

2352
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,600
so that would be kind of

2353
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,040
uh

2354
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,120
it's kind of like bimetallism

2355
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,639
like you tie to the idea of a ratio

2356
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,560
rather than to just the absolute amount

2357
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,080
of one

2358
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,520
so like

2359
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,320
um

2360
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,000
it could be food could be a little sweet

2361
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,679
and a little salty or a lot sweet and a

2362
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,679
lot salty or then the inference of

2363
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,280
whether it's tasty is like whether it's

2364
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,639
balanced

2365
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,320
so then if we're thinking about the ant

2366
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,520
tasting

2367
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,159
balances in the world

2368
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,239
maybe that could help it have an

2369
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,000
internal manifold

2370
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,560
that by definition would be simpler

2371
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,639
than the state space of the pheromone

2372
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,239
densities out there in the generative

2373
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,400
process

2374
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,520
um

2375
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,000
so i i heard that there are two types of

2376
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,080
ants like that there are grease eating

2377
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,480
ants and sweet eating ants are they just

2378
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,760
like different

2379
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,040
like what is that what makes that

2380
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,120
distinction actually and like does the

2381
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,960
same ant really eat those things or

2382
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,880
what's up with that

2383
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,800
um

2384
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,840
just reminded me of you know like uh uh

2385
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,080
evil neutral good like the

2386
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,480
classifications for characters

2387
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,280
and then what are the major macro

2388
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,280
molecules what are the nutritious

2389
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,040
molecules other than vitamins well

2390
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,920
there's like protein carbohydrates and

2391
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,679
fats lipids

2392
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,440
and

2393
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,440
different parts of the colony life cycle

2394
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,880
might use these different nutrients

2395
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,400
differently but then what are the

2396
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,480
resources that could be obtained like

2397
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,400
sweet that could come from like an extra

2398
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,719
floral nectary so like a plant that's

2399
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,440
secreting a honeydew or scale insects

2400
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,520
and the the carbohydrate-rich fluids

2401
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,280
that they secrete and ants that love

2402
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,199
sugar and pies and stuff

2403
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,719
then there's oil

2404
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,400
and then there's also like protein like

2405
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,480
there's meat ants

2406
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,760
and um

2407
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,360
the turtle ants

2408
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,800
in the in the canopy forests in some

2409
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,120
rainforests i've heard from many ant

2410
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,440
researchers like that the most effective

2411
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,800
traps

2412
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,040
use human urine

2413
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,080
and like those ants well that's high

2414
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,400
nitrogen high protein relatively

2415
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,320
speaking if you're a tiny guy

2416
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,440
so

2417
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:05,730
um

2418
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:07,600
[Music]

2419
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,679
it's interesting why some species would

2420
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,960
um

2421
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,239
prefer

2422
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,600
more or the other if you're putting on

2423
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,280
more biomass

2424
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,120
like if you're making larger colonies

2425
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,040
you probably need a lot more protein and

2426
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,159
lipids

2427
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,920
whereas if you have longer lived workers

2428
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,960
then you don't need as much lipid and

2429
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,560
protein but you might use a lot of

2430
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,320
carbohydrates

2431
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,679
so that's sort of the fun way to think

2432
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,520
about the workers like a car like you

2433
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,440
need the metal to make the car

2434
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,440
but then you only need gas it's like you

2435
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,440
need the protein and lipids to make

2436
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,560
the ants

2437
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,199
but then afterwards you really use more

2438
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,880
carbohydrates

2439
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,199
even though they probably also digest

2440
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,120
other nutrients but i think the the

2441
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,480
piece that um to connect would be like

2442
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,000
um

2443
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
find some

2444
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,280
student or person who loves

2445
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,199
meta-analysis it could be us or it could

2446
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,400
be someone else

2447
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,440
and establish like which data sets

2448
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,199
are already there

2449
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,840
what's a recent impactful and

2450
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,080
publication that already has done a lot

2451
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,239
of the meta analytic work

2452
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,560
of at least compiling data sets and

2453
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,719
there are several ants databases that

2454
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,639
have compiled behavioral data

2455
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,719
morphological data ecological data

2456
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,320
genomic data

2457
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,880
and then um

2458
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,159
how could that

2459
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,239
data format play into

2460
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,280
this

2461
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,159
model

2462
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,159
what are we going to

2463
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,280
put in

2464
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,760
and then i think uh a good step would

2465
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,120
just be to show like

2466
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,280
what does the octave inference

2467
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,520
ant model

2468
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,560
explain predict suggest

2469
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,760
that

2470
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,199
uh

2471
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,520
other first principles approaches like

2472
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,600
reinforcement learning might not

2473
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,000
perceive

2474
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,360
very nice

2475
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,480
yeah so my question about the different

2476
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,880
types of food that ants eat was was

2477
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,840
really

2478
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,199
linked to different pheromone

2479
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,320
um

2480
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,360
like types or ratios or concentrations

2481
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,440
like if i have a high preference for

2482
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,480
lipids but i'll eat sugar like

2483
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,560
you know maybe my ratio preference is

2484
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,400
different like this is another way to

2485
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
like enable different like types of ants

2486
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,360
or just to give them different

2487
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,520
preferences over the food that they eat

2488
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,600
and then where like if we initiate the

2489
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,199
same kind of agent and the same kind of

2490
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,280
food did they all like proportionately

2491
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,280
distribute or do some carbohydrate

2492
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,040
referring ants go to lipids instead of

2493
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,000
lipid preferring antibiotic

2494
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,840
carbohydrates i just wonder and like

2495
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,679
does it have to do with proximity or the

2496
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,679
number of ants that were there before or

2497
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,280
i think that all of that is is

2498
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,320
interesting and kind of relates to

2499
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,480
like this multi-goal

2500
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,320
aspect of active inference it's always

2501
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,719
really kind of difficult to

2502
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,360
i mean it's easy when we think about and

2503
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,960
get food right like so the active

2504
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,719
inference model is as easy it's

2505
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,040
manageable is what it is so it becomes

2506
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,840
computationally tractable and like

2507
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,600
mathematically tractable when it's a

2508
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,320
single type of agent with a single goal

2509
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,400
or even like two different types of

2510
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,159
agents with two different types of goals

2511
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,679
that are overlapping i mean so you can

2512
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,320
see just how but it exponentially

2513
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,080
expands when you have this kind of

2514
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,080
multi-goal

2515
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,840
thing and like some goals are like more

2516
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,000
pressing than others right like my

2517
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,320
immediate needs have to be met for me to

2518
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,159
like you know desire to go to college

2519
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,480
like i have to have food water shelter

2520
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,080
clothing etc

2521
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,719
and so these kinds of

2522
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,520
multi-goal and like prioritizing goal

2523
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,639
setups

2524
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,600
are um really interesting and

2525
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,159
a great way i think to start to

2526
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,120
approach

2527
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,800
modeling real

2528
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,679
or

2529
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,040
us

2530
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,080
or

2531
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,320
complex

2532
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,639
systems that have multiple conflicting

2533
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,199
sometimes conflicting goals

2534
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,520
another setting to transpose and explore

2535
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,520
that where there's a ton of data would

2536
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,639
be first make active beefarence with a

2537
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:14,000
honeybees so there they don't use stigma

2538
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,960
g

2539
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,280
um on the trail because they're on the

2540
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,800
wing they're flying

2541
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,920
but in the nest you could have like us

2542
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,760
in the hive as it were you could have a

2543
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,400
special dance floor and so that is where

2544
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,000
maybe like a active inference

2545
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,040
communication model could come into play

2546
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:31,920
so

2547
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,920
that this would be less on the stigmargy

2548
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,480
side but more on like the multi-agent

2549
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,040
distributed communication side so flip

2550
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,280
out the trail um

2551
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,920
modification with a symbolic waggle

2552
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,960
dance

2553
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,120
whether it actually does a waggle dance

2554
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,679
or whether we just say okay there was a

2555
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,360
waggle dance that occurred and it had

2556
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,760
this precision and these estimates

2557
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,040
then

2558
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,679
honeybees are well studied for making

2559
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:00,480
the trade-offs between foraging for

2560
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,040
nectar carbohydrate pollen which has

2561
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,760
like lipid and protein and water

2562
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,960
and

2563
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,639
a lot of work on like

2564
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,480
is it that um

2565
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,719
a hundred percent of the variance in

2566
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,800
that foraging outcome being different is

2567
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,040
about the needs of the colony and all

2568
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,560
workers respond to the needs of the

2569
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,679
colony

2570
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:20,880
is it that

2571
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,040
the workers have their own nest mate

2572
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,639
level preferences

2573
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,400
and then the colony outcome just is what

2574
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,920
it is or is it somewhere in between

2575
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,199
where there's preferences that differ

2576
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,520
between workers maybe as a function of

2577
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,679
their genetic backgrounds but then the

2578
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,600
colony outcomes are also in feedback

2579
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,400
with them

2580
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,560
so that could be um a case

2581
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,159
and i think this kind of takes us back

2582
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:41,360
to um

2583
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,000
to slide eight which is like when we

2584
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,120
have

2585
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,360
the systems lined up

2586
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,199
and we understand their similarities and

2587
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,120
differences

2588
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,120
then

2589
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,840
we'll be able to transpose

2590
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,000
across different systems

2591
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,159
in a really interesting way and then ask

2592
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,520
um it's kind of like biomimicry on

2593
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,120
behavioral systems

2594
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,800
is this more like a honeybee situation

2595
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,719
where people are exchanging information

2596
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,400
and then going their own way

2597
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,800
or is this more like a trail stigmergy

2598
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,239
situation

2599
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,000
and um

2600
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,880
so like there's going to be some

2601
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,600
early work transposing into these major

2602
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,920
different domains like again this was

2603
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,080
the first paper that transposed active

2604
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,400
inference and included stigma g although

2605
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,199
that had been discussed by axel constant

2606
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,480
and others

2607
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,040
regarding ecology it had always been

2608
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,199
qualitatively a part of the discussion

2609
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,280
that niche modification was relevant and

2610
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,040
that agents were able to be in feedback

2611
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,800
with their surroundings

2612
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,400
and then it went from the natural

2613
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,679
language

2614
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,080
through the formalism to the code and

2615
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,480
then now it can feed back change how we

2616
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,280
think and write and speak and then we'll

2617
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,560
transpose into a few of these major

2618
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,880
domains start to sub-specify into

2619
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,840
situations and it'll be very

2620
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,360
cool so it's super interesting about

2621
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,560
like the um communication versus like

2622
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,000
the trail like which of these like

2623
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,280
and i just wonder what you think like

2624
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,119
as humans

2625
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:14,719
which are we more like are we more like

2626
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:16,800
bees or are we more like ants like do we

2627
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,320
communicate and then go on our separate

2628
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,040
way or do we just like follow in a row

2629
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,840
like

2630
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,679
where do you think we're at

2631
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,040
in the b ant trajectory

2632
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,639
it makes me think of a drive that we

2633
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,000
went on this weekend and um there was

2634
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,920
the street signs and then there was a

2635
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,280
big field and then there was the

2636
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,119
pleasure path that was cutting the

2637
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,199
hypotenuse across the field so it was

2638
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,679
like a big block with an empty field in

2639
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:45,360
it and so people were walking and so

2640
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,239
they were making that trail and so there

2641
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,490
was this juxtaposition between the um

2642
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:53,199
[Music]

2643
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:56,480
societally imposed and scaffold

2644
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,560
infrastructure like the streets and the

2645
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,880
symbolic signs you know the stop sign

2646
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,239
here and this is where this street and

2647
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,320
that street intersect and then there's

2648
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,520
the people

2649
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,080
who were moving on that landscape and

2650
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,520
then even if you don't see any other

2651
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,119
people at that moment it's their

2652
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,360
stigmargy with the trail

2653
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,520
and so it is an interesting question and

2654
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,040
it's almost like we have symbolic rules

2655
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,760
and scaffolds like law and norms and

2656
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,719
culture

2657
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,719
that are even though there's ways to

2658
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,400
think about those as stigma energy

2659
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,520
themselves

2660
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,520
for the agent level that's more like a

2661
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,920
symbolic communication

2662
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,960
and then

2663
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,199
it's like the ant stigma g is like

2664
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,520
blurring the lines

2665
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,880
that the symbolism provides for us

2666
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,679
so

2667
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,440
i think there's um

2668
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,600
there's some components of both plus

2669
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,159
other insects

2670
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,840
maybe not insects too but that's quite

2671
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,199
contentious so that that brings me back

2672
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,800
to like the concept of of

2673
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,040
intergenerational sigmoidy but but

2674
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,119
really like maybe my question was not

2675
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,600
like phrased correctly like sure we

2676
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,840
leave some stigmatic traces as humans

2677
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,480
for like the the next generations but

2678
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,320
but also like we leave

2679
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,199
like sigmoidy for strangers right like

2680
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,520
like so i wonder if like and i know that

2681
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,520
the ant colonies like the pheromones are

2682
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,280
different and the different species of

2683
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,560
ant they're different and so i wonder um

2684
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,639
maybe is it like the fact that total

2685
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:25,280
strangers can go you know searching for

2686
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,520
um collective intelligence or collective

2687
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,360
behavior or something like that on the

2688
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,679
internet and come to the same result or

2689
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,199
certain like total strangers see the

2690
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,440
stop sign and know that there's some

2691
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,679
sort of behavioral norm that's supposed

2692
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,239
to be enacted just by seeing the signs

2693
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,920
in the street and so we leave this like

2694
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,480
you know we do this externalization of

2695
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,679
of cognition a lot as humans and so

2696
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,760
this is what i want to see in the animal

2697
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,920
kingdom like like i want to see traces

2698
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,960
of like can strange animals say like oh

2699
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,040
i see a rock stack i know the trail goes

2700
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,800
this way right like like does that

2701
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,480
happen in the animal kingdom or is that

2702
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,199
what's maybe uniquely human

2703
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:04,639
good question

2704
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,199
and i think this is why we can study

2705
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:10,480
these systems and gain insight without

2706
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,480
naively copying their strategies or

2707
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,400
thinking that we must be

2708
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,679
them or they must be us because

2709
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:18,560
our

2710
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,400
whatever it is that we're doing it's at

2711
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,040
the intersection of like stigma g and

2712
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,800
cumulative culture modification and

2713
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:25,920
symbolism

2714
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,639
so in a way the ant and the be

2715
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:31,679
foraging paradigms not no hashtag not

2716
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,280
all ants because some don't do pheromone

2717
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,480
trails etc but one extreme

2718
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:40,400
is like the syntax of the foraging trail

2719
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,719
and there's no symbolic communication

2720
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,560
it's just stigma g

2721
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,880
and then the other extreme is

2722
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,760
no stigmatic modification there's no

2723
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,400
trace left in the environment at all

2724
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,480
there's just transient symbolic

2725
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,679
communication

2726
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,119
so it's this continuum from the

2727
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,800
transient symbolic

2728
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,480
like i'm going to pass you a message and

2729
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,480
then you're going to be off on your way

2730
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,360
to

2731
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,880
the stigmatic and often sub symbolic

2732
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,440
like the path crossing that field

2733
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,719
it isn't directly a symbol

2734
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,320
saying walk on me

2735
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,040
but

2736
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,000
it isn't

2737
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
in affordance we perceive it as an

2738
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,560
ecological affordance but it doesn't

2739
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,400
have it that's not what it symbolizes

2740
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,159
that's what it is and that's how we

2741
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:27,840
enact it um so like we could have some

2742
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,840
types of active inference models that

2743
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,040
highlight

2744
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,400
that um

2745
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,719
transient among agents

2746
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,199
meaning based communication

2747
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,600
versus models that um

2748
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,239
don't need to take on any grandiose

2749
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,920
hermeneutic

2750
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,199
communication and what does

2751
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:47,280
communication mean and how does thinking

2752
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,960
through other minds happen

2753
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,400
we just

2754
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,639
look to the ground and about how agents

2755
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,000
respond to their niche which is a

2756
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,679
combination of biotic and abiotic

2757
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,560
nice

2758
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,239
fun times

2759
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:05,520
yeah just any final thoughts or or any

2760
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,679
anything else for me i've given all my

2761
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,080
all my thoughts out i think oh me too

2762
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,719
over the years but thanks for um pushing

2763
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,520
for this paper for 29

2764
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,320
and uh 30 is gonna be

2765
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,440
hot on the heels slash

2766
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,679
abdomen of this paper because i think

2767
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:26,080
we're going to be able to operationalize

2768
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,600
a lot of the discussions that we had

2769
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,920
about extended cognition i know it's

2770
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,000
also going to bring back

2771
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,520
what we talked about with the

2772
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,000
definitions of a self and individuality

2773
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,920
so

2774
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,119
another one in the books on to our third

2775
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,239
decade

2776
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,920
of um

2777
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,239
papers on the live stream

2778
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:47,280
and uh

2779
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,400
yeah i hope people found it interesting

2780
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,920
as with other

2781
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,320
papers except this is one where

2782
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:55,679
hopefully they can

2783
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,199
get in touch with the authors and

2784
01:40:57,199 --> 01:41:00,159
understand that it's a totally open area

2785
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:03,199
and a collaborative one too

2786
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,880
awesome well thanks for giving us your

2787
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,520
time and and always giving us your time

2788
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,360
thanks youtube luke so

2789
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,320
um i'll flip to the closing slide

2790
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,520
that's

2791
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,679
what we can still think about

2792
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:17,119
and uh

2793
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:21,199
awesome see everyone around next time
