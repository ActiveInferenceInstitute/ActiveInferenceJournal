"Speaker 1","00;00;09;00","00;00;42;01","Welcome to the Active Inference Lab Livestream number 29.2 today is September 28th 2021, and we will be discussing the paper Active Imprint An Active Inference Framework for Ant Colony Behavior And today we are here with the first author, Daniel Freeman. The Active Inference Lab is the participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us that all of the links down here."
"Speaker 1","00;00;43;01","00;01;11;22","This is a recorded and an archived livestream so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve upon our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we will be following good video etiquette for Livestream here at the short link, you can find all of the upcoming and recent livestream that we have done, so please get in touch if you would like to participate today."
"Speaker 1","00;01;11;22","00;01;38;11","Our goal is to discuss the paper that we just said Active in France and we are going to do some different papers in the upcoming weeks. Like I said, get in touch if you want to participate. So we're just going to introduce ourselves and go through a little bit of warming up. I am Blue Knight. I'm an independent research consultant from New Mexico and I'll pass it to Dan."
"Speaker 2","00;01;39;24","00;02;12;27","Banks for facilitating. I'm Daniel and I'm a researcher in California. And I guess I'll start with what I'm excited about today. I was just excited that in 29 one we could sort of forage out in a lot of different directions and make some initial trails to a few different ideas. And then now in the 29 to maybe we can develop some of those threads, splash trails and maybe get some of it down in writing so it should look pretty good."
"Speaker 1","00;02;14;16","00;02;34;15","Nice. Yeah, I'm excited too. There are some questions that I've been mulling over over the last week and so I'm kind of excited to delve into those and also into the code for the model today. If we have time being that it's just us, I think we might get there. Well, maybe about maybe more people on time."
"Speaker 2","00;02;35;06","00;02;40;04","There might be a little bit of lag. Not sure so you might want to check that."
"Speaker 1","00;02;41;08","00;02;41;18","OK."
"Speaker 3","00;02;42;05","00;02;42;13","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;02;46;04","00;03;00;06","Enough. It's been so the big question of this paper is how can a group of active inference agents file complex reporting problems?"
"Speaker 2","00;03;01;14","00;03;31;22","Well, first one I'll say is if you're recording it locally as well as streaming, then we can always upload a high quality recording. And it does sort of bear on this big question. This is a quote from the paper, and that's sort of the big question in collective behavioral studies, which is OK, if greeting Stephen, if each agent, if each subunit of the system had all the information needed well, then there wouldn't necessarily be a challenge for coordination."
"Speaker 2","00;03;31;25","00;03;51;14","It's like if if it already knew what to do, then it would be a challenge. But how do systems make adaptive decisions when subunits don't have all the information? So in the case of an online team, each person's only seeing a different part of the picture. In the case, the answers are each in a little bit different part of their niche."
"Speaker 2","00;03;51;25","00;04;08;23","But those are some of the similarities, which is that each nest is only going to be experiencing its local environments and we want to have colonies that work. So welcome, Stephen. Maybe you can say hello while Blue is just testing some stuff out oh great."
"Speaker 3","00;04;08;23","00;04;38;17","Yeah, good morning. Well, in North America anyway. Yeah, I'm based in Toronto and I work with communities and so a systemic coaching approaches and I'm very interested in how active inference scales in different ways. So even though this is about small things, it's also about lots of small 21. This is."
"Speaker 2","00;04;39;10","00;04;43;09","Well your audio also just had some weird Steve maybe talk directly into it."
"Speaker 3","00;04;43;28","00;04;47;18","Oh OK. Is that better? Yeah. Oh OK."
"Speaker 2","00;04;47;23","00;05;18;25","But you mentioned scaling in the small the 11 funny thought. Again, this picture is from the ants that I was studying for five years in Arizona. And yes, the nest mate looks like a tiny guy, like a small ant. But then we know that these colonies can live for 20, 30 plus years. There are also several meters under the ground and they weigh dozens of kilograms."
"Speaker 2","00;05;19;06","00;05;25;26","So then I'm thinking, OK, it's a similar age, weight and height to myself and it's obvious."
"Speaker 1","00;05;25;29","00;05;28;27","But let's see, how is that? Is it any better?"
"Speaker 2","00;05;30;04","00;05;31;25","It still is not doing anything."
"Speaker 1","00;05;32;07","00;05;35;14","I just open it but if it's not, yeah, then it's OK."
"Speaker 2","00;05;35;14","00;05;40;09","Now it's just the slides or just a just so it looks like it's working now."
"Speaker 1","00;05;40;21","00;05;44;15","OK, yeah. It's the slides open also. It just looks too much."
"Speaker 2","00;05;45;04","00;05;52;09","Yeah. Yeah. Welcome back, everybody. Fun times. The show goes on, foraging never stops."
"Speaker 1","00;05;52;15","00;06;19;10","So and Stephen will be joining us hopefully if he's having other issues. Also, it's a good day for technical mishaps. We're having rainy weather in New Mexico, which is never, ever happens. The all the answer underground hiding and the Internet does not operate, apparently. This is so. All right. So speaking of multi scale integration and and the crux of things as happens in ants and in the ant colony."
"Speaker 1","00;06;20;18","00;06;40;06","So we talked about making this table last time. And so here like what how is each system related to the agent the needs, the interaction and stigma? B So we started this this table. Do you want to maybe take us through what you've started here, Daniel?"
"Speaker 2","00;06;40;25","00;06;47;10","Yeah, see if you can get the slides again because it's not going to be visible at all on the stream."
"Speaker 1","00;06;47;25","00;06;48;24","Oh, I can also."
"Speaker 2","00;06;48;24","00;06;49;08","Said, yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;06;49;21","00;06;51;19","I can switch that. We also do that."
"Speaker 2","00;06;52;22","00;07;23;02","So a lot of informal analogies and connections were being drawn among different systems. And that's kind of what complexity and system thinking and active inference is about, like finding patterns across systems. So maybe there's other ways to break it up, but at least one way we could at least start to classify and find similarities and differences between different systems would be this way with the columns."
"Speaker 2","00;07;23;02","00;07;52;01","So we have the system of interest like the ant colony as a system of interest. Then we can think about what is the agents level, what is the sub unit level, and that might be the level where the active inference agent is being specified. We then have the niche that the agent is operating in. So that's the generative process that's presenting observations or outcomes to the agents, which is embodying a generative model."
"Speaker 2","00;07;52;11","00;08;21;29","So that's related to this generative process versus generative model distinction. The process is the the process actually outputs the like temperature or the observations, whereas the generative model is a model of the process. And then there's two kinds of interactions that are possible. So they're sort of a transient interaction that might be among agents. Welcome back, Steven. There's the transient interactions among agents."
"Speaker 2","00;08;22;18","00;09;07;11","And in the case of the agents, that's like an internal contact. And then there's the stick magick interactions where there's a modification of the niche. And so sometimes it helps to think about these interactions among agents that are without memory as being like the transient horizontal interactions, like the common example of the bird flock. Those are the birds looking at each other, their interactions among agents that modify the likelihood of agents doing certain future behaviors, but they don't leave a trace on the environments and that can be contrasted with stick magick or niche modification behaviors, which are defined by being the ones that do leave a trace on the environment."
"Speaker 2","00;09;07;26","00;09;37;19","So maybe we'll explore different sections today, but we can always say, OK, let's return to Slide eight and let's add a row. What's the system of interest let's add a column or let's fill in some columns. So, so far we have ant colony brain and Internet slash computer, ABC's GEB, the systems that matter. Steven, what would be a fun system to throw into this mix and to look for parallelism among."
"Speaker 1","00;09;43;20","00;09;44;24","We can't the."
"Speaker 2","00;09;49;06","00;09;54;28","We still don't hear you, Stephen. Yeah, you're making phones. Definitely not working. OK."
"Speaker 1","00;09;58;03","00;10;30;00","So I've started filling in for brain and you know it all really is so dependent on what the what level you want to evaluate right so you know on one level there's like the little sub regions of the brain and you took us through I think in the dog zero really a very nice example for ants that has been kind of done describing the different like organize there are some structures within the brain because definitely there are structures that all have different functions like the cerebellum has motor function primarily."
"Speaker 1","00;10;30;00","00;11;00;14","And you know the cortex is like higher level thought and and so there's all these different sub regions of the brain. But then also at the cellular level, there are interactions, you know, that span those regions that are from, you know, the cellular cellular level and what is the know what the nations or the interaction, you know, might be different depending on like the the cells are responsible for driving the interactions between the organ."
"Speaker 1","00;11;01;11","00;11;29;19","So I'm not sure what the level of of of the level of analysis the right one is and then dignity and modification I think about, you know, long term potentiation and like adaptation in the brain is very maybe not stigmatic but it's a it's a really important modification. I think and sensitivity to different neurotransmitters and things like that."
"Speaker 2","00;11;30;18","00;11;50;27","Blue, it's still really lagging. Can you just stop streaming and I'm going to pick it up on my side. OK, go for it. So stop the streaming then just let me know when you did it. Let's see how this OK, let's see what happens. This could be very, very interesting. To do the live hack like this. OK, YouTube, we're going to wait for it to catch up."
"Speaker 2","00;11;50;27","00;12;02;01","Sorry, everybody. So it goes, OK, wow. We just got swamped. Live stream feeds. So we're back in the game."
"Speaker 1","00;12;04;04","00;12;08;06","No level of preparation can prepare for like the Internet, I suppose."
"Speaker 2","00;12;08;14","00;12;24;17","No. And it's like half the time, a mile and a half the time on your side. But if you're watching live, definitely add any comments or questions because we're just going to be kind of exploring and chilling today, but continue to facilitate I'll just be broadcaster rule. OK."
"Speaker 1","00;12;25;19","00;12;52;12","Cool. So the yeah, we were talking about the brain and the interaction and the stigma, right? And then for the Internet, I don't know. What do you think is the is that agent or what is the subunit of the Internet like? Is it each server or where do you have the subunit up? Daniel, I see what you guys think mm."
"Speaker 3","00;12;53;19","00;13;02;06","Well, so this this sort of ties into what they might say in, you know, unit of analysis as well. But that's not necessarily quite the same thing as an agent."
"Speaker 3","00;13;04;16","00;13;34;20","I suppose on the internet. Ultimately, it's the it's whoever's making who's at whoever's triggering choices in the system, which is normally a yeah, it's normally a person interacting with the screen in some way."
"Speaker 2","00;13;37;23","00;14;07;01","I think the overwhelming amount of interactions on the internet are probably not human driven because any human interaction is going to trigger truly a vast number of communications among other systems inside of the computer and probably remotely so maybe and I think this is one of the unique challenges, but also interesting areas, it's like the Internet is a cyber physical system."
"Speaker 2","00;14;07;11","00;14;37;12","So we could have one model where the agent like the sub unit are physical devices. So we kind of draw the blanket we focus on the partitioning around a physical object like Internet of Things. We have partitioning around things we could also have a human centered partitioning, so partitioning around humans, but then there's a lot of gray space in between the humans, a lot of links that aren't human between the human links."
"Speaker 2","00;14;38;04","00;14;58;20","And then another approach might be purely informational or computational. And seeing the Asians as software agents but I think that interface where how will we talk about the software and the hardware agents coming together is where the Internet of Things is developing and what it's coming to mean."
"Speaker 3","00;15;00;05","00;15;26;05","I mean, one thing you could think about there also is when, say, for instance, I make a choice or I do something on the Internet and there's a whole load of there's a cascade of other things going on through the different routers and the servers, et cetera, is that more like the pheromones trail that sort of dissipates off into the distance leaving records and how much of it's like other agents initiating?"
"Speaker 3","00;15;26;07","00;16;16;16","Because often, you know, every time you do something to some extent, database is my update however, and this may change to what extent that is alive is another question is, is is it sort of a computational form of niche modification that's going on in most cases in terms of the Internet but what they're trying to do because it's that idea of the battle for your mind, they're trying to make it so that in most cases that the user has less has less thinking to do in terms of the choices they make and the design."
"Speaker 3","00;16;16;27","00;16;40;18","There's this there's a great book in web design called Don't Make Me Think. And the idea is that you go somewhere. It's almost obvious what you need to do. A bit like when you pick up a newspaper, you know that you're just going to turn the pages. So how how much of all this architecture in the background is to support giving you what you expect to be given when you expect to be given it?"
"Speaker 3","00;16;42;13","00;16;58;08","And how much of it is which, you know, how much of it is actually what you might term an agent with with some sort of teleology Well, and."
"Speaker 2","00;16;58;18","00;17;31;29","You mentioned expectation there, and expectation is something that agents engage in. So maybe it's even we can keep on forking this off. But what do we know from the active inference ontology? What defines an agent's external states blanket states, internal generative model? What does the internal generative model entail? Well, it includes predictions about external states it includes policy affordances, it includes preferences and includes expectations over some of these things as well."
"Speaker 2","00;17;32;16","00;17;56;25","So when we say agents we can be referring to the whole Markov decision process or other ways of viewing the active agents. And then the expectations of the agents are really important because it's not just that psychologically it's going to determine whether the agent likes it or not, but it helps us connect these systems like the air quality and subunits of the brain."
"Speaker 2","00;17;57;06","00;18;20;13","So we don't need to use only the psychological interpretation, but then we can have a psychological interpretation where one seems warranted given the system of interests. But also we're going to be able to compare that and look for similar functional features in systems without getting into just some sort of abstract debate over whether it's live or whether its certain feels a certain way to be that system."
"Speaker 1","00;18;21;23","00;18;51;19","So, Daniel, you brought up the generative model and I was just going to bring it up right before this. And so I've been really thinking a lot about the generative model and like where is the generative model which is like I think probably my favorite contest episode that I've ever covered is going to come out next week and the talks about like the location of the generative model and so, you know, it doesn't necessarily have to have a location because it's like software, right?"
"Speaker 1","00;18;51;29","00;19;13;04","So I mean, yeah, there's like a copy of the software running on disk. Maybe, maybe it's in the cloud, but it doesn't matter because it's the program that's running. So the location of the program is, is almost not even relevant. So I just I think about like what is the generative model of the Internet, right? Like what does that look like?"
"Speaker 2","00;19;16;20","00;19;54;10","A great question in activism for cyber physical systems and embodiment in ENCODE meant maybe there's some analogous term to what would describe what we call for E in the embodied, extended and cultured, et cetera, for digital systems because they do have importance attributes that in a strange way almost suggest that some of these are some of these features that are suggested to be quintessentially related to having a body."
"Speaker 2","00;19;54;10","00;19;58;07","And embodiments also exist for software."
"Speaker 3","00;20;01;08","00;20;31;20","In something on to that is say we think about rather than and you've got the active inference generative model but say you've got an active niche modification algorithm. So I is still working off the agents being making choices but what's happening is so for instance you've got ABC testing happening on a on a website. So basically they send out three different campaigns with three different types of profiles."
"Speaker 3","00;20;32;02","00;21;12;10","Now the user makes choices based on how the user makes a choice. They may be across the whole of the whole market. The ABC choices might get modified in that niche but eventually maybe then actual clients get sent down certain routes. I mean, a classic case of this is also what happens with those in-store cards because I actually ended up going I didn't get go for it an interview with the next two card people in the UK once and they they do these cards that you can install and basically I think works out."
"Speaker 3","00;21;12;10","00;21;30;16","They have like a million permutations of offer that they can give you based on what your different buying options are so in a way they're kind of but they only serve you up then whatever you see one of those, right? You don't see what all the other people are getting and some of them are small changes some of them might be bigger changes."
"Speaker 3","00;21;30;29","00;21;52;24","So in some ways it's like it's still the, the, it's still like, it's like the niche is modifying to the agents adaptive behavior but the actual niche isn't necessarily doing adaptive active inference. There may be some sort of active inference in a more kind of mean, I don't know, non-living way."
"Speaker 2","00;21;53;12","00;22;34;12","And there might be we'll probably have better words and ontologically informed ways of talking about it, but there's kind of like low bar active inference or like austere active inference that is just any input output structure. It's going to be able to be fit into something like a partially observable Markov decision process. So whatever it is that the nation is doing it's emitting observations so we can model it under this certain low bar active inference versus the sort of anti dissipate of truly cognitive strategic active inference."
"Speaker 2","00;22;35;01","00;23;17;01","And also there's no reason why we can't have hybrid models where there's like active inference agents in a niche that isn't in active inference agents. So like in this ant model, the niche is just a landscape of fair densities with a random dissipation factor. So that external niche could be made very much more complicated. And the observations that it passes back to the agents could be like customized to them, and that could be calculated by an active inference niche or not."
"Speaker 2","00;23;17;15","00;23;38;25","And that's sort of the extremely interesting work of Axel Constant and others with some type of symmetry occurring with the agent in the niche jointly inferring each other, sort of like what is the niches generative model of the organism? What is the Internet's generative model of the user? So it's interesting questions."
"Speaker 1","00;23;39;22","00;24;08;24","I love that idea of symmetry, especially between the agents and the niche and its relationship or potential relationship to the kind of guy theory that the the niche has to expect or have an expectation of the organism that's going to interact with it or create it or modify it or exploit it in some way in order for there to be some kind of reciprocal interaction in there."
"Speaker 1","00;24;09;11","00;24;39;26","So super nice. Maybe we can come back to looking at this table and maybe think of other systems that might be interesting to go through and move on to some of the questions for 29.2. But wait, before we go to this one, I want to go to this one on top. So we were talking about the role of dopamine last time."
"Speaker 2","00;24;40;00","00;24;40;08","Which."
"Speaker 1","00;24;41;11","00;24;49;18","So say this is a slide a skip to a sorry. You can see."
"Speaker 3","00;24;52;12","00;24;53;13","I think it's number seven."
"Speaker 1","00;24;54;13","00;24;56;23","Yeah, number number 11."
"Speaker 3","00;24;57;14","00;24;57;21","All right."
"Speaker 2","00;24;57;27","00;24;58;07","OK."
"Speaker 1","00;24;59;15","00;25;31;28","So so we're talking about last time the role of dopamine and like influencing the affordances. And this really kind of speaks to the role of reward in a generative model. And so, you know, we talk about one of the beautiful things about active inference is it kind of changes the reward structure in the model because, you know, there's some kind of reward that's given to actually finding the food, right?"
"Speaker 1","00;25;31;28","00;26;08;02","So so there's some some reward for finances. But also and even in this model, so the reward structures has changed. Right? So there's it's not just about finding the food. And maybe this is a good opportunity to to look through the code maybe as well. But but, you know, if we think about the change in there, which structure and we place some value on the epistemic, you know, the knowledge about the model of the world so if we can build a more precise model of the world, we can also gain more food overall."
"Speaker 1","00;26;08;25","00;26;12;15","So I don't know if you guys have comments on that or."
"Speaker 2","00;26;12;26","00;26;14;24","Yes, David, it yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;26;14;24","00;26;37;14","I think also as well as built, like you say, building that model, the world becomes it's an action model. OK, so it can be what might be seen factually spurious but practically useful, you know, so it may be really useful to have some bizarre ritual about how to get on a soccer pitch and try and kick the ball."
"Speaker 3","00;26;37;14","00;26;43;21","Right. But if it does something better than what you're doing, otherwise go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;26;45;22","00;27;08;17","And I think the challenge comes with increasingly esoteric rituals. If they're not related to the actual causal structure of the world, if they work for a moment, they're not going to be adaptive, because if you're only strategy is, you know, praying to the kicking God instead of practicing it might work or it might indirectly and do some sort of outcome."
"Speaker 2","00;27;08;23","00;27;37;09","But is that a long term strategy? But agree that the generative model is including a model of action? It's not just about getting precision about how things are out there, because what ultimately matters is getting precision on our actions. And then there's sort of these two parallel paths or two intertwining paths, which is do we take a reward centered approach which is behavior dominated by reward?"
"Speaker 2","00;27;37;25","00;28;10;20","And then the other side of the reward coin is like the punishment aversion. So carrot and stick, that's sort of a sister road, two lane road. Do we pursue reward or do we avoid regret and suffering? And then the third road is this uncertainty minimization approach. So I pasted in this paper by Colombo Explanatory Pluralism and they review three prominent hypotheses of dopamine activity."
"Speaker 2","00;28;11;04","00;28;37;19","So Anhedonia, which is on pleasurable states, incentive, salience and reward prediction errors. And I think this is a really fascinating paper and it does apply to the ants context because they make a very specific system point. Talking about the role of dopamine in the mammalian brain, reviewing empirical evidence and then also pull back to the broader implications for the philosophy of science."
"Speaker 2","00;28;38;25","00;29;30;18","So they conclude that the evidence currently vindicates explanatory pluralism. In other words, these explanations do not subsume or knock out each other. There's a pluralism, there's multiple explanations that exist that capture different parts of how the system really works. The vindication implies that Grand Unified claims of the advocates of the PTB are unwarranted, but that is again. But more generally, we suggest that the form of scientific progress in the cognitive sciences is unlikely to be a single, overarching, grand unified theory, little possible indirect reference to those who claim that the value or the utility of, for example, the free energy principle or active inference is just simply that it explains everything."
"Speaker 2","00;29;30;27","00;30;07;03","I don't need to even say any more or detail where I used it or show you the code or show you that it's better than another model. The fact that this model I can fit everything into is the utility and it will subsume other models and other frameworks. Now, that's a contentious point that has to be either empirically supported or not, but it just is so interesting how dopamine is reward molecule or the other side of that coin with the punishment or as a precision molecule the empirical evidence alone are not enough to disambiguate that."
"Speaker 2","00;30;07;17","00;30;22;25","And so, you know, trust the data, let the data speak but then this is just showing us a kind of real time that our models of the world get projected as we do sense making on the experimental outcomes and it's not always as clear as it seems."
"Speaker 1","00;30;23;28","00;30;49;03","Well, you know, it just reminds me like so I mean, just from a very literal sense, if we think about dopamine as a reward for minimizing prediction error, like how much do we all like to be right? All of us. So I mean, like just just for being correct like that in it in and of itself is a huge like dopamine reward."
"Speaker 1","00;30;49;03","00;31;06;12","And I think about like I'm a super alternate. And so I geek out on things like difficult math problems or solving a Rubik's Cube or these kinds of things. And I'm just like finally when I get or even code, right? Like finally when the code runs, there's like this huge like something that you've been working on for a really long time."
"Speaker 1","00;31;06;12","00;31;18;15","It's like a huge like opening rush for me, which is why I keep going back to doing these kinds of things. But, but ultimately that's a prediction error reward. So it's interesting to think about."
"Speaker 2","00;31;19;11","00;32;04;19","And here's sort of the two ways that they're phrased, and it's somewhat subtle, but I think it gets at the difference between reinforcement learning and active inference. Is there a drive for being right? And then we prefer to be certain, or is the drive for certainty and then there's a preference over being right or being accurate. So are there situations where it actually brings us solace even though the direction of the outcome isn't what we expected or isn't what on some sense conversation, it's what we prefer, but actually the fact that we're able to have certainty outweighs the fact that the outcome went the way it went."
"Speaker 2","00;32;05;11","00;32;12;02","So and maybe there's other phrasings, too, but it's just again, which one do we put in the driver's seat, precision or reward?"
"Speaker 1","00;32;12;29","00;32;36;23","Well, so what's the difference between being certain and being correct? Like being right and being certain? Like, OK, if I'm really certain, but then that that certainty is unwarranted. Then that's when I'm wrong. But then I have this prediction error gap, right? So either way, so what's the difference really between being certain and being correct?"
"Speaker 3","00;32;37;24","00;32;56;27","Well, I think, one, if I could just jump in there, one thing that's really interesting is if everything's based on energy minimization and like you've got you've got a process, you're going to keep doing it and it's optimizing to make it. Basically, if I use less energy, I'm being more efficient, I'm being faster, I'm being smoother. So it always seems like you go through the reward."
"Speaker 3","00;32;57;08","00;33;23;19","The thing is, though, once you get into something where it's more complex or uncertain, you know, the idea and I talk about this now, actually, there's a whole area in development work and design thinking called Fail in Forward, Fail Forward. So the ideas fail fast, fail quick. But part of this is like in, you know, and I always say within ethical bounds, right?"
"Speaker 3","00;33;23;19","00;33;44;13","Because it might be great for the designer as long as it's not a community member being sort of being frustrated by this, but by it makes sense in the sense that I don't think reinforcement learning can really account for this is the benefit of doing something because it might be something which doesn't work. But now you can take from it."
"Speaker 3","00;33;44;13","00;34;05;03","It's almost like you're giving yourself a sample of the counterfactuals in a way by something going wrong, but you don't obviously we can then break it apart and say, well, there might be something right still in that, you know, and some bits which are more wrong and we can sort of do stuff with that information."
"Speaker 2","00;34;07;03","00;34;39;05","Almost like succeeding forward would be better than failing forward. I mean, failing forward has this psychological benefit of helping people recognize that it's OK to not get it right the first time and just get something on the paper and iterate from there. So the rhetoric of fail forward makes sense but having something that's even positive, like succeed forward or win forward or contribute forward or learn forward or develop forward those actually capture the functional spirit that is here."
"Speaker 2","00;34;39;17","00;35;04;21","And let's think about how that relates to Blue's question. So what's the difference between being certain and correct? So there could probably be many takes on this, but I thought of this classic science textbook you know, when they give you the science textbook the difference between accuracy and precision. Now, in many cases, though, this also is not coming from the active inference ontology."
"Speaker 2","00;35;05;01","00;35;30;06","So they may be using these terms in a slightly different way. But the point is we're getting at two complementary components of precision. And basically we can see that there's these two off diagonals, the top left and the bottom right. So high accuracy, high precision, it's like your average is on target. So that's the accuracy is where you're aiming at accuracy aim."
"Speaker 2","00;35;30;06","00;36;00;22","And then the precision is referring to the tightness of the distribution around that mean. And so you could have high accuracy like it's always at the bull's eye, but the precision is low or the uncertainty, the spread is high. You could also have like a thermometer giving you very tight readings, high precision, but it's systematically biased in a certain direction and this is just one way to get at two different aspects."
"Speaker 2","00;36;00;22","00;36;27;29","Now, we've seen this in a few different cases in variational inference as being the difference between the expectations, the means of the distributions. That's like the accuracy. And then the precision is like the variance of that distribution. So you could have a very tight distribution, the Q distribution, very tight and close to the P distribution that would be accurate and precise."
"Speaker 2","00;36;28;11","00;36;51;16","You could also have a really overfit overconfident model that is just simply quite divergence from the underlying P distribution. So which one is being optimized? Are we trying to aim for a tight scatter? And then we then second order is we want it to be in the middle or do we aim for the middle? And then the second order is we want them to be accurate."
"Speaker 3","00;36;52;17","00;37;17;18","Steven Yeah, that, that to that question is a good one and I think distinguish because often they might get conflated in many ways, but it's good to pull apart precision and accuracy because it is a, you know, you could have, you know, you could be very precise in the fuzzy set that you have and you could but it could still be fuzzy."
"Speaker 3","00;37;17;18","00;37;29;24","You could have something like you say more accurate. But it moves around a lot. And I think that that's that's an important distinction that might be lost in many cases."
"Speaker 2","00;37;30;15","00;38;01;22","And yes, and it's actually one reason why it's important to sort of stick with the uncertainty and pass the estimate, the state estimate, as well as like the uncertainty around a state estimate. Pass that through because if you collapse the uncertainty and you treat all estimates as being equally precise, there's this whole dimension of the data that has been dropped."
"Speaker 2","00;38;02;17","00;38;33;10","For example, in gene expression analysis, sometimes there's uncertainty over whether a gene is differentially expressed or not, like it has a distribution and you pick some cutoff. But then sometimes people take the genes on one side of that line and then they just move forward with them. Like these are the differentially expressed genes as if it was a discrete categorization that take a continuum and then describes it, which makes certain kinds of analyzes really simple or straightforward, but a whole aspect of the variability of the data has been completely crunched out."
"Speaker 2","00;38;33;27","00;38;34;08","Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;38;35;28","00;39;12;14","Yeah, and this also then ties into scale as well. You know, you could and how much so like you mentioned, the thermometers to them, thermometer gives a fairly well fairly precise sense of the of the read in it is fairly consistent and it's average in out the average is fairly relatively accurate in terms of the average but it's not going to give you the range or the the spreads within that and that that can apply to a number of things."
"Speaker 3","00;39;12;14","00;39;45;19","And then you as you go down to less and less, if you for instance, I suppose like you would say, if someone's purely looking at one ends or one ends behavior at a time, then you you might have this sense of um, being very accurate in terms of my ends analysis, so to speak. However, at the level of the, you know, the larger colony you're, you're, you're not as accurate, you know, so there's some interesting so scale things that can't be avoided really."
"Speaker 2","00;39;46;16","00;40;20;24","Are an accurate or and or aren't precise then estimates. So it's almost like maybe we could think of them as being high accuracy but low precision like let's just imagine what that would be like for the colony. So each forager is in the neighborhood of making adequate foraging decisions, but there's a lot of noise around that. So over thousands of interactions and foraging trips, you're going to end up getting a lot of your points in the middle."
"Speaker 2","00;40;21;08","00;40;55;08","So it's cheap because it's lower precision. So you can have simpler subunits, but it's centered around the target. Whereas if you have it centered over something that's not the target, it's going to be sub optimally adaptive for the colony. But I think ants just show that it's not about making every single action perfectly the right one. It's about being right more often than not and then just doing it many, many, many times, which is related to that sort of develop slash fails to succeed forward."
"Speaker 1","00;40;57;06","00;40;59;06","So think I'm sorry. Go ahead, Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;40;59;22","00;41;22;09","Just just one thing. I think this is also useful just in the sense of and it's almost implicit with the agent base modeling approaches that get used in biology. But it's quite interesting in the sense that that brings in that into a subjective piece. What are these ants trying to do, for instance? How are they trying to organize what's going on rather than the first person perspective?"
"Speaker 3","00;41;22;09","00;41;55;19","I what do I see? What's my perspective on the end as an observer, which might be more psychological in our world? Or what is it that I see the group doing on average like the temperature. But when you start to get into agent based approaches it, it does allow this second person stuff to happen, which is really I know in psychology is the missing piece really in a lot of cases."
"Speaker 3","00;41;56;01","00;42;19;22","So you know, how this how this in a way also ties into thinking about agents rather than thinking about what I see someone or something doing from the outside and inferring from their behaviors externally and qualitatively sets up a different type of experiment or modeling."
"Speaker 1","00;42;22;21","00;42;53;00","So I wonder about the different scales. Like as we scales from the nest MI to the colony like are are they comparable and are they asking the same question like the colony wants to know, like will there be enough food and the forager never asked that question. The forager always wants to know where is the food? Like so so they're asking very different kinds of because the forager knows as no uncertainty that its job is to find food."
"Speaker 1","00;42;53;15","00;43;22;03","And so the colony wants to have enough food, but the forebear always wants to get the food. And I wonder how this kind of asking different questions scales to things like the brain or components of the brain like or the internet and components of the Internet. Like, like what are is, is what defines a skill, whether we're asking the same question or not like or is it the goal of the system that defines the scale of the system?"
"Speaker 1","00;43;22;03","00;43;26;07","I don't know. It just made me think about even Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;43;27;09","00;43;58;22","Yeah, I mean, that's a good that's a really good point. I mean, yeah, you could if you're starting to look from the agent and you could even think about that in the brain, like, yeah, different parts of the brain are foraging information. So it's not like that. That would explain a little bit why you have these kind of parts, you know, you know, parts the, you know, different parts of the brain have different personality queries going on even in certain parts of the brain."
"Speaker 3","00;43;58;22","00;44;26;20","Get sort of put to sleep, so to speak. So rather than. Yeah, I mean, that could be that could explain. And if they're if they're each work in a way, I mean like a colony and. Yeah, who which one is some of them get to be in the driving seat and some just yeah. Some get to ask different questions or some get to sort of have their questions, influence other questions."
"Speaker 3","00;44;26;20","00;44;40;18","And some of them just get on and do their thing, if that makes sense. You're a forager basically you're going to forage, right? That's to do. But someone else, it might be like, I'm hungry, you got a forage more come."
"Speaker 2","00;44;40;29","00;45;07;04","Oh, just I rapidly assembling some image means it actually breaks down well into the chess and other fields, other serious games of tactics and strategy. So strategy. So like blue, your question. The colony was asking, do we slash? We don't know what pronouns the colony uses. Do we slash? I have enough food. It's as if it's asking that question."
"Speaker 2","00;45;07;28","00;45;41;23","Does it identify as a entity? And I or does it identify as an ensemble? We don't know. But then the estimate is asking the more tactical and action oriented question which at a first past is like, where is the food? But we know that in active inference, what matters isn't just like simply inference on the location of the food out there, but what matters is inference on our action selection for how we're going to get that food or how we're going to implement a strategy that has a good trade off of us finding it."
"Speaker 2","00;45;42;08","00;46;22;27","So like here chess meme tactics mean doing what you can with what you have. So like whatever pieces are on the board, you're going to have to do some sort of action selection for your next move. Here. Strategy requires thought, tactics require observation. So it's kind of interesting because observation is one of our terms in the ontology, like the agent is receiving observation without observations, tactics cannot be implemented and then strategies requiring mental action, just like our previous discussions in 28, the thought is actually the planning over observation strategies."
"Speaker 2","00;46;23;26","00;46;50;17","Nice double blue and there's other definitions of strategy and tactics and how they're similar or different. So that just kind of like cool that it's a way to think about maybe not just that are the levels asking different or the same questions, but might levels be defined or delineated by the difference in the questions that they ask with independent of the spatial size of the sub unit?"
"Speaker 2","00;46;51;04","00;47;11;29","The more tactical is like more agent level and then the more strategic requiring reflection or cumulative culture or mental action, that level is being implemented by higher and higher nesting by blue you're muted because you went down to just one."
"Speaker 1","00;47;13;13","00;47;14;00","Can you hear me?"
"Speaker 2","00;47;14;00","00;47;14;08","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;47;15;01","00;47;22;17","Perfect. I went on in this one so you can share the names with us because I'm missing out on the main action and I like it. Can't stand it a little bit."
"Speaker 2","00;47;24;02","00;47;24;26","Absence sorry."
"Speaker 1","00;47;29;21","00;47;59;00","So, so speaking of action and and different levels. So this is something that I've really liked and talking about over the course of the last week. This is like the next question. And on this slide 11 is this, this prospect of intergenerational stigma. And I just wonder, like, you know, as we were both foraging for names and slide content, like creating the 29.0 that we have this Internet, right?"
"Speaker 1","00;47;59;00","00;48;32;21","And so like we just Google search for whatever and information thing. I know it's not the same as maybe ants foraging for, you know, food, but, you know, roughly, didn't we come across the same kind of content and ended up like putting it in to the 29.0 in different ways and different places? And I just wanted to you know, there's this concept of intergenerational stigma that's very I and I wonder if this is human centric or if there are other examples of this in the animal kingdom and perhaps among ants."
"Speaker 1","00;48;32;21","00;48;56;16","I noted that we've talked at length about the different foraging habits, for example, of different the different foraging habits of different species, or since this is a map with different colonies. And so where do they get this habit to forge differently, like at different times of the day or whatever and it spans generations. And so is there some space left in the environment?"
"Speaker 1","00;48;56;16","00;49;21;26","Like humans, we leave traces for the next generation. I mean, we directly there's some cumulative cultural evolution transfer. And there are other species I know that teach like dolphins and teach like some foraging habits and so forth. So so what other examples do we have of this kind of inter-generational stigma? Gee, we're like, you know, we leave traces like the time capsule of, you know, like what time's like every decade?"
"Speaker 1","00;49;21;26","00;49;47;16","We open up the time capsule from, you know, whatever the previous decade was and find things like eight tracks. And then whatever things that are put in the time capsule that are just like Oh, look, we're back in the day. So I don't know. What do you think about that? Just relative to ants and relative to this intergenerational stigma and the different foraging habits of colonies from the same species good question."
"Speaker 2","00;49;48;10","00;50;21;10","And where do the priors for foraging come from? And then to what extent is their scaffolding of one nest mate in their foraging activity by older nest mates, which is actually within a generation, that's like sort of some skin cells being scaffolded by previous skin cells. It's like if you just kill all the foragers of a colony, the foragers that step into those roles will perform sub optimally."
"Speaker 2","00;50;21;10","00;51;09;22","That's actually related to colony collapse in the honeybees so there's some element of like they have an inkling of how to adapt their foraging yet also there's flexibility. I mean, it just makes me think of how we could actually study it, like putting Nest mates in different environments or having one colony and splitting it and training it a certain way and then re-integrating them and seeing if what mattered more was like the environment at that generation or whether it was possible to have AP genomic or genomic changes that sort of lock in and and shape foraging."
"Speaker 2","00;51;10;07","00;52;04;00","And then on 12, you know, I'm doing a little live meal modification like foraging is not an act but a habit with a probably misattributed Aristotle quote. So it's almost like foraging is not an act it's a policy. It's a policy over specific motor actions but yeah, the intergenerational part is very interesting and it I'm just thinking if there's other true intergenerational scaffolding, one example not in foraging is like when a leafcutter ants queen goes on her nuptial flight, she takes a little subsample of the fungal garden and uses that to start the next generation which actually I think relates to the second point."
"Speaker 2","00;52;04;01","00;52;05;06","You had about 30."
"Speaker 1","00;52;08;00","00;52;40;24","So that's super interesting. And also directly related to the microbe transfer, like you think about microbial transfer that happens like through the birth canal, like there's a difference between C-section delivered babies and babies that actually pass through the birth canal just in terms of how they're inoculated as well as breastfed babies versus formula fed babies. There's a huge like inoculation difference with your like, but just microbial flora."
"Speaker 1","00;52;41;17","00;53;05;14","And so that that is the and I wonder what you know, this speaks to the whole of science concepts like we're not just humans, we're humans inoculated with all kinds of things. And maybe ants aren't just ants they're ants. Plus that's fungal. And there's been studies on that fungus, like on the fungal composition. Is it different from colony to colony?"
"Speaker 1","00;53;06;27","00;53;08;04","Do you know? I don't know."
"Speaker 2","00;53;09;10","00;53;47;22","I know that one group in my previous lab, they they isolated nest mates and then they treated them with antibiotics and changed their microbiome. And they and others have also shown that there's a role for the microbiome in recognition. So because it modifies the smell of the ants that modifies how they recognize each other, maybe that's more like a dialect, like that's kind of how they recognize that they're in the very short time range, like in the same group or they're they're likely to be collaborative."
"Speaker 2","00;53;48;01","00;54;14;13","But I return to eight to think about what you just described about like the body and the inheritance of microbial forms. Like is there a way to refer to that? Human is the species. But then, you know, if humans contain and are multitudes, you know, there's the body, there's the other life forms, there's social interactors."
"Speaker 1","00;54;16;10","00;54;50;13","If humans of the species but the host which ties them very nicely to our next livestream, which I'm very excited about which with Matthew, since he's going to come and talk to us about the symbiosis between Squid and Vibrio Fisher and the light organ, which is something near and dear to my heart. I've worked in New Mexico, and I don't know how is this possible in right upstairs you know, you have those labs that, you know, in the lab and you guys can come and work and like share equipment sometimes."
"Speaker 1","00;54;50;13","00;55;15;10","And so I knew this lab and I love being very close. The lab of Michelle Muscogee, and she's studying to be a fish. Right. And the light organ. So I knew all these people doing directly related projects. But it's a really cool concept that, you know, maybe we're all in some form of symbiosis. And I know in mice they have sterilized mice, and the mice grow up totally neurotic, like mice lacking the microbiome."
"Speaker 1","00;55;15;10","00;55;39;29","Three mice like they're completely neurotic and have way abnormal behavior. And they've linked a lot of, you know, human behavior or human and abnormal or abnormal behavior or neuro atypical behavior to microbiome stuff as well. So so it's really interesting to think about maybe we're all Serbians in some fashion. I mean, and like we're maybe we're not the species, but we're just a host."
"Speaker 2","00;55;43;04","00;56;19;25","It reminds me of Demetrius Bolus speaking about the through others, we become ourselves. And it was situating active inference in the dialectical tradition. And you have a coming together of different pieces and they don't reduce their distinction. They actually become, especially over evolutionary time, more polarized, like the nuclear genome becomes more nuclear, the mitochondrial genome becomes more reduced in mitochondrial, or the host becomes on one trajectory and the parasite goes in the other."
"Speaker 2","00;56;20;02","00;57;14;22","They don't converge and equalize each other. They end up becoming increasingly specialized parts in a newly emergent type of system. And then these multi specified systems can be fragile because maybe now there's a failure mode of the part and then that causes the whole system to fail. So like Bucky Fuller would always talk about how all cases of biological extinction are due to over specialization might be a bit of an overstatement, but that's sort of the idea is like generalists can deal with changing niches better because they're always able to hedge their bets amidst uncertainty and average out over all the different foraging investments, whereas a specialist does really well until they don't."
"Speaker 2","00;57;15;02","00;57;39;06","But in life, it's not just like you could do well most of the time, but then you can fail sometimes living systems need to be succeeding, at least adequately all the time. If any part of your body was under producing for like 5 minutes, it would get tissue damage. So it's better to be adequate all the time rather than hyper successful."
"Speaker 2","00;57;39;06","00;57;46;01","For even almost all the time. And then what kinds of strategies are resilient among that kind of uncertainty and situation?"
"Speaker 1","00;57;48;09","00;58;17;24","So about halfway through what you were saying, I wondered when we started having a political discussion because it just really, you know, speaks to specialization or maybe polarization, which we see in societies. So like, you know, we have these different factions or different like some types or subclasses of of people and biological systems that don't become more like one another."
"Speaker 1","00;58;17;26","00;58;48;29","They become more separate from one another. And I think, you know, in the resounding echo chamber that is you know, a self similar political environment or class environment, you know, it becomes this this echo chamber that that you know, just increases our certainty, right? Increases the validity of our own model. And it makes us question the model of others."
"Speaker 1","00;58;50;05","00;59;12;25","So I wonder and this brings us back to what we're going to discuss with Matthew Sims next week. Is that right? Or is the like is the generative model becoming more similar for the Fisher I Vibrio Fisher and the Squid or is becoming more different? I just wonder."
"Speaker 2","00;59;13;04","00;59;41;18","Yep. So through interaction, do we become more similar or different what kinds of systems through interaction become more similar or different? And then how can systems be more antifragile given that relationship among the subunits versus which which failure modes are you de-risking on and which failure modes are you increasing the risk on like? So it's an interesting question."
"Speaker 2","00;59;41;18","01;00;11;08","I mean, it's not just political. It is very broad question. Blue. Let's look at the code and maybe just scan through some sections of it and then start to see in on 11 before we go to the code is just like what else could we include in an ant model? Like this was we talked about the natural history of the ant that we templated off of the Formica species in the paper, but we used one fair amount."
"Speaker 2","01;00;11;12","01;00;47;18","We didn't have interactions, you know, we had such a sparse pulling over of features of ants into our model. So that's why it's just like a introductory framework. So what, what other pieces could exist for ants? And we can kind of use the active inference breakdown of what perceptions could we add in tactile interactions, other olfactory interactions, light the intensity, the color, the polarization of light, another type of polarization, what type of cognition could we add in?"
"Speaker 2","01;00;47;29","01;01;20;25","So this was like a one step decision making ants. It just makes a decision for the next time step based upon the local thermo density what kind of cognitive processes actually exist in ants or what kind might be interesting to see in different systems like memory then what actions exist here? If we had a movements, action, affordance any of the directions and then we had sort of pheromones deposit affordance that didn't actually have a specific control policy."
"Speaker 2","01;01;20;25","01;01;50;11","It was just if that if you already touch the seed, then you deposit pheromone. If you're still looking for the seed, then you don't deposit much. So we could think what are the perceptions, cognitions and actions of the ants as currently modeled in the paper? And then where can we go with that? And then to go from that question about the simulation to meet the empirical data the other side of the table, what kinds of ant data already exist?"
"Speaker 2","01;01;50;29","01;02;16;06","There are several very fascinating databases that include genomics, gene expression, transcript, Tomek and Epigenome or EPI genomics data sets. They're sparser for ants than they are for humans and mice, but they are out there and there will be more of them in the future. What kind of behavioral data already exists? Ethology the study of animal behavior video data."
"Speaker 2","01;02;16;27","01;02;46;19","Maybe they analyzed it under a certain framework, but now it could be readdressed. And then, like RFID and QR codes, that can do semi-automated high throughput tracking so people attach RFID chips to honeybees and track their foraging activity and then we also have information on their ecology and morphology, so features of which we're not in our simulation. So this is just sort of prime looking at the code by asking like how could the code be modified?"
"Speaker 2","01;02;47;08","01;03;07;24","And then how could the world already be seen as reaching out to us with these helpful pieces of data? And then where are we going to be in the middle? Like what kind of model is going to connect the empirical data sets that do or could exist to the models that do or could exist? And then what questions are most important?"
"Speaker 2","01;03;08;08","01;03;32;19","Because we want to be asking relevant questions. And so it's better to be keeping the goals in mind as we look through everything OK, let me just re crop this window while I get the code up. Anything you would just say on the overview or like general thoughts on the kind of multi-agent simulations or foraging simulations that you've made."
"Speaker 1","01;03;34;20","01;04;18;10","Just have some questions about this simulation. Actually were some some things that I would think about to include as parameters, like in a dream simulation where we could can simulate whatever with unlimited computational power and relative world data. So I think that here I'm interested in estimate interactions. So I think that that would be something that would be interesting to model, like the different types of ants that exist, like the nursemaid and before I do is and the Queen and the producers, I can't remember we went through all the different types of estimates last time, but I would just be interested in and kind of simulating how as a colony, ants interact and function."
"Speaker 1","01;04;18;10","01;04;40;11","I know that that's like, you know very well over big and I mean, in most simulations that I've always done, it's like the same type of the same type of agent, right? So you give that agent different options but it's never like this agent doesn't forage and this agent does. I don't know. But I mean, I know that they do have different people."
"Speaker 1","01;04;40;11","01;04;46;23","They do some modeling with different types of agents. But I just wonder what the compute power is and what the validity of that is."
"Speaker 2","01;04;47;06","01;05;12;21","Yes, great. OK, so we're going to take a sort of a stepwise approach. And one thing that I think will be fun is there's people who know way more about Python and coding than both of us. For sure, including Alec Schantz and others. And then there might be others for whom they've learned about active inference or they've read a lot about it, maybe even looked at the math."
"Speaker 2","01;05;13;04","01;05;38;15","But here is going to be where we see how it looks in code. So there are these multiple languages and ways of communicating and learning by doing active inference, like natural language, math as a language, programing as a language, art as a language. Maybe there's other ways too, but at the very least, we know that we have natural language, mathematical formalisms, like the equations that we're always putting up."
"Speaker 2","01;05;38;22","01;06;14;10","And then here's the code those threads might be looking more similar or different as we start to learn more about like interactive notebooks and ways to integrate our language use of the natural kinds where the programing code. So we're going to do kind of a a step down. First, we're going to look at the config file. So the read me file in this case is not super informative, which is fine, but the config files, where are we going to start?"
"Speaker 2","01;06;14;10","01;06;30;29","That's going to tell us about like what kinds of variables and parameters matter. Then we're going to look at figure one and that's just sort of going to be like, OK, this is how you run it. And then we're going to pull back to the and stop UI and look at what functions and subroutines are actually defined inside the code."
"Speaker 2","01;06;31;22","01;06;54;01","So inside of the config file it's only three lines long, 31 lines long and it has some pretty clearly defined variables that are being set. And the idea is that all the parameters are stored in this file so that you can kind of hit play and then it will look to this config file. We'll see where that happens in a second."
"Speaker 2","01;06;54;21","01;07;24;16","And so the first block relates to if you want to add the ants in a staggered fashion, how many, how many times steps should happen between adding new ants in how many or what's the location of where the ants should begin? Next factor we can look at, I'm not exactly sure it is here. It really I'm not exactly sure where the nest factor has to do."
"Speaker 2","01;07;24;16","01;07;46;16","It might have to do with the distance of the nest but let's click on that one. The grid is the side size of the map. So here is a 40 by 40 and then here is a very interesting block. It's the focal area which is three by three. So that's the grid around each nest mate is just three cells by three cells."
"Speaker 2","01;07;47;07","01;08;07;23","And so this could be changed to, you know, like four by four or something. Like what happens when the eight has a broader range of perception than it might have for action? And that's the action map. And so those are the actions that can be undertaken relating to basically moving like down into the left or up into the right."
"Speaker 2","01;08;08;29","01;08;37;21","The food location and the size of the food are provided. Then the wall. So that specifies like within the grid what is the shape of the maze inside of the map. 24 and 25 describe the the number of discrete highest levels of pheromones that exist and then a factor that is the stochastic decay of the pheromone trail. And then here the observation states."
"Speaker 2","01;08;37;21","01;09;11;05","So like the oh in the active inference model are defined as the number of pheromones levels so in this case those are both ones, they're ten discrete models. But it's so interesting because it opens up the door for the generative process to differ from the generative model. So like the observations could be there could be three categories of observation low, medium and high and so you could still have a continuous variable or a discrete size variable in the world in the generative process."
"Speaker 2","01;09;11;18","01;09;31;17","But the generative model could be over a reduced version of that, which might be all you need to know. Maybe there's enough stochastic cities such that just knowing if you're in high, medium low tells you whether to put on a jacket or not. You know, you don't need five decimal point. So the temperature and the number of action states is also reduced to the focal size."
"Speaker 2","01;09;31;17","01;09;53;23","But just as mentioned, that could also diverge. And then the the length of the simulation I think is specified in 31. So those are some of the parameters that exist just in the base simulation, some of the degrees of freedom that do exist. And that's even before introducing these like other sorts of pieces that could exist. OK, any thoughts here before we go to figure one?"
"Speaker 1","01;09;55;05","01;10;30;21","Just like, you know, I mean, I always want to know like why I like why did you choose this or like did you play with the K factor or did you play with like the length the time? So I'm sure like maybe your viewers comments on that as well. But I just want to like I'm always curious to see like was there any like unexpected outcomes or optimal outcomes that occurred like peak like did you pick 500 times steps because that was, you know, best or that the K factor of point one because that was most real realistic or those types of things."
"Speaker 2","01;10;31;12","01;10;59;23","Good questions and I think we probably could have organized these with some sub headers and some comments a little bit more clearly. So we're going to look at how the simulation gets specified and then pull back to like what are the subroutines? So the top part of a Python program is basically pulling in and then giving nicknames to other resources that are required."
"Speaker 2","01;11;00;08","01;11;25;24","So these resources can include packages like NumPy, which is a common toolkit used for math and statistics in Python. I'm sure you can see more on that one. And then there's this, the config as the CFF. So that's what we call like C.F. dot number of observations that's going to call like this, which is defined as this, which is ten."
"Speaker 2","01;11;26;11","01;12;29;26","But of course that can be changed. So that's where the variables that are set in the config file come into play. So the header sort of introduces the, the background libraries and resources that need to be imported. Then a few parameters are defined so that you can have like a base config set and then you can also just locally define some variables like the number of initial ants is like you can define variables that are in the conflict file or you can add some new variables in and then basically the up for the observations in the length of the range of observations this runs a routine and the routine is going to be defined better"
"Speaker 2","01;12;29;26","01;12;58;07","and and stop by. But it basically says we're going to run it for that many steps, for that many starting ants, for that many maximum ants, we're going to save it. We're going to switch the location of the food and then we're going to just print some summary descriptors, like the number of round trips and then save that in a file."
"Speaker 2","01;12;59;15","01;13;37;11","So that's like sort of the interface wrapper for running a simulation and then outputting some of the descriptive statistics. And then also saving that file now air supply is 353 lines long, so it's a little bit longer but there are some parts that we could, I think, walk through. The first is that like the ants is a class of objects and it has a few routines."
"Speaker 2","01;13;38;07","01;14;03;08","It has its initiation routine which is where it's X and Y position, for example, or given the starting location. And then there's updating a forward and a backward step there's the class of the environment. So this is kind of like if you do net logo modeling, agent based modeling, you know, you have like the turtle like the agents and then the environments."
"Speaker 2","01;14;03;13","01;14;27;10","So here we're defining the agents and we're defining the environments. And the relationship between the two of them is really whether we have a stigma type, multi agent system or not. So you could have the environment influencing the behavior of agents like the sunshine is influencing the behavior of the ants, but then the ants don't modify the sunshine."
"Speaker 2","01;14;27;20","01;15;22;27","So that wouldn't be stigma. But if there's a possibility for the agents to modify the environment and for the environments to modify the probability of agent behaviors, there's some sort of bidirectional relationship then it is stigmatized. And basically some of the functions that are defined for the environments have to do with which observations are at a given smell, whether the food exists at a given cell whether the walls exist at a given cell, and then the step forward and the step backward relate to the outgoing and the homecoming trip and this is basically just doing a delta, which I think is a which is the action maps, the delta in position, and then it checks"
"Speaker 2","01;15;22;27","01;15;35;12","whether the ant is returning, which is going to be, I believe, on the step backwards side and versus the ants going forward."
"Speaker 2","01;15;37;20","01;16;03;27","Decay is a function that's also inside of environments because decay has to do with the decay of the pheromone at that cell and then the plotting has to do with just saving the file so that some of this like the gifts and the safe vic, another object type that's defined and this is really where there was the main carryover from the previous models is the Markov decision process."
"Speaker 2","01;16;04;19","01;16;36;03","So here, just like we've talked about in various contexts, like the A, B, C and D are all defined and initiated here, those are used as you'd expect. And then the MDP needs to have these functions that relate to setting and resetting certain variables and taking a step. And then I love this line to ten action inference like this is sort of the kernel."
"Speaker 2","01;16;36;20","01;17;00;21","That is where it's happening. Here's the negative expected free energy. And then there's a calculation of the negative expected energy of the negative utility calculations divided by the scale factor pretty interesting. And I don't think we experimented with modifying this scale factor. And then."
"Speaker 1","01;17;01;20","01;17;05;11","What? Can I just interrupt you? What does that scale factor do really?"
"Speaker 2","01;17;06;13","01;17;41;22","Well, it's mentioned only two times in here and I'm not exactly sure what it does here. I think that when you're comparing relative policies, as long as you're dividing them all by the same scale factor, it shouldn't change the relative preference for different policies if they're all being scaled down by the same level. So I'm not sure why the calculation exists this way."
"Speaker 1","01;17;44;19","01;17;54;00","Because, I mean, it makes sense that they're all like, whatever you scale it by something, maybe it's just to make the numbers more manageable in this yes."
"Speaker 2","01;17;54;19","01;18;30;26","But well, let's definitely think about that. And then yeah, we could get more explanation from Alec, but the negative expected free energies get sort of OK, well, OK. One possible option would be this is like over observations. So we know that the observations are descriptives between one and ten. So if we divide by ten, maybe we're going from like a one to ten scale to a zero to one scale."
"Speaker 2","01;18;31;18","01;19;06;06","Which then lets us interpret more cleanly as like probabilities because the action ends up being selected based upon the soft max of the negative expected free energies. So instead of like, you know, 81 and one if you do 0.8.1, 2.1, it's really easy to then say, OK, right. 80% likelihood of choosing this action here's a colony level function related to an ant being initiated and just appearing on the map."
"Speaker 2","01;19;07;05","01;19;44;09","Plotting and saving functions and then here's the main. So a lot of times in the Python programs, there's like a lot of sort of upstream functions that are going to get called and then Main is called. And then when Main is called, that's like where the main program actually happens. So this instantiates, the environment, the ants in the pass it for the number of ants in that are to be specified that many ants are created with reset MDP is all of the image files are set to zero."
"Speaker 2","01;19;44;21","01;20;22;03","The descriptive statistics like how many completed trips and the locations are reset and then here is the time point time step based simulation. So here for each ants in the ants that exist there's going to be some calculations. This is related to the distance calculation here's adding the ants, here's switching the food and then here is checking for each ant trajectory whether it's returning or completed and then saving the file."
"Speaker 2","01;20;23;03","01;20;34;26","So again, I think there could be a lot more organization and commenting to sort of understand what these different pieces do. But yeah, I believe that's some of the main pieces."
"Speaker 1","01;20;37;18","01;20;54;08","Right are we going to move to the figures now?"
"Speaker 2","01;20;56;05","01;21;02;05","Yeah, sure. I can actually try to download the videos and I can play the videos."
"Speaker 1","01;21;02;20","01;21;06;19","Oh yeah, that's great. So yeah, I thought we were going to go switch back and forth from the code to there."
"Speaker 2","01;21;08;25","01;21;49;16","So we'll go to the paper supplemental data. Let's see if we can play it in the stream directly will it play? Oh, great, it will play. OK, so here is like the ants you'll you won't see it live, but the ants diffusing around the red ones are going out and the blue ones are coming up. So this is just as if you are watching the colony with video."
"Speaker 2","01;21;51;06","01;22;25;26","Video, too. I think we're going to add in the pheromones density. So here the brighter colors are the pheromones density. And like they're like one aren't made at home. But then it didn't. Here comes another one. It didn't sort of lock on. But now we can see there's a light ridge. It's locked on to the trail and it's going to reinforce the trail and then it seems like the food has switched because now we're seeing some pheromones getting deposited on the left side."
"Speaker 2","01;22;26;16","01;22;47;06","And then there's not as much deposition on the right side. But this is what really happens in ants. Like if there's high density, a fair amount on that top right, then an answer spending a lot of their time there, especially if they're carrying food, they might actually be reinforcing that part. So some of the videos are describing their similarities and differences in the text."
"Speaker 2","01;22;47;06","01;23;20;23","But I think the interesting one to look at would be I think six and seven so here there's here there's a preference for high pheromones density. And then I believe it's seven where the ants can lay down pheromone, but they don't have a preference for it. And so it ends up getting laid down, but then it doesn't get reinforced because they they just don't prefer it."
"Speaker 2","01;23;20;23","01;23;41;17","So they act randomly with respect to pheromones, but these are just like fun simulations and yeah, a total obvious next step, an important one would be to explore what sets of parameters certain outcomes occur within like when do they always lock in, when do they fail to lock in?"
"Speaker 2","01;23;44;11","01;23;51;00","But yeah, good supplemental info awesome."
"Speaker 2","01;23;55;06","01;23;55;16","What else?"
"Speaker 1","01;23;56;07","01;24;14;19","Yeah. So what is the next obvious step for you or where would you like to see this simulation go most? Like, what is the next if you were to, you know, have unlimited time with Alec to say like let's code x, y, z, well, what would you do?"
"Speaker 2","01;24;14;19","01;24;42;17","You first I'd probably go for the annotation and clarification because that's like where coding expertize really comes into play. And that helps other people modify and build on the code. The most when it we're a little more reorganized, I think it would make sense where other censoring action affordances could be plugged in, but the piece that sets."
"Speaker 1","01;24;42;17","01;24;43;22","Up, such as."
"Speaker 2","01;24;43;29","01;25;01;10","Like adding another pheromone. So instead of just having like, you know, pheromones one through ten density, like make it specific pheromones scent one, and then that would allow us to go, OK, now let's just copy and paste pheromones scent too. And then we could have more flavors."
"Speaker 1","01;25;01;27","01;25;15;06","So well, so well. What would you make the pheromones out to do? Would you make it like experiments that one drives into the food and pheromones them to drive you home or would you just make different decay rates? Or what would you do with the different fragrance?"
"Speaker 2","01;25;16;19","01;25;44;08","One duality would be like plus and minus if there was the appropriate behavior around using them, another one would be fast and slow decay, which maps on to the way that ants actually use the sense with like some longer chain hydrocarbons that are longer lasting and some shorter chain ones that are volatile. Um, another interesting cognitive model would be like there's two or three pheromones."
"Speaker 2","01;25;44;22","01;26;16;10","And then what the inference is on is the ratio and then it could be shown like, you know, no cheating the ants is only perceiving the ratio of these two things. So that would be kind of it's kind of like bimetallism, like you tie to the idea of a ratio rather than to just the absolute amount of one so like it could be a food, could be a little sweet and a little salty or light sweet and a lot salty."
"Speaker 2","01;26;16;10","01;26;36;22","And then the inference of whether it's tasty is like whether it's balanced. So then if we're thinking about the ant tasting balances in the world, maybe that could help it have an internal manifold does that by definition would be simpler than the state space of the pheromone densities out there in the in the generative process?"
"Speaker 1","01;26;39;14","01;26;53;20","So I heard that there are two types of ants like that. There are Greece eating ants and sweet eating ants. Are they just like different like what is that what makes that distinction actually? And like, does the same man really eat those things or what's up with that?"
"Speaker 2","01;26;55;19","01;27;27;14","OK, just reminded me of, you know, like a evil, neutral good, like the classifications for characters and then what are the major macromolecules? What are the nutritious molecules other than vitamins? Well, there's like protein carbohydrates and fats, lipids and different parts of the colony life cycle might use these different nutrients differently. But then what are the resources that could be obtained like sweet that could come from like an extra floral nectarine."
"Speaker 2","01;27;27;25","01;27;59;00","So like a plant that's secreting a honeydew or scale insects and the carbohydrate rich fluids if they secrete and ants that love sugar and pies and stuff, then there's oil and then there's also like protein, like there's meat ants and the turtle ants in the in the canopy forests in some rainforests. I've heard from many researchers like that the most effective traps use human urine and like those ants."
"Speaker 2","01;27;59;06","01;28;29;13","Well, that's high nitrogen, high protein, relatively speaking. If you're a tiny guy, so it's interesting why some species would prefer more of the other. If you're putting on more biomass, like if you're making larger colonies, you probably need a lot more protein and lipids. Whereas if you have longer lived workers, then you don't need as much lipid and protein, but you might use a lot of carbohydrates."
"Speaker 2","01;28;30;13","01;28;58;06","So that's sort of the fun way to think about the workers. Like a car, like you need the metal to make the car, but then you only need gas. So like you need the protein and lipids to make the ants, but then afterwards you really use more carbohydrates even though they probably also digest other nutrients. But I think the piece that to connect would be like find some student or person who loves meta analysis."
"Speaker 2","01;28;58;06","01;29;29;20","It could be us or it could be someone else and establish like which datasets are already there. What's a recent impact for Ants publication that already has done a lot of the meta and analytic work of at least compiling data sets. And there are several ANTS databases that have compiled behavioral data, morphological data, ecological data, genomic data, and then how could that data format play into this model?"
"Speaker 2","01;29;30;03","01;29;54;03","What are we going to put in? And then I think a good step would just be to show like what does the active inference ants model explain, predict, suggest that other first principles approaches like reinforcement learning might not perceive."
"Speaker 1","01;29;58;25","01;30;29;15","Very nice yeah. So my question about the different types of food that MS was was really relates to different experiments like types or ratios or concentrations, like if I have a high preference for lipids, but I'll eat sugar like maybe my ratio preference is different. Like this is another way to like enable different types of answer, just to give them different preferences over the food that they eat."
"Speaker 1","01;30;29;15","01;31;00;09","And then where like if we initiate with the same kind of agent in the same kind of food that they all like proportionately distribute or do some carbohydrate preference, good lipids and some of the maximum carbohydrates. I just wonder and like does it have to do with proximity or the number of ants that were there before? Or I think that all of that is, is interesting and kind of relates to like this multi goal aspect of active inference that's always really kind of difficult to I mean, it's easy when we think about and get food, right?"
"Speaker 1","01;31;00;09","01;31;25;18","Like so the active inference model is it's easy, it's manageable is what it is. So it becomes computationally tractable and like mathematically tractable when it's a single type of agent with a single bowl or even like two different types of agents with two different types of goals that are overlapping. I mean, so you can see just how it exponentially expands when you have this kind of multi goal thing."
"Speaker 1","01;31;25;18","01;32;02;00","And like some goals are like more pressing than others, right? Like my immediate needs have to be met for me to like, you know, desire to go to college. Like I have to have food, water, shelter, clothing, et cetera. And so these kind of multi goal and like prioritizing goal setups are really interesting and a great way I think to start to approach modeling real or us or complex systems that have multiple conflicting, sometimes conflicting goals."
"Speaker 2","01;32;03;07","01;32;24;27","Another setting to transpose and explore that where there's a ton of data would be first make active difference with the honeybees. So there they don't use stigma, gee on the trail because they're on the wing they're flying but in the nest you could have like us in the hive as it were, you can have a special dance floor."
"Speaker 2","01;32;25;12","01;33;14;26","And so that is where maybe like an active inference communication model could come into play so that this would be less on the stigma side but more on like the multi agent distributed communication side. So flip out the trail modification with a symbolic waggle dance, whether it actually does a waggle dance or whether we just say, OK, there was a waggle dance that occurred and it had this precision and these estimates, then honeybees are well studied for making the trade offs between foraging for nectar carbohydrate pollen, which has like lipid and protein and water and a lot of work on like is it that 100% of the variance in that foraging outcome being different is"
"Speaker 2","01;33;14;26","01;33;35;29","about the needs of the colony and all workers respond to the needs of the colony. Is it that the workers have their own nest mate level preferences and then the colony outcome just is what it is or is it somewhere in between where there's preferences that differ between workers maybe as a function of their genetic backgrounds, but then the colony outcomes are also in feedback with them."
"Speaker 2","01;33;36;13","01;34;22;22","So that could be a case. And I think this kind of takes us back to to slide eight, which is like when we have the systems lined up and we understand their similarities and differences, then we'll be able to transpose across different systems in a really interesting way and then ask it's kind of like biomimicry on behavioral systems is this more like a honey bee situation where people are exchanging information and then going their own way, or is this more like a trail stigma situation and so like there's going to be some early work transposing into these major different domains."
"Speaker 2","01;34;22;28","01;34;47;16","Like, again, this was the first paper that transposed to active inference and included stigma of GI, although that had been discussed by Axel Constant and others regarding ecology had always been qualitatively a part of the discussion that niche modification was relevant to that agents were able to be in feedback with their surroundings, and then it went from the natural language through the formalism to the code."
"Speaker 2","01;34;48;00","01;34;58;13","And then now it can feedback change how we think and write and speak, and then we'll transpose into a few of these major domains, start to sub specify into situations and it'll be very cool."
"Speaker 1","01;34;59;21","01;35;22;25","So it's super interesting about like the communication versus like the trail, like which of these like and I just wonder what you think like as humans, which are we more like, are we more like bees? Are we more like ants? Like do we communicate and then go our separate way or do we just like follow an intro? Like, where do you think we're at?"
"Speaker 1","01;35;23;22","01;35;25;23","In the bee ant trajectory."
"Speaker 2","01;35;28;26","01;35;47;10","It makes me think of a drive that we went on this weekend and there was the street signs, and then there was a big field, and then there was the pleasure path that was cutting the hypotenuse across the field. So it was like a big block with an empty field in it. And so people were walking and so they were making that trail."
"Speaker 2","01;35;47;25","01;36;15;10","And so there was this juxtaposition between the societally imposed and scaffold infrastructure, like the streets and the symbolic signs. The stop sign here, and this is where the street and that street intersect. And then there's the people who were moving on that landscape. And then even if you don't see any other people at that moment, it's their stigma with the trail and so it is an interesting question."
"Speaker 2","01;36;15;10","01;36;51;05","And it's almost like we have symbolic rules and scaffolds like law and norms and culture that are even though there's ways to think about those as stigma themselves for the agent level, that's more like a symbolic communication. And then it's like the ant stigma or g is like blurring the lines that the symbolism provides for us. So I think there's there's some components of both plus other insects, maybe not insects, too, but that's quite contentious."
"Speaker 1","01;36;51;25","01;37;18;14","So that brings me back to like the concept of intergenerational stigma. But but really like maybe my question was not like phrased correctly, like. Sure, really since stigma decreases as humans for like the next generations. But, but also like we live like stigma D for standers, right? Like, like so I wonder if like and I know that the ant colony is like the pheromones are different, the different species of man, they're different."
"Speaker 1","01;37;18;14","01;37;46;12","And so I wonder maybe is it like the fact that total strangers can go searching for collective intelligence or collective behavior or something like that on the Internet and come to the same result or certain like total strangers see the stop sign and know that there's some sort of behavioral norm that's supposed to be enacted just by seeing the signs in the street and so we leave this like, you know, we do this externalization of, of, of cognition a lot as humans."
"Speaker 1","01;37;46;12","01;38;01;27","And so this is what I want to see in the animal kingdom. Like like I want to see traces of like can strange animals see like, oh, I see a rash that I know the truck goes this way. Like, like, does that happen in the animal kingdom or is that just maybe uniquely human?"
"Speaker 2","01;38;03;07","01;38;34;03","Good question. And I think this is why we can study these systems and gain insight without naively copying their strategies or thinking that we must be them or they must be us, because our whatever it is that we're doing is at the intersection of like stigma and cumulative culture modification and symbolism. So in a way, the ants in the bee foraging paradigms not no hashtag, not all ants, because some don't do pheromone trails, et cetera."
"Speaker 2","01;38;34;09","01;39;16;23","But one extreme is like the syntax of the foraging trail and there's no symbolic communication. It's just stigma. And then the other extreme is no stigma, urging commodification. There's no trace left in the environment at all. There's just transient symbolic communication. So it's this continuum from the transient symbolic like I'm going to pass you a message and then you're going to be off on your way to the stigma, tragic and often sub symbolic, like the path crossing that field it isn't directly a symbol saying Walk on me, but it isn't in Affordance."
"Speaker 2","01;39;16;29","01;39;58;24","We perceive it as an ecological affordance, but it doesn't have it. That's not what it symbolizes. That's what it is. And that's how we and act it. So like we could have some types of active inference models that highlight that transient among agents, meaning based communication versus models that don't need to take on any grandiose hermeneutic communication. And what does communication mean and how does thinking through other minds happen We just looked at the ground and about how agents respond to their niche, which is a combination of biotic and antibiotic Nice."
"Speaker 2","01;40;00;18","01;40;00;29","Fantastic."
"Speaker 1","01;40;02;06","01;40;08;26","Yeah. Just any final thoughts or anything else? For me, I've given all my all my thoughts out, I think."
"Speaker 2","01;40;09;07","01;40;35;28","Oh, me too. Over the years. But thanks for pushing for this paper for 29 and 30 is going to be hot on the heels slash abdomen of this paper because I think we're going to be able to operationalize a lot of the discussions that we had about extended cognition. I know it's also going to bring back what we talked about with the definitions of a self and individuality."
"Speaker 2","01;40;35;29","01;41;01;27","So another one in the books onto our third decade of papers on the live stream and yeah, I hope people found it interesting. As with other papers, except this is one where hopefully they can get in touch with the authors and understand that it's a totally open area and a collaborative one too."
"Speaker 1","01;41;03;10","01;41;07;06","Awesome. Well, thanks for doing this for your time. And and always giving us your time."
"Speaker 2","01;41;07;16","01;41;30;21","Thanks, YouTube. So I'll flip to the closing slide. That's what we can still think about. And awesome. See everyone around next time. See everyone around next time. See everyone around next time. See everyone around next time. See everyone around. Next time. See everyone around next time. See everyone around next time. See everyone around. Next time. See everyone around."
"Speaker 2","01;41;30;21","01;41;33;05","Next time. See everyone around. Next time. See."
