"Speaker 1","00;00;07;14","00;00;39;08","Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is live stream number 29.0 on September 14th. Is it September 14th? Not any more. September 17. 17 at least where we're at on September 17th. 20, 21. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide."
"Speaker 1","00;00;40;04","00;01;06;25","This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams. At the short link on this slide, you can see the past, present and future live streams. And just to call your attention to the tabs on the bottom, the first tab are our regular Tuesday live streams."
"Speaker 1","00;01;06;29","00;01;26;29","So for these ones we do the dot zero contextualizing video. That's what you're watching now. And then we have a dot one and a dot to wear on two successive weeks. We try to have the authors try to have a lot of different people on a panel just talking about the paper. The guest stream is sort of a wild card slash anything goes."
"Speaker 1","00;01;26;29","00;02;05;18","We have a lot of different topics. Model streams reflect machine learning, different kinds of modeling and walkthroughs of code and the math stream is for talking about math and different formal frameworks. So if you are interested in co organizing or presenting for any of these different kinds of streams, then just get in touch with us today in Active Stream 29, we're going to be having the goal of learning and discussing this paper Active in France An Active Inference Framework for Ant Colony Behavior by Friedman, Shantz, Ramstad, Feresten and Constant."
"Speaker 1","00;02;06;05","00;02;29;19","And just like all of the other dot zero videos, this is just an introduction to some of the ideas. It's not a review or a final word, and it doesn't change too much. Even when the first or any author is on the stream, we're going to go over the keywords as well as the aims and claims abstract. All the usual things that we cover in the dot zeros."
"Speaker 1","00;02;30;01","00;02;51;11","And in the coming weeks we're going to be discussing this paper. So everybody is welcome to join from whatever area they're excited about the paper from. Just get in touch with us so we can begin with little introductions and warm ups blue. How about you can go first and then we'll pass it to the first author."
"Speaker 2","00;02;52;16","00;03;01;13","We so I'm Blue Knight and independent research consultant from New Mexico and asked to Daniel Friedman, the author of this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;03;02;10","00;03;27;07","Thanks Blue So I'm Daniel. I'm a postdoc researcher in California. And yeah, usually we have everybody except for the first author introduce themself and then the first author steps in and gives a little background on the paper. So it's fun. It's the first time that we've discussed one of my papers on the stream and we'll be talking about a bunch of different aspects of it."
"Speaker 1","00;03;27;07","00;03;56;23","And it's awesome to have you here in blue with a lot of expertize in collective behavior and a bunch of other areas. The big question that motivated not just this livestream, but this whole line of research in this paper is assuming that each agent is a quote from the paper. Assuming that each agent's best mate has only limited access to incoming information how can a group of active inference agents solve complex group foraging problems?"
"Speaker 1","00;03;57;11","00;04;37;20","So in the case of agents, that local information is going to be the ferryman density, the chemicals that it can perceive. It's local unfelt, but in the case of information foraging, it's what we see, or it's our perspective or the people who we can communicate to. And so this is a topic that's come up in many different guises, which is again, when you have a multi-agent system using active inference to model each agents, how do we think about the way that the perceptions and cognition and action of each individual active inference agents how do those compose or interact so that the group can have adaptive or interesting behavior?"
"Speaker 1","00;04;38;04","00;04;51;09","The big question of the paper and also again just a big open question, hardly one that gets answered in its finished form by the paper or by this discussion. Anything you want to add."
"Speaker 2","00;04;54;10","00;05;20;15","Only that I was really excited to actually post this paper and I've been kind of pressuring Daniel to do it for a little while, maybe three months or so since I first read it. So I picked this paper because complex behavior, complex group foraging problems, it's really linked to my interest in collective intelligence and in scaling intelligence, which is also why I'm drawn to active inference."
"Speaker 2","00;05;20;15","00;05;38;22","So I'm just curious to see your insight into ants and the deeper like, you know, when we see a paper, we see only the surface, the final product. And so it's really going to be fun to take a deep dove into the little nuanced things that kind of maybe led you to the the birth of this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;05;40;21","00;06;01;13","Great visual with sort of what's on the surface and what's beneath the surface. And in fact, foraging is such a fun task to study, not to get ahead of ourselves, but it's one of the few tasks of the ant colony that you can see outside. You just stand next to the nest entrance, just like this picture which is taken while I was doing fieldwork in Arizona."
"Speaker 1","00;06;01;25","00;06;39;00","So there where all the ants are coming in and out of this is the nest entrance. And so this species, the red harvester ant poking of Miramax, Barbie, this it's like there are ants coming in and out doing some trash work, midden work. But mostly what you see on the outside is foraging. And so what happens underneath? Well, here is this painted ants with a three yellow dots so we can take a little tracer down underneath and we can see what is happening beneath the surface of the foraging the paper is active in France and active inference framework for colony behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;06;39;10","00;07;09;06","And we read the authors previously. It was a really awesome collaboration. So thanks a lot to Alec Maxwell, Carl and Axel, who each brought really important insights here and to the main aims and claims. And then Bluey can provide any thoughts. In this paper, we develop and implement a Bayesian simulation model derived from the active inference framework that captures some of the underlying dynamics and emergent phenomena of ant colony foraging behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;07;09;29","00;07;39;09","That's what we did in the second point is by integrating the Bayesian ant colony perspective of hunt and others with stick magick regulation and the scale free formalism of active inference fields in Glazebrook. 2020, we provide an integrative framework for behavioral, ecological and evolutionary modeling in ants. Such an integrated approach could facilitate the transfer of modeling insights from ant colonies to human design systems."
"Speaker 1","00;07;40;01","00;07;40;26","And I guess back."
"Speaker 2","00;07;44;19","00;08;02;10","So cool aims and claims they weren't very forthcoming with or you guys weren't very forthcoming with the aims and claims of the paper. But I found like lots of them like nested like little gems in the paper. So this is just a couple of them. But I think that this paper was very, you know, on the bleeding edge."
"Speaker 2","00;08;02;10","00;08;10;23","We say instead of like the leading edge, cutting into some, some novel areas and making some new connections that we haven't seen before, or at least I haven't seen before."
"Speaker 1","00;08;12;03","00;08;43;23","Cool. There's what we did, which is write a simulation based upon theoretical grounding. And then there's the fields that were integrated, which was a sort of Bayesian forager, multi agents perspective stigma, which we'll talk about soon. And of course active inference. And that is going to hopefully develop the field of research and other areas that stand to learn from either the Bayesian multi-agent perspective stigma or active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;08;43;23","00;08;49;05","So that is quite a large swath. Do you want to read the first part of the abstract?"
"Speaker 2","00;08;50;15","00;09;15;15","So in this paper we introduce an active inference model of ant colony foraging behavior and to implement the model in a series of insula co experiments. Active inference is a multi scale approach to behavioral modeling that is being applied across settings in theoretical biology and ethology the ant colony is a classic case system in the function of distributed systems in terms of stigma, decision making and information sharing."
"Speaker 1","00;09;17;15","00;09;50;28","The second half of the abstract is here we specify and simulate a Markov decision process model for ant colony foraging. We investigate a well known paradigm from laboratory and colony behavioral experiments, the alternating teams paradigm to illustrate the ability of the model to recover basic colony phenomena such as trail formation after food location discovery. We conclude by outlining how the active ant colony foraging behavioral model can be extended and situated within a nested multi scale framework and systems approaches to biology."
"Speaker 1","00;09;51;02","00;10;20;23","More generally, how from that abstract do we forge ahead? That's why we have a roadmap. First, in the introduction section, we talk about Bayesian multi scale modeling and stigma, and then introduce the need and basis of an active inference model of the ant colony in the methods section, we talk about the foraging task specifically, which is the alternating teams, but that's really just a map."
"Speaker 1","00;10;20;27","00;10;44;03","It's kind of like Minecraft or SimCity, like you can specify any kind of map you want. We use an alternating teams for a few reasons, and then we talk about the active inference model for ant colony foraging specifically, we present some results and we didn't have any live ants recordings in this paper. So the results are more like schematic."
"Speaker 1","00;10;44;17","00;11;14;10","They suggest what kinds of things can be measured and be discussed for multi-agent active inference systems specifically the colonies, foraging performance and swarm coherence metrics. And then in the discussion we talk about three scales of analysis and implication for the work which is at the nest, me, the colony and the population scale. And we use those words intentionally because they're all ants."
"Speaker 1","00;11;14;21","00;11;43;07","Someone says, Oh, there's an influence on my windowsill and they mean a little six legged estimate. But if the colony is the organism, then wouldn't that be the colony and just it's a piece of tissue on your windowsill. And then we end with a concluding remark so it's a relatively sparse road map, but maybe we don't need that many signposts to get where we're going any road map comments?"
"Speaker 2","00;11;44;08","00;11;46;04","No. Good. Let's forge ahead."
"Speaker 1","00;11;47;12","00;11;48;23","Exactly. Exactly."
"Speaker 1","00;11;50;26","00;12;24;23","The keywords were ants foraging just why even continue its foraging activity? Oh, yes, that's right. Behavioral modeling, collective behavior, evo, eco devo or eco evo-devo? Different people order differently and stigma. So these are going to be key words that open many doors. So let's go into them. We'll start with sort of the grand Gaia level keyword, which is eco evo-devo."
"Speaker 1","00;12;24;23","00;12;51;29","That's just how I say it. But we might have done eco devo in the paper. Eco Evo-devo stands for Ecology, Evolution and Development So this is one way to see it with these three interacting domains. So it's like a tri disciplinary or a transdisciplinary approach that is going to just like the name would have you believe. Just like action and inference come together and act of inference."
"Speaker 1","00;12;52;12","00;13;30;23","Eco Evo-devo is going to integrate across these three fields so what's happening as organisms develop in their ecosystem and how evolution shapes that. But it's also and this is drawn from the Gilbert at all paper and a good text to read on it is the Abo Heath at all 2014 paper. It's actually a historical lineage. So those who study the history of evolutionary theory might be familiar, for example, with the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology which happened in the first half of the 1900s and integrated for example population genetics and quantitative genetics with evolution."
"Speaker 1","00;13;31;06","00;14;08;18","Well here's a cool timeline from the Gilbert paper talking about how from the 1800s with Darwin as well as antecedents moved through sequence of really important developments after the first half of the 1900. So these are post 1950s post the discovery or elucidation of the structure of the DNA molecule things like symbiosis the way that microbial interactions shape developments a lot of cool things and on the bottom here a growing awareness of beneficial symbiosis."
"Speaker 1","00;14;09;03","00;14;22;24","So eco evo-devo is referring to a historical lineage that is becoming increasingly recognized as an important integrative take on the systems that were a part of what would you have to say about eco evil."
"Speaker 2","00;14;25;02","00;14;54;01","Just that it's constantly I mean we're becoming so much more aware of the different facets that go into eco evo-devo and how interconnected and fundamentally important they are in a triad. Like for me, the clear. Like I remember being at the neuroscience meeting and I don't remember the name of the professor, but she was a toxicologist from Johns Hopkins and had been working in her field for, I don't know, like 30 years."
"Speaker 2","00;14;54;01","00;15;25;01","And this is like when they're doing the microbiome sequencing, which was maybe like 20, 12, 20, 13 somewhere around there. And so they're doing like the massive microbiome sequencing. And she got up and said, you know, we're going to have to redo all of the toxicology work that I've done my entire life. Which it just was so overwhelming and it just really blew my mind to hear such a renowned professor stand up and say, you know, we don't know what's toxic and what's not because we've not considered the whole."
"Speaker 2","00;15;25;09","00;15;46;03","And so in relation to toxicity and ecology and evolution and development, like we consider developing like, you know, of course we consider children eating lead paint and so forth. And I think we're, you know, we've looked at evolution, but but really that this the ecology of our own survival is something I think that people are just starting to to become more aware of and attuned to."
"Speaker 1","00;15;47;08","00;16;12;26","And there's a famous quote in biology by the agency, nothing in life makes sense except in the light of evolution. It's like. But does it? Nothing makes sense except in the light of developments and ecology and physics. And so on. So it's kind of like, right, we should have interpretive frameworks, whatever their English titles are, so that we can understand all the light that's being cast on the phenomena that we care about."
"Speaker 2","00;16;13;23","00;16;18;20","And I'm reminded of the Holoband, too, that Chris Fields brought up. Right? All of that."
"Speaker 1","00;16;19;17","00;16;41;24","Yes, absolutely. What are some of the ways that we can think about the phenomena we care about? Well, one of the big keywords here is collective behavior. That's one of the keywords of the paper. So here's a Louis Thomas quote. It is in our collective behavior that we are most mysterious individuals. Our collective two hashtag we were never individuals."
"Speaker 1","00;16;42;17","00;17;14;01","And here's a nice map from Wikipedia of complex systems. Some of the key terms a little fractal with complex systems and complexity itself. And then like a palette with art, we have the different key terms like systems theory and evolution. And then here's collective behavior up here. So collective behavior is one of the fundamental pillars of complexity, because collective behavior is just studying systems interacting."
"Speaker 1","00;17;14;21","00;17;16;24","What do you think about that?"
"Speaker 2","00;17;17;03","00;17;21;02","But I want to say it in the next slide."
"Speaker 1","00;17;24;13","00;17;29;12","Sounds good. What is the difference between collective behavior and collective intelligence?"
"Speaker 2","00;17;30;00","00;17;50;08","Right. And so this is something that you know, we've talked about offline, but really like when you look at collective behavior and collective intelligence and this was just a map I also pulled from Wikipedia's definition of collective intelligence and so here I mean, this is clearly framed in a human situation or is it to an open source software?"
"Speaker 2","00;17;50;08","00;18;20;10","Maybe we can talk about that but but collective intelligence, you know, it's these three branches framed in this image. It's coordination and cooperation, which both of those come into the collective behavior like play. When I think about fish schooling or like, you know, birds flocking right. This is like a behavior right, that we behave and coordinate to behave collectively for for each other's mutual benefit and for the benefit of the flock or the school or whatever."
"Speaker 2","00;18;20;25","00;18;45;26","But the only thing that's left out in this triad is cognition. And so, like, what is cognition? Is that input output or is is cognition intelligence? Or what's the difference between cognition and intelligence? So for me, there's like a very blurry boundary between what is collective behavior and what is collective intelligence. And so, I mean, we've also talked offline."
"Speaker 2","00;18;45;26","00;19;01;19","And so I just want to know, you know, my thoughts on this are evolving. And I'm curious as to maybe people that are listening to this or maybe anybody that wants to come onto our next livestream and talk about it, like if they have strong opinions on collective behavior versus collective intelligence. But I'd like to hear if you have any you know."
"Speaker 1","00;19;02;03","00;19;37;09","Overwhelming thoughts it's definitely two different perspectives on intelligence and behavior. There's sort of like some who would say that intelligent behavior it's defined by its outcome and it doesn't matter what's happening internally. And then there's sort of the possibility that intelligence could exist in the absence of behavior now, frameworks like we discussed in Livestream 28 with mental action, with mean mental and cognitive processes as themselves being action and being modeled as action in active inference framework."
"Speaker 1","00;19;37;09","00;20;04;28","That sort of blurs the distinction. But definitely that's going to be a question like is collective behavior the same thing as collective intelligence? Is intelligence simply behavior? And then something I always wondered about with collective behavior. Oh, you know, collective behavior of groups of people OK, but aren't people groups of self. So if collective doesn't mean anything as opposed to individual, then we're just talking about phenomena or behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;20;04;28","00;20;17;01","So, you know, let's drop the adjectives that don't really matter. So what are we signaling when we're talking about collective behavior as opposed to saying, yeah, I'm talking about individual groups, you know, individual crowds of humans, for example."
"Speaker 2","00;20;20;00","00;20;46;10","I definitely think that, you know, there's definitely if you can have no you can have intelligence without behavior, of course, because babies can't do anything but like lay there in bed and like observe, you know, like they just, you know, can set their fingers or something. But but there's some intelligence there that doesn't have necessarily an associated action and a tremendous amount of intelligence because they're learning and, you know, building their own model of the world."
"Speaker 2","00;20;47;01","00;21;07;01","And so what is collective and I was listening to the internal ISM, external ISM livestream, like number 5.2 for anybody who wants to go back in time and revisit. That was me. I was listening to that last night. And it's like, you know, what is the preferred level of analysis? Right, right. Like from the Nobel paper, like where do we get this, you know, preferential level diagnostic?"
"Speaker 2","00;21;07;14","00;21;20;07","And, you know, we are as individuals, collectives collect collections of human and other types of cells. So so what is this collective behavior versus collective intelligence? I don't know. It's it's something that's always mushy to me."
"Speaker 1","00;21;22;16","00;21;43;18","There's a constant perspective on that for another time. One way that we can talk about a specific type of collective behavior is by introducing this topic of stigma. So sometimes when people talk about collective behavior in the first slide of their talk, they'll say, you know, flocks of birds, and here's a group of people walking through a landscape."
"Speaker 1","00;21;43;29","00;22;11;22","And those are examples of coordination among agents. But Stigma G is actually pointing out a really specific and important different type of collective behavior. So here's from the Wikipedia describing that Stigma G was introduced by a termite biologist, Pierre Paul Gross, in the 1950s so it's a recent term, but of course people have seen this phenomena before and he defined it as stimulation of workers by the performance they have achieved."
"Speaker 1","00;22;12;04","00;22;52;25","No, not performance based benefits for jobs, but more deriving from the words mark stigma and Ergon or work like an earth, a unit of work. It captures the notion and agents actions leave signs in the environment and signs that it and other agents can sense which determine and incite their subsequent actions. So here we're not just looking at sort of interactions among subunits of the birds looking at each other or the school of fish, but actually the modification of the environment through the actions of the agents and then the ways that the environmental conditions modify how the agents behave."
"Speaker 1","00;22;53;23","00;23;23;25","So here is like the agents in feedback with the environments and what Grasso was looking at was how termites, how one termite would pick up a little clod of dirt and then put it somewhere probabilistically. And then that would change the likelihood that it picks up or puts down certain other pieces of dirt later. And so you could imagine like one termite building a nest by itself, or many happening at the same time, maybe even moving pieces of dirt in the same way."
"Speaker 1","00;23;23;25","00;23;53;02","So stigmata is actually a mechanism by which extended cognition occurs and by which cognitive processes can be scaled not just by increasing the bandwidth or the type of interactions laterally among agents, but actually by externalizing the work to marks on the environments. And in the paper that was written here, we present the first active inference type model of stigma and the first active inference model focusing on insect behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;23;53;21","00;24;16;08","So think about that. There's been a lot of navigation work in active inference, but when the mouse is moving through the maze, for example, or when the eyes are scanning over the piece of text, which are active inference models that we've seen, they don't leave traces even when there's multi-agent active inference simulations, the interactions have been lateral and the environment has been taken as fixed."
"Speaker 1","00;24;16;22","00;24;35;10","So that's why we brought eco evo in because now we're thinking about the way that agents are in feedback with their environments and each other and how stigma is used as a topic reflects that this is pretty cool. You added this second slide on stigma, so what does it show?"
"Speaker 2","00;24;36;00","00;25;10;05","I did. So this is another image that I pulled off of Wikipedia and it's taken from this is someone's PhD thesis. Stigma is a collaboration, a theoretical framework for mass collaboration. And again, it says here coordination, cooperation and collaboration as opposed to cognition. In this collective activity or collective behavior model. And one of the things that I just really thought was cool to point out was on the right side under collaboration."
"Speaker 2","00;25;10;05","00;25;41;27","OK, so collaboration is distinguished by a co-created emergent shared representation which manifests as creativity. I thought that was super interesting because creativity applies implies novelty in some way to me. And it implies like either a new use or, or, you know, developing something that's entirely new, making new connections as well as co-created emergent shared representations result in divergent production and evaluation."
"Speaker 2","00;25;42;09","00;26;08;09","So how does this co-created emergent shared representation result in divergence? I thought that this was just it was an interesting figure and all these different like components and end results are just an interesting way to think about stigma and like can we go through our environment without a trace the gross in like murder mysteries or like, I mean, how hard is it actually to not leave a trace in the environment behind you, even if it's here's or fingerprints or whatever it might be?"
"Speaker 2","00;26;08;21","00;26;24;10","So so none of us is without this leaving a mark on the environment. And what how does stigma contribute to human these constructs in which we're incredibly adept at and and how do we learn from that? The traces that are left by others."
"Speaker 1","00;26;26;13","00;27;11;17","We certainly stigma logically generated this presentation because I also drew from the 26 work of Mark Elliot and Elliot wrote many questions arise when confronted with the streamlined efficacy and apparent lack of organization and motivation of these new global enterprises like Wikipedia and others that were being mentioned in 2006, not the least of which. How does this work stick merge a collaboration provides a path assess as to how the collaborative process can jump from being untenable with numbers above 25 towards becoming a new driver in global society, with numbers well over 25,000 pre blockchain, pre bitcoin, pre whatever it is that we're going through now."
"Speaker 1","00;27;12;00","00;27;38;10","But these four tenants from 26 really say a lot which just like Blue's image reflected collaboration depends on communication and communication happens in networks. So that's kind of collective behavior one on one. That's something that you'd see in the flock of birds or the School of Fish. Collaboration is inherently composed of two components without without either of which collaboration cannot take place, social negotiation and creative output."
"Speaker 1","00;27;38;25","00;28;04;15","If there aren't lateral social interactions, there isn't an interacting group and without the creative output, then the productivity is low. So maybe systems like that can be designed, but probably not that interesting or important. This is for humans collaboration. Small groups two to 25 rely upon social negotiation to evolve and guidance process and creative output. So that's like the startup model or the small team model."
"Speaker 1","00;28;04;28","00;28;26;11","However, Eliot's proposal is that collaboration in large groups 25 to however many is dependent upon stigma. You need to have if you can have 25 or more people in a meeting and it's an hour meeting, it's like everybody can be taking notes on a shared document, everybody can be editing the wiki, everybody can be typing in the chat."
"Speaker 1","00;28;26;26","00;28;50;05","But if people are talking linearly, each person is going to only be able to speak for 2 minutes. On average, so just think about how that scales up. If you're in a thousand people working on a project, each person is only going be able to speak for a few seconds per hour. So what are the mechanisms by which instead of just lateral, ephemeral interactions among agents, how can we modify a single source of truth?"
"Speaker 1","00;28;50;27","00;29;11;07","In a sense? So that productivity can actually occur? And it's important to note that it's not that social negotiation doesn't take place when we're doing Stigma G and big groups so it's not like Wikipedia editors aren't aware of each other as social entities. It's just that, as Elliot wrote, negotiation takes a back seat in terms of the creative drafting process."
"Speaker 1","00;29;11;26","00;29;30;28","Most, if not all, stick merge wiki collaborations have discussions associated with the content being developed, but it's possible to contribute to Wikipedia dot org. For instance, without discussing what you're contributing to or creating. So that's kind of a cool insight anything else to add on? Stigma? Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;29;31;08","00;29;49;13","Just the group size is super interesting because we are like, I'm writing a paper on Central Place for doing right now. I actually like an unrelated paper, but it's interesting this large groups of humans because like we're looking at hunter gatherer societies and the formation of camps and like what did human society kind of look like way back?"
"Speaker 2","00;29;50;05","00;30;12;14","And really the estimate that's pretty agreed upon in the field is, you know, 500 people in a camp which it like, you know, it's like 100 families of five is like the upper limit and like, you know, mostly like at least maybe 250 people for a camp to maintain. Right. For it to stay cohesive, to stay bound together."
"Speaker 2","00;30;12;21","00;30;41;11","And I think it's interesting because what what was the stick magick process back in like the hunter gatherer foraging days. Like what did that look like. It's just interesting to to wonder about and think about if it's dependent on stigma. Gee, I mean like now I think about we stock rocks, right? Like if you're marking a trail like everybody's been out hiking and you see these rock stacks, it's like what are those like when you first start seeing them and then you see that there trail markers and you know, I don't have to know, like no one told me that rocks are stacked there to mark the trail."
"Speaker 2","00;30;41;17","00;30;56;09","But it's like this is a clearly human signature. Nobody else stacks rocks up. That's weird, right? And so you see these stick magick like things that are just left as traces in the environment that that could be used to guide, like large, large groups of humans across time even."
"Speaker 1","00;30;57;19","00;31;23;21","Yes. And even in the definition of stigmata, we saw marks and signs. So semiotics and bio semiotics comes into play let's get to the ants and potatoes, the you social insects, you social's a cool word. We're not going to go too much into the difference of what is you social versus other social forms. But some of the exemplar use social insects are ants."
"Speaker 1","00;31;24;06","00;31;48;13","All of the around 15,000 ants species in the world are use social. So they all live in colonies. There's no solitary ants and they live in colonies where there's you could call it a reproductive division of labor. Also honeybees. Are you social with the queen and worker distinction and termites are as well. Most bees are not you social."
"Speaker 1","00;31;48;13","00;32;09;03","So honeybees are a bit of an outlier in that respect. And just like there are you social wasps. Not all wasps are you social. And there's sort of six images here because I want to show that there's some related species like ants and bees and wasps are hymenoptera. That's an order of insects. But termites are in a totally different order, more closely related to cockroaches."
"Speaker 1","00;32;09;24","00;32;35;02","And you social insects are able to accomplish tremendous feats of stigma G and niche modification. Here's a leafcutter ant colony being excavated by tiny little humans, big colony. Here's a bee hive with honey in the cells and the amazing geometry that they can construct or that they can work with once constructed by humans. And also very large nests for termites."
"Speaker 1","00;32;35;09","00;33;04;02","So you social insects are really cool. How do they do what they do? Well, I wanted to pull from a few slides from my PhD work, which was on ants. So these are just some fun slides about ants. And if you want to ever jump in blue, then go for it. But this was from some early work that was at in the middle school age range, talking to people about ants."
"Speaker 1","00;33;04;28","00;33;32;11","So one of the first things about ants is there's no leader on the left side. We see the without getting into sex and gender politics, there are female reproductive is called queens usually. Again, a whole nother topic. Why and should they be called queens? There are males who are sometimes called drones. They don't play as active a role in the day to day tasks of the colony."
"Speaker 1","00;33;32;21","00;33;54;10","And then there are sterile females, which we call worker nest mates. And the image on the right shows the queen laying eggs which are being nursed and tended to by the nurse task group of workers. So she can just the queen can just pump out eggs and the nurses are taking care of it and they're also feeding the queen."
"Speaker 1","00;33;54;10","00;34;24;27","And then you have foragers outside of the nest making decisions for themself. So there's no Bluetooth, there's no long range communication, there's no hive mind need. We just have independent agents making decisions for themself locally and there's no leader ants how do they do that? How does it work without a leader? The way it works is that individual ants make probabilistic decisions about behavior based upon the rate and type of interactions they receive."
"Speaker 1","00;34;25;19","00;34;48;23","So here we can start with just this ants on the top left and it's walking along and it starts encountering a high rate of trash. And so it thinks or acts as if it thinks I should start picking up trash. Maybe the next one I see. I'm more likely to pick up encounters a piece of trash can identify that by the scent, picks it up and can continue walking until it encounters another scent."
"Speaker 1","00;34;49;01","00;35;13;27","Maybe the midden pile where there's a bunch of trash piled up, walks along for some more time before it doesn't encounter any more trash, and then reverts to a more generally poised state so this can be modified with a drift diffusion model or response threshold model. There's a lot of mathematical models of how different rate and type of interactions probabilistically can update behavioral tendencies."
"Speaker 1","00;35;14;01","00;35;25;12","But this is just a general way that we can look at how different ant behaviors play out. We can always ask, What is the individual interacting with and how are they responding to that interaction?"
"Speaker 1","00;35;27;12","00;35;52;04","Well, how do you go from just responding to interactions to adaptive behavior? The nature and what the adaptive behavior looks like is going to depend on the ecology. Again, you go Evo-devo. So here we see two possible ecologies of food. On the left is a colony where food is found sparsely, but in very clumpy piles. This is like a picnic in the Argentine."
"Speaker 1","00;35;52;05","00;36;17;17","It's in this case, it makes sense that there would be a trail that might get laid down that helps direct Nest mates to the location where another estimate previously found the food. However, there's also ants that are looking for food sources that might be mobile, like looking for live prey or maybe just scattered dead prey, but like just dead insects in the desert bringing them back."
"Speaker 1","00;36;17;29","00;36;37;25","And in those cases, you're not any more likely to find food where another estimate found it. And so in that situation, you see a lot more independent foraging activity and you don't see a fair amount trail. So just because we're talking about pheromones, there's a lot of different kinds of pheromones. There's nest marking and queen pheromones and larval pheromones."
"Speaker 1","00;36;37;29","00;37;04;10","It's not just trail for pheromones. And they're not just making these kinds of nests, though. There are ecologies that favor these types of collective algorithms. And then across ecologies, there's this lose it to find it component, which is the balance in, in the sense between explore and exploit or between pragmatic and epistemic values and goals, which we talk about in active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;37;04;25","00;37;32;15","Because if every single agent were to follow the pheromone trail, then they could exploit locally, but they would have a challenge discovering the food resources whereas if none of the ants followed the pheromone trail, then it wouldn't be informative. And so it'd be a totally different game as well. So there's this balance between following the traces that have been made before and going off and discovering new resources."
"Speaker 1","00;37;32;24","00;38;14;02","So that applies to seed foraging and also information foraging, which is kind of a parallel that we'll be looking at again and again. So those four pithy little statements there's no leader. It's about the response to interactions. And the way it looks depends on the entire ecology, the interactions with the ecology, and that across tasks, there's this lose it to find it balance between exploring, exploit those, capture a lot of the dynamics of ants the lifecycle of an individual queen is that she is also born as an egg and develops into usually a winged fertile form that's called a GuYun like a princess."
"Speaker 1","00;38;15;06","00;38;45;22","She will mate with males and found a colony. But there's other lifestyles, for example, that don't require mating with males or in which case the Queen doesn't found a colony by herself but rather breaks off with some workers. There's a lot of diversity in the ant life cycles, but once the Queen is installed in the colony, she pretty much just is fed and lays eggs, many of them dozens to thousands or millions, depending on the species the other sexual type of ants is the male."
"Speaker 1","00;38;46;03","00;39;18;16","The male lives to breed. They have a larval development where they're tended to by extensive nurses and then males, usually a little bit leaner and meaner. They try to have sex, they sometimes succeed and then they die. So they only live for an adult phase that's very, very short. So these are the two kinds of sexual ants, the female and the male queen in the male but what we see when we're looking at ants out there in the wild is usually the workers."
"Speaker 1","00;39;18;29","00;39;45;20","So workers start their life by being born as eggs, and they have a different developmental trajectory than the Queen, even though they're both diploid females in most cases, and they can live for months, two years, depending on the species. And there's a process called temporal polytheism by which a worker, once it's born, the first tasks that it performs, are inside of the nest and it performs nursing work."
"Speaker 1","00;39;45;23","00;40;14;17","So it's like as if right after being born, the first thing you did right there in the the neonatal unit was take care of other babies. That's kind of like how the ants work when there are middle aged ants, they tend to be doing nest work like architecture and trash cleanup. And then in their elder worker phase, they do foraging, which is the most dangerous task as well as the most water loss in certain ecologies."
"Speaker 1","00;40;14;27","00;40;46;20","So this is temporal polytheism. So it's not that ants are born into being a nurse or born into being a forager. All the workers progress through a stereotypical sequence of tasks in fact, that progression through stereotypical sequence of tasks by the workers, as well as the fact that workers and queens are both from the same genome. In many cases, a deployed female genome is what has led many to propose use social insects as emerging models for behavioral epigenetic X."
"Speaker 1","00;40;47;05","00;41;11;25","So we know that they display fascinating individual and collective behaviors as well as nature modification stigma g. Ants also display behavioral plasticity. They can learn and they have memory. They can also integrate senses like vision and olfaction and vibration. And again, this is a rising in the context of similar or even identical genetic backgrounds because there are clonal ants."
"Speaker 1","00;41;12;09","00;41;43;18","So here's Washington's epigenetic landscape showing how this developmental bowl, depending on how it bifurcates epigenetically, can lead to different developmental outcomes like this. First bifurcation is are you going to go the fertile route with developed ovaries and a different kind of thorax and wings? Or will you go the sterile route? At which point about 85% of ants have what are called mono morphic workers, whereas the minority of ants have what are called polymorphic workers."
"Speaker 1","00;41;43;18","00;41;52;11","Like, there's two discretely different or more types of workers like majors and minors. So a lot could be said on this, of course. Blue."
"Speaker 2","00;41;52;21","00;42;02;16","Can I just ask a quick question? So I see like flying ants around all the time. I'm not seeing like queens, but are there like species of ants that fly also."
"Speaker 1","00;42;04;16","00;42;20;19","There aren't fly, not workers that aren't flying workers, but during mating flights, you will see flying ants and those are dines and drones flying around looking to mate, especially in the southwest. US where you are."
"Speaker 2","00;42;21;09","00;42;26;01","Got it. OK, so that makes sense that I see flying ants. I'm not crazy. Like they are ants that are flying. OK."
"Speaker 1","00;42;26;19","00;42;58;03","The second people have used many different approaches to study how ants work and how it is the case that you end up getting all these different behaviors out of the same genome. One of the approaches that's been taken is just not looking at any of the molecular details, but purely investigating from a behavioral ecological approach and some of the critical work here has been done by my Ph.D. advisor, Professor Deborah Gordon."
"Speaker 1","00;42;58;20","00;43;21;16","And so she has looked for many years at the relationship between the statistical regularities of the environments and the adaptiveness of different distributed algorithms. So in environments that have as we talked about earlier, like spread out food resources, you wouldn't expect to see pheromone trails forming. Whereas if the food resources are distributed like this, you would expect to see that."
"Speaker 1","00;43;21;25","00;43;46;12","And another example is if it's expensive to forage, then it's going to be the default off mode until it's stimulated. Whereas if it's cheap to forage and maybe even expensive to allow that territory to be taken by a different species, you'd expect to see like an on until disruption mode and these search algorithms are not just idle playthings of mere mixologists."
"Speaker 1","00;43;47;04","00;44;29;12","They've been proposed to be a bridge between organisms, evolution and ecology, bridging the search algorithms that exist on the Internet, on computers, with the kinds of search algorithms that natural systems use. Because wouldn't it be interesting if we could have adaptive search algorithms that make all the trade offs and succeed that species do? And this is an awesome paper by Michelle on kind of like a meta analysis across ants studying the characteristics of their environmental niche and then also their foraging strategies so this is a great work to complement some of Professor Gordon's work."
"Speaker 1","00;44;30;06","00;45;05;19","Behavioral ecology again, is just looking at behavior and ecology together. So we haven't talked about anything molecular but indeed people have studied molecular components of this from 20, 16 and well beyond. We can use evolutionary genomics to investigate some of the genetic underpinnings of ants behavior. Evolutionary genomics gives us the toolkits to compare genomes across species so we can look at species that have behavior A versus B and ask if there are gene families that expand or contract in those species."
"Speaker 1","00;45;06;23","00;45;32;02","So that's about the composition of the genome, like what genes are present or not conserved or on conserved gene families and sequence changes in the genome there's also transcripts, omics. So that's gene expression analysis where we can look at the same tissue or different tissues and how gene expression is differing between the male and females as well as between the reproductive in the sterile females."
"Speaker 1","00;45;33;06","00;46;13;23","We can use Transcript Telmex to investigate the differences between estimates. So a common experimental protocol is, for example, to collect the brain or the antenna from the nurses versus the foragers and then ask about how gene expression changes are associated with differences in behavior. And tissue specificity is really important. You can't just blend up an ant and then say something about how tissues are expressing genes and then also, most recently there's been some of the techniques developed in other species like fruit flies, RNA interference, which is like a way to knock down the expression of a certain gene."
"Speaker 1","00;46;14;08","00;46;38;26","And the first gene expressed gene modifications in ants were published in 2017 with The Mutants Are Here and right now there have only been like knock out, which is easier to do than knock in experiments. But the future of ant genome editing will be quite interesting. So these are using genetic and epigenetic and transcript home ec tools to study ant behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;46;39;18","00;47;17;27","Another approach that relies on neither behavioral ecology or genetics, although of course it's related to them is studying physiology. So in physiology we're interested in similar types of questions. How are species similar and different? How are the reproductive and sterols of females similar and different? How are the different sterile nest mates similar and different? And one of the most common approaches here has been to study the concentration of molecules in the brain like neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, which are common in us as well as well as some neurotransmitters that are trace amines and humans."
"Speaker 1","00;47;18;06","00;47;53;26","But really important for invertebrate neurophysiological function like October 9 a.m. And there's been a relatively epic history of drugging ants in the lab going back to at least the seventies, giving them opioids, hallucinogens, stimulants, THC, all kinds of drugs and more recently, some of the first works where we've been able to provide ants with drugs in the field and this is a phylogenetic perspective by Kami at all looking at which neurotransmitters have been investigated across which and species."
"Speaker 1","00;47;53;26","00;48;07;28","So it's pretty sparse. We don't have a total picture, but that's why we do evolutionary biology, so we can study how the same molecules in species A, B and C play a role. And then maybe we can have a good hypothesis about how it might work for species D."
"Speaker 2","00;48;08;28","00;48;28;28","So clearly I have no background and in ant, you know, species neurotransmission. But I do know quite a bit about neurotransmitters and I'm curious I haven't read the paper, but are the, the use of different neurotransmitters species specific in ants, or do they all pretty much use the same neurotransmitters to do the same things?"
"Speaker 1","00;48;30;21","00;49;01;02","They have the same neurotransmitters, but species by utilize them differently and that would be the whole cool thing to study. Let's talk about the ant brain. So on the right side is a pogo head and this is what the dissected brain looks like. It zoomed in the brain at the same scale as the head is very small. So ants in their head have a lot of muscle for their jaw and a lot of glandular tissue."
"Speaker 1","00;49;01;17","00;49;45;06","And so the brain is taking up a relatively small fraction of the head. Let's see, this video will play OK. I don't think the video's going to play, but Sasha has made some very beautiful immunohistochemical images of three dimensional imprints on the left side, we have just one half of an ant's brain that a picture that Sasha took and it's juxtaposed next to a 2014 paper that developed a new ontology for the brain regions of the invertebrate brain because invertebrate neuroscience was a very discordant field in different species, people would have different names for clearly homologous brain regions."
"Speaker 1","00;49;45;23","00;50;11;09","And so this paper in 2014 brought a lot of clarity to the field because it gave us standard nomenclature for talking about different brain regions. So although the invertebrate brain uses a lot of the same chemicals and families of neuropeptides that are used in the vertebrate brain, it's not organized like the verge of a brain. So there isn't like a brainstem and a limbic system and a prefrontal cortex there are different brain regions."
"Speaker 1","00;50;11;27","00;50;40;02","So just to kind of name a few, here's like the optic nerve coming in to the optic lobe. So the eye is like this sort of curved area that sends signals into the optic lobe. And then similarly the internal nerve comes up from this side and projects into these kind of grape looking clusters into the olfactory lobe. So the layout is very different, but there are some functional and computational analogy use to vertebrate brains."
"Speaker 1","00;50;41;19","00;51;22;29","And then this area up on the top is called the mushroom body. The middle is called the central complex and the mushroom body is known to play a very important role in route memory. For example, the work in Cannock Lettuce, which is another type of desert, aren't so different. Brain regions have identified functions, and what's cool about the invert and the ant brain is we can almost like visualize the whole thing at once because it's small some neural changes have been found to be associated with the bile with the bio behavior of foragers."
"Speaker 1","00;51;22;29","00;51;50;14","So for example, a lot of hormones that have been associated with foraging activity and solitary insects as well as hunger activity in humans have been found to be differentially expressed in foragers. So although they're not foraging for themself, they're foraging for the colony, it turns out there are some extremely deeply conserved neural circuits and peptides related to hunger neuropeptide Y, which is I think called neuropeptide F F, in humans."
"Speaker 1","00;51;51;25","00;52;30;26","There's changes in gene expression which again are found analogously in solitary insects like fruit fly, as well as unsurprisingly in humans. Some of these questions about regulating hunger and about how the perception, the interception of hunger is linked to foraging activity like get up and do something if you're hungry. These are deeply conserved beyond ants, even beyond invertebrates and invertebrates and then, just like so many other behaviors have been found to be, the case changes in the biogenic aiming neurotransmitters in their signaling properties and metabolism have been established in invertebrates."
"Speaker 1","00;52;31;15","00;53;02;20","So these are like tyrosine and dopamine over here, serotonin October mean. And then the enzymes that are kind of like the freeways between the neurotransmitters that transform them into each other, synthesizing and degrading differences in the expression of these enzymes, which we determine with transcript. Comics can influence the levels, so we can use some technologies like HPLC or Gcms to measure the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain."
"Speaker 1","00;53;03;06","00;53;23;11","And then we can do gene expression analysis to look at the receptors and at the metabolic enzymes as well. Why does it all matter? Because a forager doesn't know how much food the colony needs. It doesn't have a dashboard telling it how many seeds there are, how many larva need to be fed, or how much food is out there."
"Speaker 1","00;53;23;29","00;53;48;13","And so it is faced with this go no go decision, stay home or Forage, which is influenced by environmental features that it may not have total awareness of that decision is much like the decision that, for example, an investor might face with looking at even when they have total information or partial information, you have to make some sort of decision."
"Speaker 1","00;53;48;25","00;54;09;02","So foraging would be easy if you knew where the seeds were and you knew exactly when to go and you never made a bad decision. And that's like sort of, you know, buy low, sell high. Like if you knew what the price would do, then trading would be really simple. But the whole question is about decision making. Under uncertainty, not under certainty."
"Speaker 1","00;54;09;15","00;54;18;14","And so that is the question to forage or not to forage. And that distinction will come up again. And again, anything on that blue?"
"Speaker 2","00;54;19;01","00;54;48;21","Yeah. So since you didn't specifically go into foraging, I know we've talked offline about different strategies that ants use for foraging, and it's a common interest that we have. And so ants, their central place foragers for the most part with a nest. But you've given, you know, where they go out some place for it and just in case people don't know is that they leave the nest, they go get food and then they bring it back and share the resources with the people that are living in the nest."
"Speaker 2","00;54;48;21","00;55;04;05","And you told me about ants that use other kinds of strategies like you've told me about the feed as you go ants that don't have a nest. But but are they also central place foragers or do ants ever use other strategies for foraging other than them that."
"Speaker 1","00;55;06;07","00;55;24;08","There are poorly domas ants, so they have multiple nests and they will. So that's not central place because they have multiple places they're bringing it back to. There's ants like army ants that I guess it could be considered a central place, but it's a moving central place."
"Speaker 2","00;55;26;13","00;55;27;02","Nomadic."
"Speaker 1","00;55;27;21","00;56;00;26","Yes, exactly. So lots of kinds of foraging behavior finally, we get to active inference, which is an integrative framework for studying perception and action of different systems. This is what was written in the paper. Active inference is a Bayesian theory of behavior that accounts for perception, learning, decision making and the selection of contextually appropriate actions, all of which are cast as a form of approximate Bayesian or variational inference."
"Speaker 1","00;56;01;27","00;56;33;09","In this framework, perception is modeled as the formation of posterior state estimates. Learning is cast as the process of updating of priors as well as other parameters and decision making and action are processes that compare the evidence for various models about future states and observations under a very possible courses of action. So we're going to continue this thread of having a unified framework for perception and action, and we're going to apply that to the system."
"Speaker 1","00;56;33;27","00;56;40;25","Anything on active inference here every week? What could we say."
"Speaker 2","00;56;41;02","00;56;42;00","A for it?"
"Speaker 1","00;56;42;03","00;57;11;14","So, so much to say about active inference. And the last keyword before we get into the paper more specifically is the behavioral modeling word. So here was from the paper describing how active inference is related to behavioral modeling. Active inference framework naturally lends itself to modeling behavior of different systems across scales generally. What changes across models available in the literature are agent action affordances."
"Speaker 1","00;57;11;18","00;57;38;29","So what can be done by the agent? Visual scanning versus physical movement? The semantics of the prior beliefs. So what are the belief distributions over and the hyper parameterization, the prior distribution of or beliefs like are those fixed or are those learned from the point of view of the dynamics, i.e. the message passing and update equations? All active inference models are the same and so we've seen all kinds of behavioral modeling frameworks."
"Speaker 1","00;57;39;10","00;58;04;28","And while many people have sort of agreed that there's like an input output structure there's some sort of events from the outside world that go to the system of interest to the agent, whether it's a computer program or an animal and behavior outputs, that's kind of where the agreement stops. There's many, many different ways to carry out behavioral modeling and totally discordant simulation approaches."
"Speaker 1","00;58;05;15","00;58;32;03","So one of the aims of bringing active inference to bear here is that we could actually have a framework that not just integrates the perception and action stages, but puts in the ability to specify arbitrary generative models in between that cognitive sandwich and look at the patterns across different systems and different scales, because they would be looking exactly the same from a model outline perspective."
"Speaker 2","00;58;32;28","00;58;59;11","So just to tack on to that, like one of the beautiful things about active inference is it contextualizes the interaction between the agent and the environment. So there is no behavioral modeling like that. Behavior doesn't take place in a vacuum. Right. And so one of the beautiful things about active inference is that it's always, you know, considering like, well, how does this plant grow?"
"Speaker 2","00;58;59;11","00;59;12;19","And it's like, well, that plant grows depending on how much sun there is and how much water there is. And so there's always this perception action loop when considering behavior, which is just, I think probably one of the greatest things about the framework."
"Speaker 1","00;59;14;21","00;59;48;12","Here's the paper that we started on that we ended up modifying to introduce stigma to its a paper, the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles under active inference. So at first glance it's like, wait, it's literally a paper about cultural styles of creating pottery designs. So here's like what the pottery designs look like there's it's kind of black and white art on pottery."
"Speaker 1","00;59;49;02","01;00;23;15","And then the I can see a local set of cells, so like the focal point and the immediate periphery and motifs are visually detected by looking just at pottery. And so different kinds of patterns can be inferred by the visual scanning over pottery patterns. And so in the quest to resolve a culturally informed uncertainty, we have these scanning paths over motifs."
"Speaker 1","01;00;24;00","01;00;46;19","So here it's like the motive was just like this white line. It's like the eyes moved across and I was like, hey, I'm kind of curious, is there is it going to be a motif that looks like a Tetris piece scan up? Nope. OK, and then the scanning happens like that, whereas other motifs have different scanning paths. So that's going to be a lot like the foraging paths that we're going to be looking at."
"Speaker 1","01;00;47;07","01;01;12;26","But there's a few questions that we want to consider, like how is visual scanning similar and different to art foraging? Or in other words, how does epistemic foraging as well as pragmatic foraging differ when you have skin in the game or exoskeleton in the game, you have to move your body visually. You can scan and then go back and then scan and go back and you have it left a mark on your environments."
"Speaker 1","01;01;13;14","01;01;55;15","So it's a foraging task, but it's not stick magic because your vision doesn't modify the object of vision. And so there's these similarities and differences between physical foraging and visual foraging. And then there's the question about how these visual and bodily foraging phenomena are similar or different than conceptual or informational foraging. So foraging is kind of this concept that links all these different pieces from an animal physically moving by the landscape to our sensory modalities like vision, scanning a landscape to informational landscapes."
"Speaker 1","01;01;55;23","01;02;04;01","And there are similarities and differences across these. So we'll look at the sum of the figures and formalisms the code and so on."
"Speaker 1","01;02;06;28","01;02;35;00","Fig. one has a layout of the map and the model, and so the map looks like a T at the bottom of the T is the nest. So this is like the point where the ants emanate out of when they start foraging and then when they return, that's their end point of their foraging trip. And in the classical tmas paradigm, food is placed on one of the arms of the T, the left or the right arm."
"Speaker 1","01;02;35;26","01;02;56;29","In this case we used an alternating tvas paradigm so the food would be on one end of the T for some period of time, and then it would switch to the other side of the T. So this is the, the foraging task that we set up, but this is just a map. You could make it look like a labyrinth or it could look like anything in the simulation."
"Speaker 1","01;02;57;16","01;03;20;16","What happens is the ants start at their nest and then they implement a model which we'll look more at soon. But the ants action affordances are movements. It can move in any of the directions that are surrounding it. So a future model could have ants inertia or it could only move forward to the sides like a pawn or something like that."
"Speaker 1","01;03;20;16","01;03;46;24","And chess can rotate, but we didn't keep track of the ants orientation. We just said the cell is about as big as an ant and they can move to any of the adjacent cells and the ants are able to perceive and act in those local that local environment. And then we use the following two parameter as the model."
"Speaker 1","01;03;46;28","01;04;36;07","So here we go, little bit blurry, but there's a generative model which is just like in any other active inference model, it's a generative model of outcomes and hidden states. Here the outcomes are the perceived pheromone and the hidden states are the true concentrations that are being inferred of the pheromones, the the factors that go into the Markov decision process that's happening inside of each ants are its prior over hidden states the a matrix which maps from the hidden state to the outcome the B matrix which is describing how hidden states change over time and then policy which is suggested here to be influencing the transition between different states and the free energy minimization which"
"Speaker 1","01;04;36;07","01;05;14;11","dictates policy selection. And then we describe the pheromones into ten categories. So there is ten possible concentrations of ceremony in this model. So that's kind of a set up of the model is food is going to be placed and alternating between these two sides of the base. Ants are going to leave the nest and diffuse around with no preference for a direction except when they find a seed, they're going to start depositing pheromones on their return journey and then they have a preference for walking towards regions of increased pheromones."
"Speaker 1","01;05;14;28","01;05;43;01","And it'll be shown that that is actually enough to recapitulate some of the most interesting behavior of ants, like the ability to form a trail to food. And just one interesting piece that differentiates the active inference model from traditional reinforcement or reinforcement driven notions of foraging is in those models, the reward would be the seed at the end or the food itself, and that the cues would be the pheromone trail along the way."
"Speaker 1","01;05;43;13","01;06;21;01","The fair trial would be seen as like a means to an end in the seed would be like the goal. But in active inference, the reward ID. In other words, what the preference is over is actually over pheromones density, and the seed is seen not as a reward, but rather a semiotic cue to switch strategies. So active inference really inverts the situation by making the reward about the moment to moment decision making of the ants and then seize what is traditionally seen as a reward the food itself as actually just a cue to switch behavioral strategies."
"Speaker 1","01;06;21;16","01;06;24;05","So that's one of the most interesting things that we figured out."
"Speaker 2","01;06;25;12","01;06;52;21","So can I just comment in here really quick? Just that that this switching task teams is like it's a very simplified version of the switching bandit problem. So we discuss the multi arm switching banded back, I guess it was maybe 23, I don't know if you recall which livestreaming was 25 maybe, but it was back, I think before the summer, so like maybe 25 or 23."
"Speaker 2","01;06;52;21","01;07;07;13","So that, that livestream talks more about like a stationary bandit problem and a switching bandit problem, but had multi arms like I think eight arms. And here there's a link, there's only two. But I just wanted to draw the parallel between the two kinds of simulations."
"Speaker 1","01;07;08;06","01;07;29;08","It was, I just looked it up, it was 24 with empirical evaluation of active inference in Motor Bandits. This is a two armed bandit, it's the two armed teams, but you can imagine the different switching dynamics or different number of arms. So it absolutely is related to that. Let's go into a little bit more detail on the formalism and the model itself."
"Speaker 1","01;07;30;15","01;08;04;09","So here is describing the process of variational inference and specifically there's a Q Variational distribution that's being fit as a function of the policy and looking at the hidden variables, fair density through from the beginning of time to a given time step and of policy. So those are the kind of the pieces that inference is being done over and then there's a generative model of the outcomes, the hidden states and the policies."
"Speaker 1","01;08;04;09","01;08;37;03","So that's what the agent is doing. Variational inference on and that model doesn't need to be jointly considered all by all, it can be factor ized, which makes it very tractable to compute and then given the factorization, there can be a free energy minimization such that actions are selected based upon the optimization of this variational distribution in a way that it's selecting policies that are expected to minimize the free energy."
"Speaker 1","01;08;37;23","01;09;13;19","So that's in the appendix, and these are some of the formalisms, and it is minimizing the difference between the Q variation or distribution in hidden states at time t given policy, the difference between that variational distribution and this pedestal version, the actual empirical distribution, which is over outcomes, states also condition on policy. So there's again, so much to say about the active inference formalism, but really importantly, the calculations are conditioned on policy."
"Speaker 1","01;09;14;04","01;09;38;15","So it's like we don't need to calculate the exact momentum or trajectory of the car. We need to pick a policy conditional what affordances we have. And so that in a way simplifies and sidesteps a lot of the questions about wanting to describe the world to the highest possible degree of precision because actually what we want precision on is our policy selection."
"Speaker 1","01;09;38;28","01;10;07;01","So that's one key difference is that conditioning on policy and then this ability to do variational inference on a simplified and factories representational distribution cue and then minimize the divergence, the expectation of the divergence between the Q distribution and the empirical P distribution, including outcomes. So those are some of the pieces of active inference that help make it a really scalable and tractable framework."
"Speaker 1","01;10;08;22","01;10;57;02","Here's the figure in the appendix. So we talked about the Markov decision process and what some of these variables mean. But here is like the center point, right? With this is where the ant is located at a given time. And then what it can perceive and its action affordances as well are the adjacent squares. So just like in the visual scanning model, the I could perceive the center point and the adjacent cells here, it's pretty much the same code actually that describes how even though there is a computational object, there's a variable that describes the actual ferryman density across the whole map, just like there was an actual computational variable that described the whole pattern"
"Speaker 1","01;10;57;02","01;11;26;17","of the pottery. We're able to use a remapping matrix that zeros out all of the other cells that aren't the adjacency. So that is what ensures that each Asian is actually doing a purely local decision making. So we kind of take a per agent approach to masking such that it's action and perception. Our constraints are only its local neighborhood."
"Speaker 1","01;11;26;29","01;11;42;02","So that could be changed. You could have ants that are aware of ten cells around them, but only act within one cell. And those are the kinds of extensions to the model that could be done. But we constrained perception of pheromones and action to just adjacencies."
"Speaker 2","01;11;42;26","01;12;00;19","So this is one thing that I wish you guys would have played with because what I would like to see is like, OK, is there something in my immediate proximity? Like I rather like when the likelihood remapping if there's nothing in the immediate proximity, then the ant moves around in accordance with Brownian motion as opposed to moving towards the pheromone."
"Speaker 2","01;12;00;19","01;12;16;21","And like I would like to see just an extra step of code if there's nothing in the nine, let's look in the 25 and move toward the thing with the highest pheromone. Like that's one like because OK it's like a just a more distal like, well like a trace of a scent or something like that."
"Speaker 1","01;12;18;29","01;12;49;24","Yes, it could be done. It could be done by modifying the code. So here's Alex GitHub and just look Alex Shantz and ants probably a coincidence that it's in his name the last few letters, but you really never know these days. And the main pieces of code to look at are and stop by Python that's the main script and stop pi config dot pi has a lot of the parameters."
"Speaker 1","01;12;49;24","01;13;29;11","So if you want to explore having just two ants in the nest or 5 million ants the nest, you can just change a parameter in the config file. And then when the ants stop pi is run, it's going to like look at the config file to run and then figure one, two and three are just for reproducibility to exactly reproduce the figures in the paper let's talk about the pseudo code so we can maybe go over the code during one of the dot, one of the dot two, but this is from the paper to summarize the computational activity of each forager and each time code pseudocode is provided here."
"Speaker 1","01;13;30;01","01;14;10;19","See the code for full details. The active inference model as implemented here does not presuppose or imply any specific neurocognitive architecture for any specific ant species. I believe that was some reviewers comments about what this did or didn't say about what was happening inside of each ant. And again, that's why it's so fun to talk about active inference and these broader philosophical questions while realizing that actually we're just looking at how sensory information comes in and what actions come out and the internal generative model can be a hypothesis that's informed by cognitive architecture, but in fact it isn't that cognitive architecture."
"Speaker 1","01;14;10;19","01;14;45;18","It's kind of like black box modeling, but then we can go into the box and start building sub boxes and hypotheses about what is inside. But we don't need to presuppose any specific cognitive architecture and in this case, the has no memory and no anticipation. So it's like kind of like a one step make a move towards the ferryman it's not predicting or remembering what's happened, but what happens at each time step is it's like, you know, for each at first the ant perceives the local environments that's the ferryman density."
"Speaker 1","01;14;46;10","01;15;39;11","It then updates or optimizes its beliefs about ferryman density with respect to the variational free energy it then after updating its distributional beliefs about ferryman density updates its belief about action. So relatively given the affordances moving in different directions update my beliefs about how different action policies will relate to expected free energy. So it's like let's just say the ferryman above but not as much below that would be perceived in step one and updated in step two and then it'll be like, well, moving up will I can expect to be more like in my preferred state than if I were to move down and then action is sampled based upon the relative proportions of the"
"Speaker 1","01;15;39;11","01;16;05;05","relative free energies of the different action affordances. So that action is sampled from that belief distribution, action selection, and then the agent performs movement and in the case of it, carrying a seed. So having already found the seed, it deposits pheromones, otherwise it doesn't deposit pheromones on the way out there are ants that sometimes deposit pheromones both ways."
"Speaker 1","01;16;05;05","01;16;11;25","But we were studying the sort of simplified case where the ants only puts down pheromones on the way home."
"Speaker 2","01;16;13;14","01;16;34;25","So can I comment really quick on the neurocognitive architecture? So again, like after listening to the internal exam, external exam live stream 5.2, I believe it was, you know, somebody asked that question and Maxwell gave this great answer, which I thought was, was really cool, like, OK, so where in the brain is the generative model in this like internal ism, external some debate."
"Speaker 2","01;16;34;25","01;17;07;02","And that's something that we see like with the visual cortex mapping, et cetera. So where is the generative model? And Maxwell's answer was really cool. Like when you go to machine learning and you don't like look inside the computer for the generative model, like where's the print of the generative model? It's like software it's just running. So I always think that that's a really neat and sorry, sorry, Maxwell, if I like really paraphrase you horribly because I may have, but, but but there's no need for the model to be necessarily inside the brain mapping to some specific brain region."
"Speaker 2","01;17;07;08","01;17;13;19","It can just be software that's just running yes."
"Speaker 1","01;17;15;28","01;17;42;18","Figure two showed an example trace of just a simulation. So the food starts off and has not been discovered yet. So like the density is low and it sort of starts here pure no fair amount. Then it's, it's kind of follows like a zigzag. And you can see like the food was on the right side. And so there was a fair amount trail that was forming down to the nest, starting up on the top, right with the food."
"Speaker 1","01;17;43;15","01;18;09;14","And then the it switches to the left side. And so there starts to be fair amount laid down going towards the left arm. But what's reinforced is still the trunk because that part is like good to have high density on no matter what. And so that was our simulation. This was a colony with 17 estimates over 2000 time steps with three switches of the food location."
"Speaker 1","01;18;10;02","01;18;56;14","And we didn't optimize the parameters or try to like find the best performing sat or it was really just to show that this phenomena of a pheromones trail leading to food that can loosely track location of food changing due to the natural decay of the pheromones so informationally this decay rate can be thought of as environmental perturbation or drift that counteracts the reinforcing effects of state merger convergence or merger tightening we were just like, This is the first pass model that displays that phenomena and it could be optimized to explore how it works differently."
"Speaker 1","01;18;56;14","01;19;15;01","What if one arm is longer or all these different pieces? But this is kind of what the model outputs. And then in the supplement or videos, there's a lot of videos. There's some some large file size gifts of you can see the ants themself diffusing around that. Once there starts to be a trail they start to like really start taking advantage of it."
"Speaker 1","01;19;20;05","01;19;43;11","One of the pieces that was most exciting to think about was how do we measure foraging performance? And this speaks to a common area in studying collective behavior, which is like, how do we think about the relationship between individual level behavior and group behavior? Again, we know that as we talked about earlier, like the individuals are groups and so on."
"Speaker 1","01;19;43;11","01;20;02;00","But just looking at a two level model where we have like agents and then the collective, what are the difference between individual and colony level traits? So colony level phenotypes also, that's why we use nest mate and colony level so that we don't have to use individual or group because nest mate is always just going to be nest mate."
"Speaker 1","01;20;02;00","01;20;25;29","Colony means colony. Colony level phenotypes are summary measurements of emergent properties. In that phenotypes do not apply to separate nest mates, but they're enacted by Nest mates and these are good situations to check out. For example, each nest mate has bodily phenotypes like the width of its head. Every nest mate has a head with or has a mid gut gene expression profile."
"Speaker 1","01;20;27;00","01;20;55;02","But colony phenotypes are those that only exist at the colony level. So there's only one measurement of those per colony, like the total foraging performance or the average interest in internationally distance or the sex ratio of larva. So which sex each larva is is an estimate level, but the larval sex ratio only gets one measurement per colony. And so we looked at two measures of colony foraging."
"Speaker 1","01;20;55;22","01;21;27;10","The number of foraging trips round trip completed through time and a swarm coherence metric. So this is just the amount of foraging trips completed through time, showing how as a function of the number of nest mates in the colony you get different dynamics. So for example, 70 ants finds it faster. The first return trip happens before the 500 time steps finds it faster and ends up getting more, but potentially not multiple times as more."
"Speaker 1","01;21;27;10","01;21;44;23","So there's like some sort of a scaling relationship between the number of Nest mates and the performance and then like look at ten like it finds a few seeds, this blue line, but then it kind of flattens out. So maybe the pheromone trail that the first few brought home just dissipates. So then none of the other ones are really able to latch on to that trail."
"Speaker 1","01;21;45;04","01;22;14;08","So it has a very qualitatively different shape than the other ones. And then this is the swarm distance coefficients, which is like the average distance between the estimates. And so just interesting that got that could change. Maybe if you run it for more timestamps or if you have it in a different structure than the times. But it's almost like the distance increases as the ants spread out and then there's almost like a station parity where the average distance stays relatively similar."
"Speaker 1","01;22;14;22","01;22;36;25","So these are just a few examples of the course you have in the simulation at least you have full information on the location of every nest mate. So if you want to do an individual nest mate level phenotype you can calculate that trivially. But then also there's this question about how do you summarize collective foraging performance? So any thoughts on that?"
"Speaker 2","01;22;38;28","01;22;53;15","So the choice to have full information on the location of every nest meet is an interesting one. And also like I wonder if it's a parameter that you guys tweaked or played with at all. Like what if you just have knowledge of half of the nest mate locations."
"Speaker 1","01;22;56;00","01;23;08;10","Like you could almost simulate being a behavioral ecologist, the grad school simulator where it's like the computer is simulating 100 nest mates, but then you can only see ten of them."
"Speaker 2","01;23;09;19","01;23;18;28","Or each and can only see ten of them. So we have full knowledge of the ants have full knowledge. So that was the question that I have here."
"Speaker 1","01;23;18;28","01;23;45;06","We as simulators have the total traits of the simulation. And one important piece is not included in this was like interactions among Nest mates. They just passed right through each other in this simulation. So that's definitely not too realistic. And in nature, the way that ants know whether they're heading inbound or outbound, they can look at the polarization of the sun, their step integration and the memory."
"Speaker 1","01;23;45;20","01;24;11;15","There's visual scene recognition, and then there's also importantly interactions with other Nest mates on the trail. Like if you're bumping into Nest mates, carrying food, you're probably heading out. And if you're holding food, bumping into empty manifold nest mates, you're probably heading in. And so they can combine all these kinds of sensory information to determine a lot more information than the kind of drift model that we instituted here."
"Speaker 2","01;24;12;07","01;24;32;08","Well, and it just reminded me of this model that we just built with this foraging paper that I'm part of. And in that model, all the foragers know the location of all of the food apriori, right? So they already know where all the food is. So, so but learning where the food is, is really like a whole different model, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;24;32;08","01;24;54;18","Like going to get the food and modeling interactions, like, you know, network formation in foraging patterns is different than learning where the food is, how we learn from others. This collective like learning and that's something maybe that's the difference between intelligence and behavior. Like you can just follow what other people do that's maybe behavioral, but but like learning from others based on different cues and so forth."
"Speaker 2","01;24;54;18","01;24;58;01","I mean, that that's a, that's an maybe an intelligence metric."
"Speaker 1","01;25;03;28","01;25;36;22","Let's return to this broader question about stigma as a type of niche modification and how it plays a role in extended cognition. So this is some nice writing by Axel probably, and referring to some of his work the representation of the environment, leverage to solve the team's problem, i.e., the map is not the one entertained by nest mate brains, but rather the one that is carved out of the environment and leveraged implicitly by each ant as they each forage alone together as a colony."
"Speaker 1","01;25;37;03","01;26;04;11","Leaving cues and estimates can use adaptively. So I like that kind of like collective behavior as being alone together. Like each nest may is perceiving its own unfelt its own local environment is all it perceives. Yet the way that the colony approaches this problem is truly collective as well as truly stick magick. In active inference terms, the ants are endowed with only an extended generative model."
"Speaker 1","01;26;05;00","01;26;30;14","An extended generative model is one where some of the model parameters are encoded not by the agent engaging inference itself, but by the physical environment in which it lives. So that's kind of like a person maybe can have a few numbers in memory. But now imagine if you're hearing a string of numbers and you're writing them down and then you're able to go back and interact, or somebody else could have written the numbers down."
"Speaker 1","01;26;31;00","01;26;56;12","You're going back, and your generative model is functionally including things that are now part of the environment like they're outside of you. So that really speaks to this integrating internal ism and journalism. And it brings up big questions like what other kinds of systems, whether they're currently modeled not in the collective behavior framework or whether they're being modeled as collective behavior, but not a stick magick collective behavior."
"Speaker 1","01;26;56;27","01;27;27;05","What other systems can be modeled? Mystic Magic Act, Active Inference algorithms, and then what kind of individual level and state level behavioral heuristics contribute to adaptive collective behavior in the context of what kind of statistical regularities in the niche or regimes of stigma? Because just it's not like stigma equals adaptive. You could imagine the switching teams where they reinforce it too rapidly and then it is inflexible as the food changes location."
"Speaker 1","01;27;27;22","01;27;44;21","So it's not like, oh, collective behavior equals it's going to be adaptive or stigmatized equals adaptive. There's actually probably only certain combinations of parameters, certain regions of parameter space in which specific environmental regularities can be capitalized upon."
"Speaker 2","01;27;47;19","01;28;11;01","So the idea that the answer only endowed with the extended generative model in the environment and I know like that in the paper they mentioned that memory is something that could be played with. But I'm reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel. So like where Hansel leaves a trail of breadcrumbs behind them. So that they can find their way back home, but or a trail of pebbles the first time that we're not eaten."
"Speaker 2","01;28;11;10","01;28;46;26","So you leave the trail of pebbles. It's like modification of the environment. But like if you can just remember the way, right? Like, like that's, that's an interesting dynamic between knowledge gained from environmental cues versus knowledge that's inherent and retained. And I know maybe you have maybe more to say about ants and ants memory and where maybe these memories or if there's some genetic memory for ants in different species or in maybe even just single colony where like you've talked to me before about colony foraging behavior."
"Speaker 2","01;28;47;06","01;29;00;21","And even in the same species, the foraging behavior is different. And so I'm curious as to your thoughts on you. We don't have to go in right now. Maybe for next week, but your thoughts on on ant memory and how that may come to play."
"Speaker 1","01;29;04;00","01;29;34;26","An interesting question. I think species where the foragers head out alone for longer distances and need to find pieces of prey and bring them back, we'd expect them to have higher memory. Whereas the extreme case of just the pheromones follower, you know, pheromones or specter, and maybe there's a very limited role for memory. And then the question empirically would be are there morphological differences in their brain?"
"Speaker 1","01;29;34;26","01;29;59;13","Is the mushroom body smaller or are there certain genes that have differential expression patterns? How do nurses and forager differ in the expression of those genes? Like maybe nurses don't need to have as much spatial memory, but foragers do need spatial memory or step integration, for example. It's been shown in multiple species that nurses don't have a circadian rhythm."
"Speaker 1","01;29;59;28","01;30;26;21","They are just sort of low key working and chilling 24 hours a day, whereas foragers have a circadian rhythm that's strongly in tuned by the light cycle. So how does memory sort of start? And then how does the temporal polytheism and the trajectory of what the decimate needs to do for the colony, how does that lead to the development of nest mate level cognition?"
"Speaker 1","01;30;27;10","01;30;43;03","And then how have the regularities of the niche selected for colonies that succeed by virtue of being composed of certain kinds of estimates that have certain kinds of memory this returns us to stigma. So what was cool about this."
"Speaker 2","01;30;45;00","01;31;06;05","I just thought it was cool. I mean, I'm always looking for, you know, intelligence and behavior and how these two are linked together. But this paper, which I found like self-publish it on Amazon, but I think it's part of a proceedings anyway. It was just like a neat kind of like Google find. It's a stigma, an intelligence metric for emergent distributed behaviors."
"Speaker 2","01;31;06;28","01;31;32;14","And I'll just read this little piece of it. It says, The complexity of aggregated behavior often depends on stigma G. Stigma G occurs when behaviors by individuals modify the environments while being regulated by the environments. State stigma g has generally been studied for the forward problem. Predicting the consequences of local behaviors. It is also applicable to the backward problem synthesizing local behaviors to fulfill a global need."
"Speaker 2","01;31;32;24","01;31;56;05","The concept provides provides an objective measure of intelligence for natural and synthetic systems. A system's intelligence is measured by its amount of effective stigma. G. It not only adapts to a changing of own environment, but also modifies the environment to suit the system's needs and goals. So I thought that this was just kind of a neat, refreshing perspective on a lot of the things we've been talking about today."
"Speaker 1","01;31;59;18","01;32;24;27","Agree, intelligence is all is often thought of as just being like inside of a brain or in one agent's when we know that that doesn't take the brain body into account, doesn't take the social into account. And then even then, that's where this paper came in was OK. So then even social cognition, let's say you integrate brain and body as well as the social."
"Speaker 1","01;32;25;13","01;32;41;12","You're still just in this floating mob type simulation. How do we talk about the way that interacting agents modify their environment and how that updates their tendencies that's where stigma comes into play, and that's why it was an important thing to do."
"Speaker 2","01;32;42;10","01;33;11;22","And we're increasingly seeing the links drawn between cultural evolution and collective intelligence, because as a species, I mean, we're still obviously not discovering fire and learning how to, you know, make buildings like we already know how to do that. That's why we're not living in these camps anymore. And so we've evolved and, you know, none of our ancestors knew how to use an iPhone, but maybe you know, in nine generations, none of our none of our what do they call it, successors."
"Speaker 2","01;33;12;04","01;33;36;05","That's what it is. None of our successors will also know how to use an iPhone. So it's just us right now. But everything that we do, we're leaving these stigmatic traces behind in our environment that enables us as a species to evolve or become more intelligent for better or for worse anyway. Big questions. So there's some big questions for next week that I'll give you to think about, I hear."
"Speaker 2","01;33;36;26","01;33;59;21","So what is the relationship between collective behavior behavior and collective intelligence? And I'd love to have other people's takes on this. What are other possible measures of group synergy or colony synergy? How our colony level metrics retained in ants over time? In this model, forgetfulness is critical. So do you think that the ability to forget is as important as memory in human or behavior?"
"Speaker 2","01;34;00;18","01;34;12;01","Is Sigma G a measure of intelligence or behavior or both? Maybe. And then does trust play a role in you? Social Insect synergy? And I have some more, but I thought that that was a good start."
"Speaker 1","01;34;13;20","01;34;46;20","All great questions. I would yeah. I think I got some dot one questions. I got some two questions, got some dart three questions. But this is an open line of research. The paper was published only this year in 20, 21. So if this is something where you think, oh, I have a theoretical contribution or I study archeology and I want to learn how stigma G might relate to those kinds of models, or, Oh, I'm way better coding than this, and I could make da da da da da improvement on the code."
"Speaker 1","01;34;47;10","01;35;11;08","Let's do it. So these will be fun things to discuss. Lou, thanks for all the help on the zero in this fun conversation. We hope to see many of you on the DART one and two in the coming weeks on the 21st and on the 28th and Tucker in the chat wrote Would love to hear and learn more about memory and collective systems."
"Speaker 1","01;35;11;28","01;35;30;01","Totally agree. And when we think of like the von Neumann computer architectures like where's memory it's like I mean there's two spots where it can be, right? It can be in the hard drive, long term storage or it can be in RAM short term storage. And then that has even percolated into how we think about short and long term memory in organisms."
"Speaker 1","01;35;30;20","01;35;54;08","But now what about the niche modification? What does it look like and how do we think about it? Is it simply that like data A is in short term and data B is moved to the environment or is something modified about the environment and something modified about the internal generative model such that the information can be recapitulated only through interaction with the environments?"
"Speaker 1","01;35;55;18","01;36;28;03","How would we think about memory in that case? And that's also why ant colony optimization and swarm computation are part of the broader umbrella of unconventional computing architectures, because they do challenge or move beyond some of the sort of classical notions of memory processing bandwidth, clock speed. We didn't have to talk about that, but those are things that studying natural systems makes us wonder about."
"Speaker 1","01;36;30;20","01;36;31;03","Sometimes."
"Speaker 2","01;36;31;03","01;36;33;06","Blue Sea soon."
"Speaker 1","01;36;33;26","01;36;35;19","See you later. See everyone next week by."
