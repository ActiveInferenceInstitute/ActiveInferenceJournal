00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everybody welcome to the active

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
inference lab this is live stream number

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,799
29.0 on

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
september 14th is it september 14th not

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,119
anymore

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,640
september 17

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
17.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
at least where we're at

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
on september 17 2021

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
welcome to the active inference lab

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
we are a participatory online lab that

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
is communicating learning and practicing

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
applied active inference you can find us

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
at the links here on this slide

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
this is recorded in an archived live

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,520
stream so please provide us with

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
feedback so that we can improve our work

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
welcome and we'll be following good

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,520
video etiquette for live streams

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
at the short link on this slide you can

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
see the past present and future live

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,280
streams

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
and just to call your attention to the

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
tabs on the bottom

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
the first tab are our regular tuesday

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,520
live streams so for these ones we do the

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
zero contextualizing video that's what

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
you're watching now and then we have a

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
dot one and a dot two where on two

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
successive weeks we try to have the

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
authors try to have a lot of different

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,240
people on a panel just talking about the

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
paper

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
the guest stream is sort of a wild card

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
slash anything goes we have a lot of

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
different topics

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
model streams reflect machine learning

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
different kinds of modeling and

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
walkthroughs of code and the math stream

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
is for talking about math and different

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
formal frameworks so if you are

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
interested in co-organizing or

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
presenting for any of these different

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
kinds of streams then just get in touch

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
with us

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,240
today in active stream 29

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
we're going to be having the goal of

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,280
learning and discussing this paper

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
active inference and active inference

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,159
framework for ant colony behavior

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
by freedman chance ramstead fristen and

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,159
constant

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
and just like

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
all of the other.0 videos this is just

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
an introduction to some of the ideas

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
it's not a review

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
or a final word

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
and it doesn't change too much even when

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,599
the first or any author is on the stream

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,400
we're gonna go over the keywords

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
as well as the aims and claims the

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
abstract all the usual things that we

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
cover in the dot zeros and in the coming

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
weeks we're gonna be discussing this

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,280
paper so everybody is welcome to join

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
from whatever

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
area they're excited about the paper

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,040
from

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
just get in touch with us

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,519
so we can begin with a little

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
introductions and

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
warm-ups

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
um

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
blue how about you can go first and then

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
we'll pass it to the first author

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,360
so i'm blue knight an independent

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
research consultant from new mexico and

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
i'll pass to daniel friedman the first

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
author of this paper

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
thanks blue so i'm daniel i'm a

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
postdoc researcher in california and

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
yeah usually we have everybody except

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,920
for the first author introduce

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
themselves and then the first author

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
uh steps in and gives a little

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,120
background on the paper so it's fun it's

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
the first time that we've discussed one

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
of my papers on the stream

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
and uh we'll be talking about a bunch of

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
different aspects of it and it's awesome

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,959
to have you here blue with a lot of

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
expertise in collective behavior and a

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
bunch of other areas

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,239
the big question that motivated not just

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
this live stream but this whole line of

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
research in this paper

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
is

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
assuming that each agent is a quote from

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
the paper assuming that each agent

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
nestmate has only limited access to

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
incoming information

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
how can a group of active inference

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
agents solve complex group foraging

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,360
problems

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
so in the case of ants that local

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,439
information is going to be the pheromone

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
density the chemicals that it can

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
perceive its local umvelt but in the

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
case of information foraging it's what

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
we see or it's our perspective or the

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
people who we can communicate to and so

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,080
this is a topic that's come up in many

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
different guises which is

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,720
again when you have a multi-agent system

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
using active inference to model each

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
agents how do we think about the way

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
that the

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
perceptions and cognition and action of

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
each individual active inference agents

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,320
how do those compose or interact so that

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
the group can have adaptive or

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
interesting behavior the big question of

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
the paper and also again just a big open

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
question hardly one that gets

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
answered in its finished form by the

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
paper or by this discussion

129
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
anything you want to add

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
only that um i was really excited to i

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,479
actually i picked this paper and i've

132
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,479
been kind of pressuring daniel to do it

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,280
for a little while maybe three months or

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,759
so since i first read it so um i picked

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
this paper because

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
complex behavior complex group foraging

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
problems it's really linked to my

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
interest in collective intelligence and

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
in scaling intelligence which is also

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
why i'm drawn to active inference so i'm

141
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,919
just curious to see your insight into

142
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,560
ants and the deeper like you know when

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
we see a paper we see only the surface

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
the final product and so it's really

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
going to be fun to take a deep dive into

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
the little nuanced things that kind of

147
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,320
maybe led you to the the birth of this

148
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,639
paper

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
great

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
visual with sort of what's on the

151
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,919
surface and what's beneath the surface

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
and in fact foraging is such a fun task

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
to study not to get ahead of ourselves

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
but it's one of the few tasks of the ant

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
colony that you can see outside you just

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
stand next to the nest entrance just

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
like this picture which is taken

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
while i was doing field work in arizona

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,360
so there where all the ants are coming

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,919
in and out of this is the nest entrance

161
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,280
and so this

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
species the red harvester ant

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
pogonomyrmex barbados

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
it's like there are ants coming in and

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,000
out doing some trash work mid-work but

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
mostly what you see on the outside is

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,880
foraging

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
and so what happens underneath well

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
here's this painted ant with the three

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
yellow dots so we can take a little

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,280
tracer

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
down underneath and we can see what is

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
happening beneath the surface of the

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
foraging

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
the paper is active in france an active

176
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,479
inference framework for ant colony

177
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,960
behavior and we read the authors

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
previously it was a really awesome

179
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
collaboration so thanks a lot to to alec

180
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,240
maxwell carl and axel who each brought

181
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
really important insights here

182
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,840
and

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,039
two of the main aims and claims and then

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,280
blue you can provide any thoughts

185
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
in this paper we develop and implement a

186
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,000
bayesian simulation model derived from

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
the active inference framework that

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
captures some of the underlying dynamics

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
and emergent phenomena of ant colony

190
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,840
foraging behavior

191
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
that's what we did and the second point

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
is

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,520
by integrating the bayesian ant colony

194
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,639
perspective

195
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,880
of hunt and others

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,720
with stigmatic regulation and the

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
scale-free formalism of active inference

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,840
fields in glazebrook 2020

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
we provide an integrative framework for

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
behavioral ecological and evolutionary

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
modeling in ants

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
such an integrated approach could

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
facilitate the transfer of modeling

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
insights from ant colonies to human

205
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
design systems

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,479
and i guess back

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
so cool aims and claims they weren't

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
very forthcoming with or or you guys

209
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,080
weren't very forthcoming with the aims

210
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
and claims of the paper but i found like

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
lots of them like nested like little

212
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
gems in the paper so this is just a

213
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
couple of them but i think that this

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
paper was very um you know

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,960
on the bleeding edge we say instead of

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
like the leading edge cutting into some

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
some novel areas and making some new

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
connections that we haven't seen before

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
or at least i haven't seen before

220
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,879
cool there's what we did which is

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,199
write a simulation based upon

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,520
theoretical grounding and then there's

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
the fields that were integrated which

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
was a sort of bayesian forager

225
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,800
multi-agent perspective

226
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,599
stigma g which we'll talk about soon

227
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
and of course active inference

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
and that is going to

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,799
hopefully develop field of ant research

230
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
and

231
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
other areas that stand to learn from

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,760
either the bayesian multi-agent

233
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
perspective stigmargy or active

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
inference so that is quite a large swath

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
do you want to read the first part of

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
the abstract

237
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
sure

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
in this paper we introduce an active

239
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
inference model of ant colony foraging

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
behavior and implement the model in a

241
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,240
series of in-silico experiments active

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
inference is a multi-scale approach to

243
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,080
behavioral modeling that is being plot

244
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
applied across settings in theoretical

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
biology and ethology the ant colony is a

246
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
classic case system in the function of

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,640
distributed systems in terms of

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
stigmatic decision making and

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
information sharing

250
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
the second half of the abstract is

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
here we specify and simulate a markov

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,399
decision process model for ant colony

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,720
foraging we investigate a well-known

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
paradigm from laboratory and colony

255
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
behavioral experiments the alternating

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
t-maze paradigm to illustrate the

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
ability of the model to recover basic

258
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
colony phenomena such as trail formation

259
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
after food location discovery

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
we conclude by outlining how the active

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
inference ant colony foraging behavioral

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
model can be extended and situated

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
within a nested multi-scale framework

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,279
and systems approaches to biology more

265
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,680
generally

266
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
how from that abstract do we forage

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
ahead that's why we have a roadmap

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
first in the introduction section

269
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
we talk about bayesian multiscale

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
modeling and stigmargy

271
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
and then introduce the need and basis of

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
an active inference model of the ant

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
colony

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,560
in the methods section we talk about the

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
foraging task specifically which is the

276
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,760
alternating teammates but that's really

277
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
just a map it's kind of like

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
minecraft or simcity like you can

279
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
specify any kind of map you want we used

280
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
an alternating t-maze for a few reasons

281
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,279
and then we talk about the active

282
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
inference model for ant colony foraging

283
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,200
specifically

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,440
we present some results

285
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
and we didn't have any

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,399
live ant recordings in this paper so the

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
results are more like schematic

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,360
they suggest what kinds of things can be

289
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
measured and be discussed

290
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
for multi-agent active inference systems

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
specifically the colonies foraging

292
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
performance and swarm coherence metrics

293
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,320
and then in the discussion we talk about

294
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
three scales of analysis and implication

295
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
for the work

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,839
which is at the nest mate the colony and

297
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,480
the population scale

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,399
and we use those words intentionally

299
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,839
because they're all

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,560
ants someone says oh there's an ants on

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
my windowsill and they mean a little

302
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
six-legged nest mate but

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,200
if the colony is the organism then

304
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
wouldn't the ant be the colony and just

305
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
it's a piece of ant tissue on your

306
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,399
windowsill

307
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
and then we end with a concluding remark

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
so it's a relatively sparse

309
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
road map but maybe we don't need that

310
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,000
many signposts to get where we're going

311
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
any road map comments

312
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
no good let's forage ahead

313
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
exactly exactly

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
um

315
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
the key words were

316
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,519
ants

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
forging just

318
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,000
why even continue ants foraging active

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,839
environment oh yes that's right

320
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,079
behavioral modeling collective behavior

321
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,959
evo eco diva or ecoevo devo different

322
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
people order it differently and

323
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,440
stigmergy so these are going to be

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
keywords that

325
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
open many doors

326
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,279
so let's go into them

327
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
we'll start with sort of the grand

328
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,720
gaia level keyword which is eco evo devo

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
that's just how i say it but we might

330
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
have done evo eco devo in the paper

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,720
eco evo devo stands for

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
ecology evolution and development

333
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,800
so this is one way to see it with these

334
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,440
three interacting domains so it's like a

335
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,959
tri-disciplinary or transdisciplinary

336
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,920
approach

337
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
that is going to just like the name

338
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
would have you believe just like action

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
and inference come together in active

340
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,720
inference

341
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
evodivo is going to integrate across

342
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
these three fields so what's happening

343
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
as organisms develop

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
in their ecosystem and how evolution

345
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
shapes that

346
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
but it's also

347
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
and this is drawn from the gilbert at

348
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,399
all paper and a good text to read on it

349
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
is the abohif at all 2014 paper

350
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
it's actually a historical lineage

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
so those who study the history of

352
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,480
evolutionary theory might be familiar

353
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
for example with the modern synthesis of

354
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
evolutionary biology

355
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
which happened in the first half of the

356
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,120
1900s and integrated for example

357
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,440
population genetics and quantitative

358
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
genetics with evolution well

359
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
here's a cool timeline from the gilbert

360
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,519
paper

361
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
talking about how from the 1800s with

362
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,880
darwin as well as

363
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
antecedents

364
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
moved through sequence of really

365
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,160
important developments after the first

366
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,360
half of the 1900s so these are

367
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,480
post-1950s post

368
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
the discovery or elucidation of the

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
structure of the dna molecule

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,440
things like symbiosis

371
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,920
the way that microbial interactions

372
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
shape development

373
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
um a lot of cool things and on the

374
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
bottom here growing awareness of

375
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
beneficial symbioses

376
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
so eco evo devo is referring to a

377
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,079
historical lineage that is becoming

378
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
increasingly recognized as an important

379
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
integrative take on

380
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
the systems that we're a part of what

381
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,040
would you have to say about ecoevo blue

382
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,000
just that it's constantly um

383
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
i mean we're becoming so much more aware

384
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
of

385
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
the the different facets that go into

386
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
eco evo devo and um how interconnected

387
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,639
and fundamentally important

388
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,680
they are

389
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
in a triad

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,760
um it's like for me uh the clear like i

391
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
remember being at the neuroscience

392
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,680
meeting and i don't remember the name of

393
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
the professor but she was a toxicologist

394
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,839
from johns hopkins and had been working

395
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
in her field for i don't know like 30

396
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
years and this is like when they're

397
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
doing the microbiome sequencing which

398
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,040
was maybe like 20

399
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
12 20 13 somewhere around there and so

400
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,040
they're doing like the massive

401
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,199
microbiome sequencing and she got up and

402
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
said um you know we're gonna have to

403
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,560
redo all of the toxicology work that uh

404
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
i've done my entire life which it just

405
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,560
was so um overwhelming and um

406
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,279
i i it just really blew my mind to hear

407
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,800
such a renowned professor stand up and

408
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
say you know we don't know what's toxic

409
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,680
and what's not because we've not

410
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,240
considered the whole and so in in

411
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
relation to toxicity and ecology and

412
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
evolution and development like we

413
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
consider developing like you know of

414
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,600
course we consider children eating lead

415
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,160
paint and so forth and i think we're you

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,320
know we've looked at evolution but but

417
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
really that this the ecology of our own

418
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
survival is something i think that

419
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
people are just starting to to become

420
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,199
more aware of and attuned to

421
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
and there's a famous quote in biology by

422
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
debzanski nothing in

423
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
life makes sense except in the light of

424
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
evolution it's like but doesn't nothing

425
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
makes sense except in the light of

426
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
development and ecology and physics and

427
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
so on so it's kind of like

428
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
right we should have integrative

429
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,920
frameworks

430
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
whatever their english titles are so

431
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
that we can understand all the light

432
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
that's being cast on the phenomena that

433
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
we care about

434
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
and i'm reminded of the holobiont too

435
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
that chris fields brought up right all

436
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
of that

437
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,839
yes

438
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,880
what are

439
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
some of the ways that we can think about

440
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
the phenomena we care about well one of

441
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
the big key words here is collective

442
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
behavior that's one of the key words of

443
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
the paper so here's a lewis thomas quote

444
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
it is in our collective behavior that we

445
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,320
are most mysterious

446
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,639
individuals are collective too

447
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,560
we were never individuals

448
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,920
and

449
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,279
here's a nice map from wikipedia

450
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,160
of

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,880
complex systems some of the key terms a

452
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,079
little fractal with complex systems and

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,320
complexity itself and then like a

454
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
palette with the art

455
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
we have the different key terms like

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
systems theory and evolution and then

457
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
here's collective behavior up here so

458
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
collective behavior is one of the

459
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,199
fundamental pillars of complexity

460
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,439
because collective behavior is just

461
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,799
studying

462
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
systems interacting

463
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,359
what do you think about that blue

464
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,039
uh i want to say it in the next slide

465
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
sounds good

466
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,520
what is the difference between

467
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,799
collective behavior and collective

468
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,080
intelligence

469
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
right and so this is something that um

470
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
you know we've talked about offline but

471
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
really like when you look at collective

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
behavior and collective intelligence and

473
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
this was just a map i also pulled from

474
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,679
wikipedia's definition of collective

475
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
intelligence and so here i mean this is

476
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,080
clearly you know framed in a human

477
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
situation or is it

478
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
do ants have open source software maybe

479
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
we can talk about that

480
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,559
um but but collective intelligence you

481
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
know it's these three branches framed in

482
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
this image it's coordination

483
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
and cooperation which both of those come

484
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
into

485
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,880
the collective behavior

486
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
like play when i think about

487
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
fish schooling or or like you know birds

488
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
flocking right this is like a behavior

489
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,400
right good that we behave and coordinate

490
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
to to behave collectively uh for for

491
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
each other's mutual benefit and for the

492
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
benefit of the flock or the school or

493
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,799
whatever

494
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,400
but the only thing that's left out in

495
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,919
this triad is cognition and so

496
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
like what is cognition is that input

497
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
output or is is cognition intelligence

498
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,080
or what's the difference between

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
cognition and intelligence so for me

500
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
there's a like a very blurry

501
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
uh boundary between what is collective

502
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
behavior and what is collective

503
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,720
intelligence um and so i mean we've also

504
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
talked offline and so i just want to

505
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
know you know my thoughts on this are

506
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
evolving

507
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
and i'm curious as to maybe people that

508
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
are listening to this or maybe anybody

509
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
that wants to come onto our next live

510
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
stream and talk about it like if they

511
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
have strong opinions on collective

512
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,600
behavior versus collective intelligence

513
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
but i'd like to hear if you have any you

514
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,000
know

515
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
overwhelming thoughts

516
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,720
it's um

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
definitely two different perspectives on

518
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
intelligence and behavior there's sort

519
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
of like

520
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
some who would say that intelligent

521
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,039
behavior it's defined by its outcome

522
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,480
and it doesn't matter what's happening

523
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
internally and then there's sort of the

524
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
possibility that intelligence could

525
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
exist in the absence of behavior

526
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
now frameworks like we discussed in live

527
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
stream 28 with mental action

528
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
with mental

529
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
and cognitive processes as themselves

530
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
being action

531
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
and being modeled as action in active

532
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
inference framework that sort of blurs

533
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
the distinction but definitely that's

534
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
gonna be a question like

535
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,320
is collective behavior the same thing as

536
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
collective intelligence is intelligence

537
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
simply behavior

538
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
and then something i always wondered

539
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
about with collective behavior oh well

540
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
you know collective behavior groups of

541
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,840
people

542
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
okay but aren't people groups of cells

543
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
so

544
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
if collective doesn't mean anything as

545
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
opposed to individual then we're just

546
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
talking about

547
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
phenomena or behavior so you know let's

548
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
drop the adjectives that don't really

549
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,600
matter so what are we signaling when

550
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
we're talking about collective behavior

551
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
as opposed to saying yeah i'm talking

552
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
about individual groups you know

553
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,640
individual crowds of humans for example

554
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
i definitely think that um

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
you know there's

556
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
definitely if

557
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,280
if you could have no

558
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
you could have intelligence without

559
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
behavior of course because babies can't

560
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
do anything but like lay there in bed

561
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
and like observe you know like they just

562
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
you know can suck their fingers or

563
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
something but but there's some

564
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
intelligence there that doesn't have

565
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
necessarily an associated action

566
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
and a tremendous amount of intelligence

567
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
because they're learning and you know

568
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,039
building their own model of the world um

569
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
and so what is collective and i was

570
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
listening to the um internalism

571
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
externalism live stream like number 5.2

572
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
for anybody who wants to go back in time

573
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
and revisit that with me i was listening

574
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
to that last night and and it's like you

575
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
know what is the preferred level of

576
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
analysis right right like from the noble

577
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
paper like where do we get this you know

578
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,000
preferential level diagnostic uh and you

579
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
know we are as individuals collectives

580
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
collect collections of human and other

581
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
types of cells so so what is this

582
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
collective behavior versus collective

583
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
intelligence i don't know it's it's

584
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,159
something that's always mushy to me

585
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
there's a kantian perspective on that

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
for another time

587
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
one way that we can talk about a

588
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
specific type of collective behavior is

589
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
by introducing this topic of stigma g so

590
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,200
sometimes when people talk about

591
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
collective behavior in the first slide

592
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
of their talk they'll say you know

593
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,679
flocks of birds and here's a group of

594
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,159
people walking through a landscape and

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
those are examples of coordination

596
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,559
amongst agents but stigma g is actually

597
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,400
pointing out a really specific and

598
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,480
important different type of collective

599
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
behavior so here's from the wikipedia

600
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
describing that stigma g was introduced

601
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,120
by a termite biologist pierre paul

602
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
grasse

603
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,360
in the 1950s so it's a recent

604
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
term but of course people have seen this

605
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
phenomena before

606
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
and he defined it as

607
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
stimulation of workers by the

608
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
performance they have achieved no not

609
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
performance uh based benefits for jobs

610
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,360
but more

611
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,960
deriving from the words mark stigma and

612
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
aragon or work like an error the unit of

613
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,880
work

614
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
it captures the notion that an agent's

615
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
actions leave signs in the environment

616
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
and signs that it and other agents can

617
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
sense which determine and incite their

618
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
subsequent actions so here we're not

619
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
just looking at sort of interactions

620
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
amongst subunits of the birds looking at

621
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
each other or the school of fish but

622
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
actually the modification of the

623
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,120
environment through the actions of the

624
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
agents and then the ways that the

625
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
environmental conditions modify how the

626
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
agents behave

627
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,400
so

628
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
here is like the agents in feedback with

629
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
the environment

630
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
and what grassley was looking at was how

631
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
termites how one termite would pick up a

632
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,320
little clod of dirt and then put it

633
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,000
somewhere probabilistically and then

634
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
that would change the likelihood that it

635
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,919
picks up or puts down certain other

636
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,159
pieces of dirt later and so you could

637
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,559
imagine like one termite building a nest

638
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,760
by itself

639
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
or many happening at the same time

640
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
maybe even moving pieces of dirt in the

641
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
same way so stigmargy is actually a

642
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
mechanism by which extended cognition

643
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
occurs

644
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
and by which cognitive processes can be

645
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
scaled not just by increasing the

646
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
bandwidth or the type of interactions

647
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
laterally amongst agents

648
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
but actually by externalizing

649
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,960
the work

650
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,760
to

651
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
marks on the environment

652
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
and in the paper it was written here we

653
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
present the first active inference type

654
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,720
model of stigma g and the first active

655
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
inference model focusing on insect

656
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,760
behavior

657
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
so think about that there's been a lot

658
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,080
of navigation work in active inference

659
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
but when the mouse is moving through the

660
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
team maze for example or when the eyes

661
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,559
are scanning over the piece of text

662
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,159
which are active inference models that

663
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,279
we've seen

664
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,360
they don't leave traces

665
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,279
even when there's multi-agent active

666
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
inference simulations the interactions

667
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
have been lateral and the environment

668
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,679
has been taken as fixed so that's why we

669
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,720
brought

670
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
ecoevo in

671
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
because now we're thinking about the way

672
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,520
that agents are in feedback with their

673
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,679
environments and each other and how

674
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,760
stigma juice as a topic reflects that

675
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
this is pretty cool you added this

676
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
second slide on stigma g so what does it

677
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,159
show

678
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,799
i did so this is another um

679
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,840
just a image that i pulled off of um

680
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
wikipedia and it's taken from this is

681
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,400
someone's phd thesis stigmatic

682
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
collaboration a theoretical framework

683
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
for mass collaboration

684
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,080
and again it shows here coordination

685
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,720
cooperation and collaboration as opposed

686
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
to cognition

687
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
in this collective

688
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,039
activity or collective behavior model

689
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
and one of the things that i just really

690
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,840
thought um

691
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,440
was cool to point out

692
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
was on the right side under

693
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,679
collaboration okay

694
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,600
so collaboration is distinguished by

695
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
co-created emergent shared

696
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
representation

697
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
which manifests as creativity i thought

698
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,840
that was super interesting because

699
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
creativity applies

700
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,039
implies novelty in some way to me right

701
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,000
it implies like either a new use or or

702
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
or you know developing something that's

703
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
entirely new making new connections

704
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,960
um as well as co-created emergent shared

705
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
representations result in divergent

706
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,480
production

707
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
and evaluation

708
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
so how does this co-create an emergent

709
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,640
shared representation result in

710
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
divergence i thought that this was just

711
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
it was an interesting figure and all

712
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
these different like components and end

713
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
results are are just an interesting way

714
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
to think about sigmoidy and like can we

715
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,679
go through our environment without a

716
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,279
trace like we've all seen like murder

717
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,760
mysteries or like i mean how hard is it

718
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
actually to not leave a trace in in the

719
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
environment behind you even if it's

720
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,840
hairs or or fingerprints or whatever it

721
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,720
might be

722
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
so so none of us is without this leaving

723
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
a mark on the environment and what how

724
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
does stigmergy contribute to human niche

725
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,080
construction which were incredibly adept

726
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,960
at and and how do we learn from that the

727
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,240
traces that are left by others

728
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,640
we certainly stigmatically generated

729
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,600
this

730
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
presentation because i also drew from

731
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
the 2006 work of mark elliott

732
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
and um

733
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
elliott wrote

734
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,240
many questions arise when confronted

735
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
with the streamlined efficacy and

736
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
apparent lack of organization and

737
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
motivation of these new global

738
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,919
enterprises like wikipedia and others

739
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,240
that were being mentioned in 2006.

740
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
not the least of which how does this

741
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
work

742
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,400
stigmatic collaboration provides a

743
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
hypothesis as to how the collaborative

744
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,559
process can jump from being untenable

745
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
with numbers above 25

746
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
towards becoming a new driver in global

747
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
society with numbers well over 25 000.

748
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,440
pre-blockchain

749
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,039
free bitcoin

750
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
pre whatever it is that we're going

751
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
through now but these four tenants from

752
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,799
2006 really say a lot which just like

753
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
blue's image reflected

754
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
collaboration depends on communication

755
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,440
and communication happens in networks so

756
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,679
that's kind of collective behavior 101

757
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,279
that's something that you'd see in the

758
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,919
flock of birds or the school of fish

759
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,760
collaboration is inherently composed of

760
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,559
two components without without either of

761
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,399
which collaboration cannot take place

762
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,799
social negotiation and creative output

763
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,399
if there aren't lateral social

764
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,000
interactions there isn't uh an

765
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
interacting group and without the

766
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
creative output then the productivity is

767
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,159
low so maybe systems like that can be

768
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,760
designed but probably not that

769
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,559
interesting or important

770
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,480
this is for humans collaboration small

771
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
groups 2 to 25 rely upon social

772
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,960
negotiation to evolve and guide its

773
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,120
process in creative output so that's

774
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,000
like the startup model or the small team

775
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,880
model

776
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,159
however

777
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
elliott's proposal

778
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
is that collaboration in large groups 25

779
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,440
to

780
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,039
however many

781
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
is dependent upon stigma g

782
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,440
you need to have if you have 25 or more

783
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
people in a meeting and it's an hour

784
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
meeting it's like everybody can be

785
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
taking notes on a shared document

786
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,799
everybody can be editing the wiki

787
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,880
everybody can be typing in the chat

788
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
but if people are talking linearly each

789
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,960
person's going to only be able to speak

790
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
for two minutes on average so just think

791
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
about how that scales up if you had a

792
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,399
thousand people working on a project

793
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,520
each person is only going to be able to

794
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
speak for a few seconds per hour so what

795
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,399
are the mechanisms by which instead of

796
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
just lateral ephemeral interactions

797
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
amongst agents

798
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
how can we modify

799
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
a single source of truth

800
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,080
in no sense

801
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
so that productivity can actually occur

802
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,480
and it's important to note that it's not

803
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,880
that social negotiation doesn't take

804
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,120
place when we're doing stigmargy in big

805
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,399
groups so it's not like wikipedia

806
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,080
editors aren't aware of each other as

807
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,679
social entities

808
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,520
it's just that as elliott wrote

809
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,679
negotiation takes a back seat in terms

810
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
of the creative drafting process most if

811
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
not all stigmatic wiki collaborations

812
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,320
have discussions associated with the

813
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,679
content being developed but it's

814
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,159
possible to contribute to wikipedia.org

815
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
for instance without discussing what

816
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,880
you're contributing to or creating so

817
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,640
that's kind of a cool insight

818
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,679
anything else to add on stigma yeah just

819
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
the group size is super interesting

820
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
because we are um

821
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
like i'm writing a paper on central

822
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
place foraging right now actually like a

823
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,279
unrelated paper but um it's interesting

824
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
this large groups of humans because like

825
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,559
we're looking at hunter-gatherer

826
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,320
societies and the formation of camps and

827
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,559
like what did human society kind of look

828
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,200
like way back um and and really the

829
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
estimate uh that's you know pretty

830
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,399
agreed upon in the field is you know 500

831
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,640
people in a camp which it like you know

832
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
it's like 100 families of five is like

833
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
the upper limit and like you know mostly

834
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,960
like at least um maybe 250 people for a

835
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,799
camp to

836
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
maintain right for it to stay cohesive

837
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,120
for it to stay bound together and i

838
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
think it's interesting because what what

839
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
was the stigmargic

840
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
process back in like the hunter-gatherer

841
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
foraging days like what did that look

842
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,799
like it's just interesting to to wonder

843
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,399
about and think about if it's dependent

844
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
on sigmergy i mean like now i think

845
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
about we stack rocks right like if you

846
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
you're marking a trail like everybody's

847
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
been out hiking and you see these

848
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,919
rock stacks it's like what are those

849
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,960
like when you first start seeing them

850
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,399
and then you see that they're trail

851
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
markers and you know i don't have to

852
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,080
know like no one told me that rocks are

853
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,000
stacked there to mark the trail but it's

854
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,399
like this is a clearly human signature

855
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,320
nobody else stacks rocks up that's weird

856
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,799
right and so you see these stigmatic

857
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
like things that are just left as traces

858
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
in the environment that could be used to

859
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,440
guide like large large groups of humans

860
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
across time even

861
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,840
yes and even in the definition of stigma

862
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,200
tree we saw marks and signs so semiotics

863
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
and biosemiotics comes into play

864
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,039
let's get

865
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
to the ants and potatoes

866
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,600
the eusocial insects

867
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
you social is a cool word we're not

868
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,679
going to go too much into the difference

869
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,919
of uh what is eusocial versus other

870
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,440
social forms

871
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,799
but some of the

872
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,320
exemplar eu social insects are ants

873
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
all of the around 15 000 ant species in

874
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
the world are eusocial

875
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,679
so they all live in colonies

876
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
there's no solitary ants and they live

877
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,760
in colonies where there's

878
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
you could call it a reproductive

879
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,279
division of labor

880
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
also honeybees are eusocial with a queen

881
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
and worker distinction

882
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
and termites are as well um most bees

883
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
are not eusocial so honeybees are a bit

884
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
of an outlier in that respect and just

885
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
like there are eusocial wasps not all

886
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
wasps are usocial

887
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
and there's sort of six images here

888
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
because i want to show that there's some

889
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
related species like ants and bees and

890
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,519
wasps are hymenoptera that's an order of

891
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,159
insects but termites are in a totally

892
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,480
different order more closely related to

893
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
cockroaches

894
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,720
and you social insects are able to

895
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
accomplish tremendous feats of stigmargy

896
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
and niche modification

897
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,200
here's a leafcutter ant colony being

898
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
excavated by tiny little humans big

899
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,159
colony here's

900
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,799
a bee hive with honey and the cells and

901
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,640
the amazing geometry that they can

902
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
construct or that they can work with

903
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
once constructed by humans

904
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,200
and also very large nests for termites

905
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,919
so you social insects are really cool

906
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
how do they do what they do

907
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,720
well

908
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,919
i wanted to pull from a few slides from

909
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,720
my phd work which was on ants so these

910
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,240
are just some fun slides about ants and

911
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,080
um

912
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,399
if you want to ever jump in blue then go

913
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,120
for it but this was from some early work

914
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,880
um that was

915
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
at in the middle school

916
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,880
age range talking to people about ants

917
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,200
so one of the first things about ants is

918
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,880
there's no leader

919
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
on the left side we see the um

920
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
without getting into sex and gender

921
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,679
politics there are female

922
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,399
reproductives called queens usually

923
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,399
again a whole another topic why and

924
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,279
should they be called queens there are

925
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,320
males

926
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
who are sometimes called drones they

927
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
don't play

928
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,679
as active a role in the day-to-day tasks

929
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,679
of the colony and then there are sterile

930
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,880
females which we call worker nest mates

931
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
and the image on the right shows the

932
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,039
queen laying eggs

933
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,519
which are being nursed and tended to by

934
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,799
the nurse task group of workers

935
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,799
so she can just the queen can just pump

936
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,559
out eggs and the nurses are taking care

937
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,600
of it

938
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,480
and they're also feeding the queen and

939
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,640
then you have foragers outside of the

940
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,519
nest

941
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,919
making decisions for themselves so

942
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,360
there's no bluetooth there's no

943
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,080
long-range communication there's no hive

944
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,159
mind need we just have independent

945
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,919
agents making decisions for themselves

946
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,320
locally and there's no leader ant

947
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,320
how do they do that how does it work

948
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,839
without a leader

949
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,639
the way it works is that individual ants

950
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,480
make probabilistic decisions about

951
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
behavior based upon

952
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,399
the rate and type of interactions they

953
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,520
receive

954
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
so here we can start with just this ant

955
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
on the top left and it's walking along

956
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
and it starts encountering a high rate

957
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,918
of trash and so it thinks or acts as if

958
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,040
it thinks

959
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
i should start picking up trash maybe

960
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,000
the next one i see i'm more likely to

961
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
pick up

962
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
encounters a piece of trash can identify

963
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,119
that by the scent

964
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,239
picks it up

965
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,679
and can continue walking until it

966
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,599
encounters another scent maybe the

967
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
midden pile where there's a bunch of

968
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,879
trash piled up

969
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,280
walks along for some more time

970
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
before it doesn't encounter any more

971
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,640
trash and then reverts to a more

972
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
generally poised state

973
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
so this can be modified with a drift

974
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
diffusion model or response threshold

975
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,920
model

976
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,599
there's a lot of mathematical models of

977
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,599
how different rate and type of

978
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,200
interactions

979
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
probabilistically can update behavioral

980
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
tendencies but this is just a general

981
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,079
way that we can look at how different

982
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,560
ant behaviors play out we can always ask

983
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
what is the individual interacting with

984
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
and how are they responding to that

985
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,359
interaction

986
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
well how do you go from just responding

987
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,880
to interactions to adaptive behavior

988
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
the nature and what the adaptive

989
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
behavior looks like is going to depend

990
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
on the ecology

991
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,640
again eco evo devo

992
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,880
so here we see two possible ecologies of

993
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
food on the left is a colony where food

994
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
is found sparsely but in very clumpy

995
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,680
piles this is like a picnic in the

996
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,400
argentine ants in this case it makes

997
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,119
sense that there would be a trail

998
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,520
that might get laid down that helps

999
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,400
direct nest mates to the location where

1000
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
another nest mate previously found the

1001
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,680
food

1002
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,240
however there's also ants that are

1003
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
looking for food sources that might be

1004
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
mobile like looking for live prey or

1005
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
maybe just scattered dead prey but like

1006
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
just dead insects in the desert bringing

1007
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,839
them back and in those cases you're not

1008
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,680
any more likely to find food where

1009
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,839
another nest may found it and so in that

1010
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,720
situation you see a lot more independent

1011
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
foraging activity and you don't see a

1012
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,119
pheromone trail so just because we're

1013
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,960
talking about pheromones there's a lot

1014
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
of different kinds of pheromones there's

1015
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,880
nest marking and queen pheromones and

1016
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,119
larval pheromones it's not just trail

1017
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
for pheromones and they're not just

1018
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,960
making these kinds of nests

1019
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,440
though there are ecologies that favor

1020
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,920
these types of collective algorithms

1021
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
and then

1022
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
across ecologies

1023
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
there's this lose it to find it

1024
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,640
component which is the balance

1025
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,400
you know in the sense between explore

1026
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,480
and exploit or between pragmatic and

1027
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,200
epistemic values and goals which we talk

1028
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
about in active inference

1029
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,760
because

1030
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
if

1031
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,320
every single ant were to follow the

1032
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,839
pheromone trail

1033
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
then they could exploit locally but they

1034
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
would have a challenge discovering new

1035
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,200
food resources whereas if none of the

1036
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,079
ants followed the pheromone trail

1037
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,640
then it wouldn't be informative and so

1038
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,800
it'd be a totally different game as well

1039
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
so there's this balance between

1040
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,079
following

1041
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,160
the traces that i've been made before

1042
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,760
and going off and discovering new

1043
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
resources so that applies to seed

1044
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,119
foraging and also information foraging

1045
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,480
which is kind of

1046
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,359
a

1047
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,359
parallel that we'll be looking at again

1048
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,440
and again so those four

1049
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,520
uh pithy little statements there's no

1050
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,359
leader it's about the response to

1051
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,800
interactions and the way it looks

1052
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,960
depends on the inter on ecology the

1053
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
interactions with the ecology and that

1054
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
across tasks there's this lose it to

1055
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,520
find it balance between explore exploit

1056
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,400
those

1057
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,560
capture a lot of the dynamics of ants

1058
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
the life cycle of an individual queen is

1059
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,000
that she is also born as an egg and

1060
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
develops into usually a winged

1061
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,440
fertile form that's called a gyne like a

1062
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,200
princess

1063
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
she will mate with males and found a

1064
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
colony but there's other lifestyles for

1065
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
example that don't require mating with

1066
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,320
males or

1067
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
in which case the queen doesn't found a

1068
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
colony by herself but rather breaks off

1069
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,160
with some workers there's a lot of

1070
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,640
diversity in the ant life cycles but

1071
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
once the queen is installed in the

1072
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,599
colony she pretty much just is fed and

1073
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,560
lays eggs many of them dozens to

1074
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
thousands or millions depending on the

1075
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,560
species

1076
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
the other sexual

1077
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,960
type of ants is the male the male lives

1078
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
to breed they have a larval development

1079
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
where they're tended to by extinct

1080
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,320
nurses

1081
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
and then males usually a little bit

1082
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,440
leaner and meaner

1083
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
they try to have sex they sometimes

1084
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
succeed and then they die so they only

1085
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
live for um

1086
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,200
an adult phase that's very very short so

1087
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,359
these are the two kinds of sexual ants

1088
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,760
the female and the male queen and the

1089
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,000
male

1090
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,040
but what we see when we're looking at

1091
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,760
ants out there in the wild is usually

1092
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
the workers

1093
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,359
so workers start their life by being

1094
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,920
born as eggs and they have a different

1095
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,839
developmental trajectory than the queen

1096
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
even though they're both diploid females

1097
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,440
in most cases

1098
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,599
and they can live for months to years

1099
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,839
depending on the species

1100
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
and there's a process called temporal

1101
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,880
polyethylism by which a worker once it's

1102
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,920
born

1103
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
the first tasks that it performs are

1104
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,160
inside of the nest

1105
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,079
and it performs nursing work so it's

1106
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
like as if right after being born the

1107
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
first thing you did right there in the

1108
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,560
um the neonatal unit was take care of

1109
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
other babies that's kind of like how the

1110
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,079
ants work when they're middle aged ants

1111
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,079
they tend to be doing nest work like

1112
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,480
architecture and trash cleanup

1113
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
and then

1114
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
in their uh elder worker phase they do

1115
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,040
foraging which is the most dangerous

1116
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,160
task as well as the most um

1117
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,119
water loss in certain ecologies so this

1118
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,880
is temporal polyethylene so it's not

1119
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
that ants are born into being a nurse or

1120
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,720
born into being a forager all the

1121
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
workers progress through a stereotypical

1122
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,319
sequence of tasks

1123
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,599
in fact that progression through a

1124
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,520
stereotypical sequence of tasks by the

1125
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,560
workers as well as the fact that workers

1126
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,440
and queens are both from the same genome

1127
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,160
in many cases a diploid female genome

1128
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,119
is what

1129
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,280
has led many to propose you social

1130
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
insects as emerging models for

1131
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
behavioral epigenetics

1132
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,119
so we know that they

1133
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,359
display fascinating individual and

1134
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,119
collective behaviors as well as niche

1135
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,119
modification and stigmargy

1136
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,359
ants also display behavioral plasticity

1137
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,440
they can learn and they have memory they

1138
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,079
can also integrate senses like vision

1139
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,400
and olfaction and vibration

1140
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,560
and again this is a rising in the

1141
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,520
context of similar or even identical

1142
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,960
genetic backgrounds because there are

1143
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,760
clonal ants so here's waddington's

1144
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,520
epigenetic landscape

1145
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,079
showing how this developmental ball

1146
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,000
depending on how it bifurcates

1147
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,920
epigenetically can lead to different

1148
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,599
developmental outcomes like this first

1149
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,920
bifurcation is are you gonna go the

1150
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,720
fertile route with developed ovaries and

1151
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,280
a different kind of thorax and wings or

1152
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,440
will you go the sterile route at which

1153
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,920
point about 85 percent of ants have what

1154
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,000
are called monomorphic workers

1155
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,319
whereas the minority of ants have what

1156
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,760
are called polymorphic workers like

1157
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
there's two discretely different or more

1158
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
types of workers like majors and minors

1159
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,599
so

1160
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,079
a lot could be said on this of course

1161
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,640
blue can i just ask a quick question

1162
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,520
so

1163
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,240
i see like flying ants around all the

1164
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
time i'm not seeing like queens but are

1165
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,079
there like species of ants that fly also

1166
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,960
um there aren't flying workers there

1167
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,520
aren't flying workers um but during

1168
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,280
mating flights

1169
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
you will see flying ants and those are

1170
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,040
guys and drones flying around

1171
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
looking to mate especially in the

1172
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,359
southwest us where you are

1173
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,800
got it okay so that makes sense that i

1174
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
see flying ants i'm not crazy like they

1175
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
are ants that are flying okay

1176
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,000
just checking

1177
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,599
um

1178
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,040
people have used many different

1179
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,240
approaches

1180
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
to study

1181
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,560
how ants work and how it is the case

1182
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
that you end up getting all these

1183
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
different behaviors out of the same

1184
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,400
genome

1185
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,319
one of the approaches that's been taken

1186
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,319
is just not looking at any of the

1187
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,480
molecular details but purely

1188
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
investigating from a behavioral

1189
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,720
ecological approach and

1190
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,280
some of the critical work here has been

1191
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,760
done by my phd advisor professor deborah

1192
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,640
gordon

1193
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,200
and so she has looked for many years at

1194
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,280
the relationship between the statistical

1195
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,680
regularities of the environment

1196
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,440
and the adaptiveness of different

1197
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
distributed algorithms so in

1198
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,200
environments that have

1199
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,280
as we talked about earlier like spread

1200
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,040
out food resources you wouldn't expect

1201
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,079
to see

1202
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,319
pheromone trails forming whereas if the

1203
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,319
food resources are distributed like this

1204
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
you would expect to see that and another

1205
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,520
example is if it's expensive to forage

1206
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
then it's going to be in a default off

1207
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,160
mode until it's stimulated whereas if

1208
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,400
it's cheap to forage and maybe even

1209
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,480
expensive to allow that territory to be

1210
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,319
taken by different species you'd expect

1211
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,560
to see like an on until disruption mode

1212
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,000
and these search algorithms are not just

1213
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,040
idle play things of miramicologists

1214
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,760
they've been proposed to be a bridge

1215
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,400
between organisms evolution and ecology

1216
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,079
bridging the search algorithms that

1217
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,040
exist on the internet on computers with

1218
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,359
the kinds of search algorithms that

1219
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,160
natural systems use because wouldn't it

1220
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,480
be interesting if we could have adaptive

1221
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,160
search algorithms

1222
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,520
that

1223
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,319
make all the trade-offs and succeed that

1224
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,520
species do

1225
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,359
and this is an awesome paper by michelle

1226
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,440
lenon

1227
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,319
um kind of like a meta-analysis

1228
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,680
across

1229
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
ants studying the characteristics of

1230
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
their environmental niche and then also

1231
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,319
their foraging strategy so this is a

1232
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,400
great work to complement some of

1233
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,160
professor gordon's work

1234
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,680
behavioral ecology again is just looking

1235
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,839
at behavior and ecology together so we

1236
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,760
haven't talked about anything molecular

1237
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,560
but

1238
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,720
indeed people have studied molecular

1239
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,880
components of this

1240
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,319
from

1241
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,960
2016 and well beyond

1242
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,760
we can use evolutionary genomics

1243
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,319
to investigate some of the genetic

1244
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,200
underpinnings of ant behavior

1245
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,119
evolutionary genomics gives us the

1246
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,599
toolkits to compare genomes across

1247
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
species so we can look at species that

1248
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,760
have behavior a versus b

1249
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,599
and ask if there are gene families that

1250
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,640
expand or contract in those species

1251
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,400
so that's about the composition of the

1252
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
genome like what genes are present

1253
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,200
or not conserved or unconserved gene

1254
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,960
families and sequence changes in the

1255
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,920
genome

1256
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,520
there's also

1257
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,760
transcriptomics so that's gene

1258
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
expression analysis

1259
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,520
where we can look at the same tissue or

1260
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,119
different tissues

1261
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,520
and how gene expression is differing

1262
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,599
between the male and females

1263
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,040
as well as between the reproductive and

1264
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,119
the sterile females

1265
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,640
we can use transcriptomics to

1266
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
investigate the differences between

1267
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
estimates so a common experimental

1268
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,040
protocol is for example to collect the

1269
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,560
brain or

1270
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,640
the antenna from the nurses versus the

1271
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,040
foragers and then ask about how gene

1272
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,640
expression changes are associated with

1273
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
differences in behavior

1274
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,800
and tissue specificity is really

1275
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,280
important you can't just blend up an ant

1276
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
and then say something about how tissues

1277
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,880
are expressing

1278
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,119
genes

1279
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,640
and then also

1280
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,760
most recently there's been some of the

1281
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,680
techniques developed in other species

1282
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,520
like fruit flies

1283
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
rna interference which is like a way to

1284
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
knock down the expression of a certain

1285
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,599
gene and the first

1286
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,440
gene express gene

1287
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,520
modifications and ants were published in

1288
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,119
2017 with the mutants are here

1289
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,280
and right now they've only been like

1290
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,440
knock out which is easier to do than

1291
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,680
knock in experiments but

1292
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,760
the future of ant

1293
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,079
genome editing will be quite interesting

1294
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,920
so these are using genetic and

1295
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
epigenetic and transcriptomic tools to

1296
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
study and behavior

1297
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,680
another approach that relies on neither

1298
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,480
behavioral ecology or genetics although

1299
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
of course it's related to them is

1300
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,000
studying physiology

1301
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,640
so in physiology we're interested in

1302
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,480
similar types of questions how are

1303
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
species similar and different how are

1304
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,560
the reproductive and steriles uh of

1305
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,720
females similar and different how are

1306
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
the different sterile nest mates similar

1307
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,160
and different

1308
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
and

1309
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
one of the most common approaches here

1310
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,000
has been to study the concentration

1311
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,599
of molecules in the brain like

1312
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,800
neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin

1313
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
which are common in us as well as well

1314
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,720
as some neurotransmitters that are trace

1315
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280
amines and humans but really important

1316
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,800
for invertebrate

1317
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,160
neurophysiological function like

1318
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
octopamine and tyramine

1319
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,680
and there's been

1320
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,640
a relatively epic history of drugging

1321
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,160
ants in the lab

1322
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,400
going back to at least the 70s

1323
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,480
giving them opioids hallucinogens

1324
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,559
stimulants thc

1325
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,680
all kinds of drugs and more recently

1326
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,400
some of the first works where we've been

1327
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
able to provide ants with drugs in the

1328
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,839
field

1329
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,760
and this is a phylogenetic perspective

1330
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,520
by cami at all

1331
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
looking at which neurotransmitters have

1332
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,280
been investigated across which ant

1333
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
species so it's pretty sparse so we

1334
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
don't have a total

1335
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,920
picture but that's why we do

1336
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,640
evolutionary biology so we can study how

1337
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,680
the same molecules in species a b and c

1338
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,359
play a role and then maybe we can have a

1339
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,119
good hypothesis about how it might work

1340
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,960
for species d

1341
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,839
so clearly i have no background in in

1342
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,880
ant you know species neurotransmission

1343
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,319
but i do know quite a bit about

1344
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,839
neurotransmitters and i'm curious i

1345
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,040
haven't read the paper but um are the

1346
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,200
the use of different neurotransmitters

1347
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,839
species specific in ants or do they all

1348
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,040
pretty much use the same

1349
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,720
neurotransmitters to do the same things

1350
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,599
they have the same

1351
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:34,640
neurotransmitters but species might

1352
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
utilize them differently

1353
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,880
and that would be the whole cool thing

1354
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,559
to study

1355
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,680
let's

1356
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,000
talk about the ant brain

1357
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,520
so on the right side

1358
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,359
is a pogo head and this is what the

1359
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,359
dissected brain looks like it's zoomed

1360
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,160
in

1361
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
the brain at the same scale as the head

1362
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
is very small

1363
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,599
so ants in their head have a lot of

1364
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,920
muscle for their jaw and a lot of

1365
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,480
glandular tissue and so the brain is

1366
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,400
taking up a relatively small fraction of

1367
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,440
the head let's see this video will play

1368
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,200
um okay i don't think the video is going

1369
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,040
to play but

1370
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,160
sasha

1371
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,599
has made some very beautiful

1372
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,800
immunohistochemical images

1373
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,640
of three-dimensional amp brains

1374
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,960
on the left side we have just one half

1375
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,319
of an aunt's brain

1376
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,640
that a picture that sasha took

1377
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,880
and it's juxtaposed next to a 2014 paper

1378
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,680
that

1379
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,559
developed a new ontology for the brain

1380
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,640
regions of the invertebrate brain

1381
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,559
because invertebrate neuroscience was a

1382
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,640
very discordant field in different

1383
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,319
species people would have different

1384
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,640
names for clearly homologous brain

1385
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,760
regions

1386
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,240
and so this paper in 2014 brought a lot

1387
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,119
of clarity to the field because it gave

1388
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,880
us standard nomenclature for talking

1389
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,640
about different brain regions so

1390
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,640
although the invertebrate brain uses a

1391
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,599
lot of the same chemicals and families

1392
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,440
of neuropeptides that are used in the

1393
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,559
vertebrate brain it's not organized like

1394
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,319
the vertebrate brain so there isn't like

1395
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,160
a brain stem in a limbic system and a

1396
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,480
prefrontal cortex there are different

1397
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,280
brain regions so just to kind of name a

1398
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,400
few

1399
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,720
here's like the optic nerve coming into

1400
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,319
the optic lobe

1401
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,200
so the eye is like this sort of curved

1402
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,760
area that sends signals into the optic

1403
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,599
lobe and then similarly the antennal

1404
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
nerve comes up from this side

1405
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,000
and projects into these kind of grape

1406
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,680
looking clusters into the olfactory lobe

1407
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,160
so the layout is very different but

1408
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
there are some functional and

1409
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,680
computational analogies to vertebrate

1410
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,680
brains

1411
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,040
and then

1412
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,119
this area up on the top is called the

1413
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,559
mushroom body the middle is called the

1414
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,680
central complex and the mushroom body is

1415
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,880
known to play a very important role in

1416
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,720
route memory

1417
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,520
for example the work in cataclysm which

1418
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,760
is another type of desert ant

1419
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
so different brain regions have

1420
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,520
identified functions

1421
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,599
and what's cool about the invert and the

1422
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,319
ant brain is we can almost like

1423
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,319
visualize the whole thing at once

1424
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,200
because it's small

1425
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,400
some neural changes have been found to

1426
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,319
be associated with the

1427
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,079
bio

1428
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:20,880
uh

1429
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,359
with the biobehavior of foragers so for

1430
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,559
example

1431
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,160
a lot of hormones that have been

1432
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
associated with foraging activity and

1433
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
solitary insects as well as hunger

1434
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
activity in humans

1435
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,680
have been found to be differentially

1436
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,240
expressed in foragers so although

1437
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,760
they're not foraging for themselves

1438
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
they're foraging for the colony

1439
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,599
it turns out there are some extremely

1440
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,559
deeply conserved neural circuits and

1441
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,880
peptides related to hunger neuropeptide

1442
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,920
y

1443
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,920
which is i think called neuropeptide ff

1444
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,839
in humans

1445
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,440
there's changes in gene expression which

1446
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,240
again are found analogously in solitary

1447
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,119
insects like fruit fly as well as

1448
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,359
unsurprisingly in humans some of these

1449
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,240
questions about regulating hunger and

1450
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,319
about how the perception the

1451
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,480
enteroception of hunger

1452
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,280
is linked to foraging activity like

1453
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,520
get up and do something if you're hungry

1454
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,079
these are deeply conserved beyond ants

1455
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
even beyond invertebrates and in

1456
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,440
invertebrates

1457
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,559
and then

1458
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,720
just like so many other behaviors have

1459
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,640
been found to be the case changes in the

1460
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,040
biogenic amine neurotransmitters in

1461
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,160
their signaling properties and

1462
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
metabolism have been established in

1463
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,520
invertebrates

1464
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,160
so these are like tyrosine and dopamine

1465
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,720
over here serotonin octopamine and then

1466
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,119
the enzymes that are kind of like the

1467
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,359
freeways between the neurotransmitters

1468
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,079
that transform them into each other

1469
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,400
synthesizing and degrading

1470
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,720
differences in the expression of these

1471
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,440
enzymes which we determine with

1472
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,000
transcriptomics

1473
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,960
can

1474
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,440
influence the levels so we can use some

1475
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,400
technologies like hplc or gcms to

1476
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,079
measure the amount of neurotransmitters

1477
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,119
in the brain

1478
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,800
and then we can do gene expression

1479
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,520
analysis to look at the receptors and at

1480
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,720
the metabolic enzymes as well

1481
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,200
why does it all matter

1482
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
because a forager doesn't know how much

1483
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,839
food the colony needs it doesn't have a

1484
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,520
dashboard telling it how many seeds

1485
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,599
there are or how many larva need to be

1486
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,920
fed or how much food is out there

1487
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,640
and so it is faced with this go no go

1488
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,280
decision stay home or forage which is

1489
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,760
influenced by environmental features

1490
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,520
that it may not have total awareness of

1491
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,200
that decision

1492
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,680
is much like the decision that for

1493
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,480
example an investor might face with

1494
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,480
looking at even when they have total

1495
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,960
information or partial information

1496
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,880
you have to make some sort of decision

1497
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,680
so

1498
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,359
foraging would be easy if you knew where

1499
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,760
the seeds were and you knew exactly when

1500
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,680
to go and you never made a bad decision

1501
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,599
and that's like sort of you know

1502
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,079
buy low sell high like if you knew what

1503
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,599
the price would do

1504
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,640
then

1505
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,720
trading would be really simple but the

1506
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
whole question is about decision making

1507
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,440
under uncertainty not under certainty

1508
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,720
and so that

1509
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,960
is the question to forage or not to

1510
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,920
forage

1511
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,480
and that distinction will come up again

1512
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,520
and again

1513
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,119
anything on that blue

1514
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,440
yeah so since you didn't specifically go

1515
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,240
into foraging um i i know we've talked

1516
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,280
offline about um different strategies

1517
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,559
that ants use for foraging and um it's

1518
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,960
the common interest that that we have

1519
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,599
and so ants are central place foragers

1520
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,240
for the most part with a nest but you've

1521
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,720
given um you know where they they go out

1522
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,240
central place foraging just in case

1523
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,520
people don't know is that they leave the

1524
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,720
nest they go get food and then they

1525
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,040
bring it back and share the resources

1526
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,400
with the people that are living in the

1527
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,359
nest and you told me about ants that use

1528
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,280
other kinds of strategies i like you've

1529
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,599
told me about the feed as you go

1530
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,839
ants that don't have a nest but but is

1531
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,520
are they also central place foragers or

1532
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,240
do ants ever use other strategies for

1533
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,839
foraging other than than

1534
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,079
that there are polydomis

1535
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,040
ants so they have multiple nests and

1536
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,880
they will so that's not center place

1537
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,799
because they have multiple places

1538
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,640
they're bringing it back to

1539
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,079
there's ants like army ants that um i

1540
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,000
guess it could be considered a central

1541
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,040
place but it's a moving central place

1542
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,400
um

1543
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,760
nomadic

1544
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,720
yes exactly so lots of kinds of foraging

1545
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,720
behavior

1546
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,599
finally we get to active inference which

1547
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,559
is

1548
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,640
an integrated framework for studying

1549
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,640
perception and action of different

1550
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,720
systems

1551
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,520
this is what was written in the paper

1552
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,200
active inference is a bayesian theory of

1553
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,119
behavior that accounts for perception

1554
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,960
learning decision making and the

1555
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,880
selection of contextually appropriate

1556
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,400
actions

1557
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
all of which are cast as a form of

1558
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,839
approximate bayesian or variational

1559
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,200
inference in this framework perception

1560
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,680
is modeled as the formation of posterior

1561
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,599
state estimates

1562
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,599
learning is cast as the process of

1563
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,440
updating of priors

1564
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,280
as well as other parameters

1565
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,680
and decision making and action are

1566
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
processes that compare the evidence for

1567
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,760
various models about future states and

1568
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,400
observations under possible courses of

1569
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,520
action

1570
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,359
so we're going to

1571
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,960
continue this thread

1572
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,119
of having a unified framework for

1573
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,880
perception and action

1574
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
and we're going to apply that to the ant

1575
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,839
system

1576
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,200
anything on active inference here

1577
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,799
every every week what could we say

1578
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,280
voyage ahead four days so so much to say

1579
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,040
about active inference

1580
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,040
um and the last

1581
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,720
key word before we get into the paper

1582
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,319
more specifically

1583
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,880
is uh the behavioral modeling

1584
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,160
word

1585
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,200
so here was from the paper describing

1586
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,640
how active inference is related to

1587
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,720
behavioral modeling

1588
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,559
active inference framework naturally

1589
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,240
lends itself to modeling behavior of

1590
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,400
different systems across scales

1591
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,240
generally what changes across models

1592
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
available in the literature are agent

1593
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,559
action affordances so what what can be

1594
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,720
done by the agent visual scanning versus

1595
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,240
physical movement

1596
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
the semantics of the prior beliefs so

1597
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,000
what are the belief distributions over

1598
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,240
and the hyper parameterization the prior

1599
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,319
distribution over beliefs like are those

1600
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,640
fixed or are those learned

1601
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,559
from the point of view of the dynamics

1602
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,319
i.e the message passing and update

1603
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,319
equations all active inference models

1604
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,599
are the same

1605
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,200
and so we've seen all kinds of

1606
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,839
behavioral modeling frameworks and while

1607
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,160
many people have sort of agreed that

1608
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,880
there's like an input output structure

1609
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,400
there's some sort of events from the

1610
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,760
outside world

1611
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,119
that

1612
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,040
go to the system of interest to the

1613
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
agent whether it's a computer program or

1614
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
animal and behavior outputs that's kind

1615
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,319
of where the agreement stops

1616
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,400
there's many many different ways to

1617
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,319
carry out behavioral modeling and

1618
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,440
totally discordant simulation approaches

1619
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,040
so one of the aims

1620
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,720
of bringing active inference to bear

1621
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,760
here

1622
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,359
is that we could actually have a

1623
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,680
framework that not just integrates the

1624
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,559
perception and action stages

1625
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,000
but puts in

1626
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,160
the ability to specify arbitrary

1627
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,920
generative models in between that

1628
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,240
cognitive sandwich and

1629
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,839
look at the patterns across different

1630
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,839
systems and different scales because

1631
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,079
they would be looking exactly the same

1632
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,880
from a model outline perspective

1633
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,160
so

1634
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,160
just to tack onto that like one of the

1635
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,799
beautiful things about active inference

1636
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,000
is it contextualizes the interaction

1637
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,440
between the agent and the environment so

1638
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,760
there is no

1639
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,240
behavioral modeling like that behavior

1640
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,400
doesn't take place in a vacuum right and

1641
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,000
and so one of the beautiful things about

1642
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,880
active inference is that it's always um

1643
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,480
you know considering like well how does

1644
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,079
this plant grow and it's like well that

1645
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,000
plant grows depending on how much sun

1646
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,599
there is and how much water there is and

1647
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,559
so there's always this perception action

1648
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,200
loop when considering behavior which is

1649
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,359
just um i think probably one of the

1650
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,558
greatest things about the framework

1651
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,000
here's

1652
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,280
the um

1653
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,400
paper

1654
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,280
that we started on

1655
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,520
that we ended up modifying to introduce

1656
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,960
stigma g2

1657
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,640
it's a paper the acquisition of

1658
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
culturally patterned attention styles

1659
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,400
under active inference

1660
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,640
so at first glance it's like wait it's

1661
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,760
it's literally a paper about cultural

1662
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,119
styles of creating pottery designs

1663
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,119
so here's like what the pottery designs

1664
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,520
look like

1665
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,880
there's

1666
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,520
um it's kind of black and white art

1667
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,119
on pottery

1668
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,000
and then

1669
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,640
the eye can see a local

1670
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,319
set of cells

1671
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,760
so like the focal point and the

1672
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,359
immediate periphery

1673
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,640
and motifs are visually detected

1674
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,319
by looking just at

1675
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,520
pottery

1676
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,680
and so different kinds of patterns can

1677
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,960
be inferred

1678
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,799
by the visual scanning

1679
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,119
over pottery patterns

1680
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,960
and so

1681
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,359
in the quest to resolve a culturally

1682
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,839
informed uncertainty

1683
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,319
we have these scanning paths

1684
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,000
over motifs

1685
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,599
so here it's like the motif was just

1686
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,839
like this white

1687
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,520
line it's like the eyes moved across and

1688
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,720
it's like hey i'm kind of curious is

1689
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,400
there is it going to be a motif that

1690
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,880
looks like a tetris piece scan up nope

1691
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,000
okay

1692
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
and then the scanning happens like that

1693
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,799
whereas other motifs have different

1694
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,839
scanning paths so that's going to be

1695
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,839
a lot like the foraging paths that we're

1696
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,200
going to be looking at

1697
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,640
but there's a few questions that we want

1698
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,920
to consider like how is visual scanning

1699
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,000
similar and different to ant foraging

1700
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,359
in other words

1701
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,000
how does epistemic foraging as well as

1702
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
pragmatic foraging differ

1703
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,599
when you have skin in the game or

1704
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,319
exoskeleton in the game you have to move

1705
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,400
your body visually you can scan and then

1706
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
go back and then scan and go back and

1707
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,240
you haven't left a mark on your

1708
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,440
environment

1709
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,680
so it's a foraging task

1710
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,920
but it's not stigmatic because your

1711
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,040
vision doesn't modify the object of

1712
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,400
vision

1713
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,319
and so there's the similarities and

1714
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,400
differences between physical foraging

1715
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,040
and visual foraging and then

1716
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,319
there's the question about how these

1717
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,880
visual and bodily foraging

1718
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,760
um

1719
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,119
phenomena

1720
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,280
are similar or different than conceptual

1721
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,440
or informational foraging

1722
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,240
so foraging is kind of this concept that

1723
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,160
links all these different

1724
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,440
pieces from

1725
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,040
an animal physically moving on a

1726
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,240
landscape

1727
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,680
to our sensory modalities like vision

1728
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,799
scanning a landscape to informational

1729
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,799
landscapes and there's similarities and

1730
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,680
differences across these

1731
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,520
so we'll look at the some of the figures

1732
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,839
and formalisms the code and so on

1733
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,079
figure one

1734
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,599
has a layout of the map and the model

1735
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,720
and so the map looks like a t

1736
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,119
at the bottom of the t is the nest so

1737
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,000
this is like the point where the ants

1738
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,319
emanate out of when they start foraging

1739
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,240
and then when they return

1740
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,559
that's their end point of their foraging

1741
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,079
trip

1742
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,799
and in the classical teammates paradigm

1743
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,039
food is placed on one of the arms of the

1744
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,920
tea like the left or the right arm

1745
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,680
in this case we used an alternating tea

1746
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,400
base paradigm so the food would be on

1747
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,880
one end of the tea for some period of

1748
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,319
time and then it would switch to the

1749
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,160
other side of the tea

1750
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,599
so this is the the foraging task that we

1751
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,240
set up but this is just a map you could

1752
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,920
make it look like a labyrinth or it

1753
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,920
could look like anything

1754
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,520
in this simulation

1755
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,760
what happens is the ants start at their

1756
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,640
nest

1757
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,599
and then

1758
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,520
they implement a model which we'll look

1759
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,960
more at soon

1760
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,599
but the ant's action affordances are

1761
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,839
movement it can move in any of the

1762
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,400
directions that are surrounding it so a

1763
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,039
future model could have ant inertia or

1764
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,039
it could only move forward

1765
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,160
to the um sides like a pawn or something

1766
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,240
like that in chess

1767
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,720
it could rotate but we didn't keep track

1768
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,599
of the ants orientation we just said the

1769
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,240
cell is about as big as an ant and they

1770
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,680
can move to any of the adjacent cells

1771
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,440
and the ants able to perceive and act in

1772
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,319
those

1773
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,359
local that local environment

1774
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,400
and then

1775
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,440
we um use the following

1776
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,000
to parameterize the model so here we go

1777
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,920
a little bit blurry but there's a

1778
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,039
generative model which is just like

1779
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,200
in any other active inference model it's

1780
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,960
a generative model of

1781
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,039
outcomes and hidden states

1782
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,280
here the outcomes are the perceived

1783
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,960
pheromone and the hidden states are the

1784
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,319
true concentrations that are being

1785
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,799
inferred of the pheromone

1786
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,240
the um the the factors that go into

1787
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,240
the the markov decision process that's

1788
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,319
happening inside of each ant

1789
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,440
are um

1790
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,240
it's

1791
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,240
prior overhidden states

1792
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
the a matrix which maps from the hidden

1793
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,039
state to the outcome the b matrix which

1794
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,200
is describing how hidden states change

1795
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,480
their time

1796
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,839
and then policy which is suggested here

1797
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,480
to be influencing the transition between

1798
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,440
different

1799
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,920
states and the free energy minimization

1800
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,640
which dictates policy selection

1801
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,400
and then um we discretized the pheromone

1802
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,640
into 10 categories so there was 10

1803
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
possible concentrations of pheromone in

1804
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,559
this model

1805
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,680
so that's

1806
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,160
kind of setup of the model is food is

1807
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,000
going to be placed and alternating

1808
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,799
between these two sides of the maze

1809
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,880
ants are going to leave the nest and

1810
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,680
diffuse around with no preference for a

1811
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,599
direction

1812
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,520
except when they find a seed they're

1813
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,359
going to start depositing pheromone on

1814
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,240
their return journey and then

1815
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,400
they have a preference for walking

1816
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,880
towards regions of increased pheromone

1817
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,480
and it'll be shown that that is actually

1818
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,160
enough to recapitulate some of the most

1819
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,240
interesting behavior of ants like the

1820
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,720
ability to form a trail to food and just

1821
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,920
one interesting piece that

1822
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,119
differentiates

1823
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,039
the active inference model from

1824
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,720
traditional reinforcement or

1825
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,799
reinforcement driven

1826
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,680
uh notions of foraging is in those

1827
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,400
models the reward would be the seed at

1828
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,559
the end uh the food itself

1829
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,720
and that the cues

1830
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,799
would be the pheromone trail along the

1831
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,640
way the pheromone trail would be seen as

1832
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,160
like a means to an end and the seed

1833
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,760
would be like the goal

1834
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,960
but in active inference the reward in

1835
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,440
other words what the preference is over

1836
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,160
is actually over pheromone density

1837
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,480
and the seed is seen not as a reward but

1838
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,720
rather a semiotic cue

1839
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,119
to switch strategies

1840
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,680
so active inference really inverts the

1841
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,119
situation

1842
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,599
by making the reward about the

1843
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,400
moment-to-moment decision-making of the

1844
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,280
ants

1845
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,359
and then sees what is traditionally seen

1846
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,480
as a reward the food itself as actually

1847
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,400
just a cue to switch behavioral

1848
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,520
strategies

1849
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,960
so that's one of the most interesting

1850
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,359
things that we figured out

1851
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,880
so can i just comment in here really

1852
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,680
quick

1853
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,599
um just that that

1854
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,839
this switching task teammates is like

1855
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,319
it's a very simplified version of the

1856
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,960
switching bandit problem so we discussed

1857
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,680
the multi-arm switching bandit back i

1858
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,920
guess it was maybe 23 i don't know if

1859
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,079
you recall which live stream it was 25

1860
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,559
maybe um but it was back i think before

1861
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,440
the summer so um

1862
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,520
maybe 25 or 23. so

1863
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,400
that that live stream talks more about

1864
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,920
like a stationary band a problem and a

1865
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,280
switching band problem but had

1866
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,680
multi-arms like i think eight arms and

1867
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,280
here there's a link there's only two but

1868
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,799
i just wanted to draw the parallel

1869
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,160
between the two kinds of simulations

1870
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,359
it was um i just looked it up it was 24

1871
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,359
with empirical evaluation of active

1872
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,359
inference and multi-arm bandits this is

1873
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,680
a two-armed bandit it's a two-armed team

1874
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,520
maze but you can imagine

1875
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,960
the different switching dynamics or

1876
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,799
different number of arms so it

1877
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,520
absolutely is related to that

1878
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,119
let's go into a little bit more detail

1879
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,480
on the formalism and the model itself

1880
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,839
so here is describing the process of

1881
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,000
variational inference

1882
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,480
and specifically there's a q

1883
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,720
variational distribution

1884
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,119
that's being uh fit

1885
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,359
as a function of the policy and it's

1886
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,119
looking at the hidden variables

1887
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,960
pheromone density

1888
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,359
through from the beginning of time to a

1889
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,200
given time step

1890
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,599
and of policy so those are the kind of

1891
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,480
pieces that inference is being done over

1892
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,640
and then there's a generative model

1893
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,359
of the outcomes the hidden states and

1894
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,280
the policies so that's what the agent is

1895
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,079
doing variational inference on

1896
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,559
and that model doesn't need to be

1897
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,280
jointly considered all by all it can be

1898
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,599
factorized which makes it very tractable

1899
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,159
to compute

1900
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,880
and then given the factorization

1901
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,920
there can be a free energy minimization

1902
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,040
such that

1903
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,040
actions are selected

1904
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,719
based upon

1905
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,640
the optimization of this variational

1906
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,839
distribution

1907
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,279
in a way that it's

1908
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,520
selecting policies that are expected to

1909
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,679
minimize the free energy

1910
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,560
so that's in the appendix and these are

1911
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,479
some of the formalisms and it is

1912
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,359
minimizing the difference between the q

1913
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,158
variational distribution hidden states

1914
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,600
at time t

1915
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,759
given policy

1916
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,000
the difference between that variational

1917
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,839
distribution and

1918
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,238
this p distribution the actual empirical

1919
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,520
distribution

1920
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,679
which is over outcomes states also

1921
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,439
condition on policy

1922
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,560
so

1923
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,880
there's again so much to say about the

1924
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,640
active inference formalism but really

1925
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,399
importantly

1926
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,960
the calculations are conditioned on

1927
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,040
policy so it's like we don't need to

1928
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,198
calculate the exact momentum or

1929
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,120
trajectory of the car

1930
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,759
we need to pick a policy condition on

1931
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,080
what affordances we have

1932
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,080
and so that in a way

1933
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,479
simplifies and sidesteps a lot of the

1934
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,799
questions about wanting to describe the

1935
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,640
world to the highest possible degree of

1936
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,120
precision because actually what we want

1937
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,640
precision on

1938
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,439
is our policy selection so that's one

1939
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,120
key difference is that conditioning on

1940
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,319
policy

1941
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,279
and then

1942
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,238
this ability to do variational inference

1943
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,080
on a simplified and factorized

1944
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,799
representational distribution q

1945
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:53,439
and then minimize the divergence the

1946
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,000
expectation of the divergence

1947
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,920
between the q distribution and the

1948
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,000
empirical p distribution including

1949
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,400
outcomes so those are some of the pieces

1950
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,560
of active inference that help make it a

1951
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,640
really scalable and tractable framework

1952
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,159
here's the figure

1953
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,080
in the um

1954
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
appendix

1955
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,239
so we talked about the markov decision

1956
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,239
process and what some of these variables

1957
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,199
mean

1958
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,840
but here is like the center point right

1959
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,159
with this is where the ant is located at

1960
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,000
a given time

1961
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,960
and then what it can perceive

1962
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,440
and its action affordances as well

1963
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,560
are the adjacent squares so just like in

1964
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,960
the visual scanning model the i could

1965
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,719
perceive the center point and the

1966
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,080
adjacent cells here it's pretty much the

1967
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,840
same code actually

1968
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,920
that describes how even though there is

1969
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,360
a computational

1970
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:47,610
um

1971
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,880
[Music]

1972
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,719
object there's a variable that describes

1973
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,640
the actual pheromone density across the

1974
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,719
whole map just like there was an actual

1975
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,320
computational variable that described

1976
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,880
the whole pattern of the pottery

1977
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,320
we're able to

1978
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,000
use um a a remapping matrix

1979
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,880
that zeros out all of the other cells

1980
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,120
that aren't the adjacents

1981
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,520
so that is what ensures that each agent

1982
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,120
is actually doing a purely local

1983
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,159
decision making so we kind of take a per

1984
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,760
agent approach

1985
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,679
to masking

1986
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,560
such that its action and

1987
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,840
perception

1988
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,080
are constrained to only its local

1989
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,159
neighborhood so that could be changed

1990
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,920
you could have ants that are aware of

1991
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,320
ten cells around them but only act

1992
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,760
within one cell

1993
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,360
and those are the kinds of extensions to

1994
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,760
the model that could be done but we

1995
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,000
constrained perception of pheromone and

1996
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,040
action to just adjacencies

1997
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,960
so this is one thing that like i wish

1998
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,560
you guys would have played with um

1999
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,159
because what i would like to see is like

2000
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,679
okay is there something in my immediate

2001
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,280
proximity like i read like in the

2002
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,120
likelihood of remapping

2003
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,480
if there's nothing in the immediate

2004
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,360
proximity then the ant moves around in

2005
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,040
accordance with brownian motion as

2006
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,640
opposed to moving towards the pheromone

2007
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,560
and like i would like to see just an

2008
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,880
extra step of code if there's nothing in

2009
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,679
the nine let's look in the 25 and move

2010
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,400
toward

2011
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,560
the thing with the highest pheromone

2012
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,800
like that's one like because okay it's

2013
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,960
like a just a more distal like well like

2014
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,719
a trace of ascent or something like that

2015
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,320
yes it could be done

2016
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,960
it could be done by modifying the code

2017
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,920
so here's alex github

2018
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,480
and just look alec chance and ants

2019
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,800
probably a coincidence that it's in his

2020
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,719
name the last few letters but you really

2021
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,400
never know these days

2022
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,120
and um the main pieces of code to look

2023
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,840
at are ants dot py python

2024
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,600
that's the main script ants dot pi

2025
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,000
config.pi has a lot of the parameters so

2026
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,600
if you want to explore

2027
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,320
having just two ants in the nest or five

2028
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,000
million ants in the nest

2029
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,600
you can just change a parameter in the

2030
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,159
config file and then when the ants stop

2031
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,080
pi is run it's gonna like look at the

2032
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,600
config file

2033
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,560
to

2034
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,679
run

2035
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,520
and then figure one two and three are

2036
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,320
just for reproducibility to exactly

2037
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,320
reproduce the figures in the paper

2038
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,520
let's talk about the pseudo code

2039
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,239
so we can maybe go over the code during

2040
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,719
one of the dot one of the dot two but

2041
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,159
this is from the paper

2042
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,159
to summarize the computational activity

2043
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,920
of each forager at each time code

2044
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,000
pseudocode is provided here

2045
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,400
see the code for full details

2046
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,920
the active inference model as

2047
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,920
implemented here does not presuppose or

2048
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,239
imply any specific neurocognitive

2049
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,159
architecture for any specific ant

2050
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,120
species

2051
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,600
i believe that was uh some reviewers

2052
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,800
comments

2053
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,880
about what this did or didn't say about

2054
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,280
what was happening inside of each ant

2055
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,320
and again that's why it's so fun to talk

2056
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,480
about active inference and these broader

2057
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,880
philosophical questions while realizing

2058
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,120
that actually we're just looking at how

2059
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,880
sensory information comes in and what

2060
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,040
actions come out and the internal

2061
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,360
generative model can be a hypothesis

2062
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,640
that's informed by cognitive

2063
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,440
architecture but in fact it isn't that

2064
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,040
cognitive architecture it's kind of like

2065
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,120
black box modeling but then we can go

2066
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,880
into the box and start building sub

2067
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
boxes and hypotheses about what is

2068
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,920
inside

2069
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,719
but

2070
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,920
we don't need to presuppose any specific

2071
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,159
um cognitive architecture and in this

2072
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,560
case the ant has no memory

2073
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,120
and no anticipation so it's like kind of

2074
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,800
like a one step

2075
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,520
make a move towards the pheromone it's

2076
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,760
not predicting or remembering what's

2077
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,120
happened but what happens at each time

2078
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,640
step is

2079
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,199
it's like you know for each ant

2080
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,840
first the ant perceives the local

2081
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,320
environment that's the pheromone density

2082
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,360
it then updates or optimizes its beliefs

2083
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,199
about pheromone density

2084
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,960
with respect to the variational free

2085
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,800
energy

2086
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,280
it then after updating its

2087
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,360
distributional beliefs about pheromone

2088
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,800
density

2089
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,560
updates its belief

2090
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,760
about action so relatively given the

2091
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,199
affordances moving in different

2092
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,560
directions

2093
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,600
update my beliefs about how different

2094
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,920
action policies will relate to expected

2095
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,199
free energy

2096
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,320
so it's like let's just say there was a

2097
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,480
pheromone above but not as much below

2098
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,560
that would be perceived in in step one

2099
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,880
and updated in step two and then it'd be

2100
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,440
like well moving up

2101
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,760
will exp i can expect

2102
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,159
to be more like in my preferred state

2103
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,000
than if i were to move down

2104
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,239
and then action is sampled

2105
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:37,440
based upon the relative proportions

2106
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,960
of um

2107
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,600
the the relative free energies

2108
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,960
of the different

2109
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,840
action

2110
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
affordances so that action is sampled

2111
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,760
from that belief distribution action

2112
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,960
selection

2113
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,360
and then the agent performs movement

2114
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,560
and

2115
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,159
in the case of

2116
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,640
it carrying a seed so having already

2117
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,120
found the seed it deposits pheromone

2118
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,800
otherwise it doesn't deposit pheromone

2119
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,120
on the way out there are ants that

2120
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
sometimes deposit pheromones both ways

2121
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,760
but we were studying um the sort of

2122
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,560
simplified case where the ant only puts

2123
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,360
down pheromone on the way home

2124
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,120
so can i comment really quick on the

2125
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,520
neurocognitive architecture so again

2126
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,520
like after listening to the internalism

2127
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,280
externalism live stream 5.2 i believe it

2128
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,719
was um

2129
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,480
you know somebody asked that question

2130
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,400
and maxwell gave this great answer which

2131
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,080
i thought was was really cool like okay

2132
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,320
so where in the brain is the generative

2133
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,920
model in this like internalism

2134
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,280
externalism debate and that's something

2135
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,880
that we see like with the visual cortex

2136
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
mapping etc so where is the generative

2137
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,440
model and maxwell's answer was really

2138
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,600
cool like when you go to machine

2139
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,920
learning and you don't like look inside

2140
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,000
the computer for the generative model

2141
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,520
like where's the print of the generative

2142
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,880
model it's like software it's just

2143
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,040
running so i i always think that that's

2144
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,960
a really neat um

2145
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,040
and sorry sorry maxwell if i like really

2146
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
uh paraphrased you horribly because i

2147
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,920
may have but but but there's no need for

2148
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,520
the model to be

2149
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,760
necessarily inside the brain mapping to

2150
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,600
some specific brain region it can just

2151
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,960
be software that's just running

2152
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,960
yes figure two showed an example trace

2153
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,040
of just a simulation

2154
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,600
so the food starts off and um has not

2155
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,520
been discovered yet so like the density

2156
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,000
is low and it sort of starts here

2157
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,760
pure no pheromone then it's it's kind of

2158
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,000
follows like a zigzag and you can see

2159
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,679
like the food was on the right side and

2160
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,120
so there was a pheromone trail that was

2161
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,480
forming

2162
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,440
down

2163
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,000
to the nest starting up on the top right

2164
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,520
with the food

2165
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,159
and then the um it switches to the left

2166
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,560
side and so there starts to be pheromone

2167
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,920
laid down

2168
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,920
going towards the left arm

2169
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,600
but what's reinforced is still the trunk

2170
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,760
because that part is like good to have

2171
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,080
high density on no matter what

2172
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,000
and so that was our

2173
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,560
simulation this was a colony with 70

2174
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,520
nest mates over 2 000 time steps with

2175
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,080
three switches of the food location

2176
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,120
and

2177
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,159
we didn't optimize the parameters

2178
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,800
or try to like find the best performing

2179
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,159
set or

2180
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,360
um

2181
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,199
it was really just to show that this

2182
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,560
phenomena

2183
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,120
of a pheromone trail leading to food

2184
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,480
that can loosely track location of food

2185
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,080
changing due to the natural decay

2186
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,440
of the pheromone

2187
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,360
so informationally this decay rate can

2188
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,040
be thought of as environmental

2189
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,880
perturbation or drift that counteracts

2190
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
the reinforcing effects of stigmatic

2191
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,159
convergence or stigmatic tightening

2192
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,640
we were just like this is

2193
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,199
the first pass model

2194
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,080
that displays that phenomena

2195
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,360
and it could be optimized to explore

2196
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,199
how it works differently what if one arm

2197
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,360
is longer or all these different pieces

2198
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,199
but this is kind of what the model

2199
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,800
outputs and then in the supplemental

2200
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,280
videos there's a lot of videos there's

2201
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,120
some some large file size gifs of

2202
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,320
you can see the ants themselves

2203
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,760
diffusing around and then once there

2204
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,040
starts to be a trail they start to like

2205
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,040
really start taking advantage of it

2206
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,199
one of the

2207
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,440
pieces that was most exciting to think

2208
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,560
about was how do we measure foraging

2209
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,000
performance

2210
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,710
and this speaks to a common um

2211
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:32,080
[Music]

2212
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,640
area in studying collective behavior

2213
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,400
which is like how do we think about the

2214
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,000
relationship between individual level

2215
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
behavior and group behavior again we

2216
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,520
know that as we talked about earlier

2217
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,360
like the individuals r groups and so on

2218
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,440
but just looking at a two level model

2219
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,719
where we have like agents and then the

2220
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,800
collective

2221
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,000
what are the difference between

2222
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,159
individual and colony level traits so

2223
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,560
colony level phenotypes also that's why

2224
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,800
we use nest mate and colony level so

2225
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
that we don't have to use individual or

2226
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,280
group because nest mate is always just

2227
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,560
going to be an estimate colony means

2228
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,159
colony

2229
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,440
level phenotypes are summary

2230
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,840
measurements of emergent properties

2231
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,000
in that phenotypes do not apply

2232
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,199
to separate nest mates but they're

2233
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,840
enacted by nest mates and these are good

2234
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,520
citations to check out

2235
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,520
for example each nest mate has bodily

2236
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,080
phenotypes like the width of its head

2237
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,000
every nest mate has a head with or has a

2238
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,960
mid-gut gene expression profile

2239
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,880
but colony phenotypes are those that

2240
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,360
only exist at the colony level so

2241
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,600
there's only one measurement of those

2242
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,560
per colony like the total foraging

2243
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,679
performance or the average interest in

2244
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,440
internet estimate distance or the sex

2245
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,960
ratio of larva

2246
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,760
so which sex each larva is is nessmate

2247
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,520
level but this larval sex ratio only

2248
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,920
gets one measurement per colony

2249
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,239
and so we looked at two measures of

2250
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:55,679
colony foraging

2251
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,000
the number of foraging trips round trip

2252
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,520
completed through time

2253
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,560
and a swarm coherence metric

2254
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,320
so this is just the amount of foraging

2255
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,239
trips completed through time

2256
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,159
showing how as a function of the number

2257
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,320
of nest mates in the colony

2258
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,480
um you get different dynamics so for

2259
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,040
example 70 ants

2260
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,760
finds it faster the first return trip

2261
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,320
happens before the 500 time steps

2262
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,159
finds it faster

2263
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,960
and ends up getting more but potentially

2264
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,360
not you know multiple times is more so

2265
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,719
there's like some sort of a scaling

2266
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,480
relationship between the number of nest

2267
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,320
mates and the performance and then like

2268
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,280
look at 10. like it finds a few seeds

2269
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,639
this blue line but then it kind of

2270
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,159
flattens out

2271
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,760
so maybe the pheromone trail that the

2272
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,600
first few brought home just dissipates

2273
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,960
so then none of the other ones are

2274
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,360
really able to latch onto that trail so

2275
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,600
it has a very qualitatively different

2276
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,480
shape

2277
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,239
than the other ones

2278
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,760
and then this is the swarm distance

2279
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,440
coefficient which is like the average

2280
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,760
distance between the nest mates

2281
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,120
and so

2282
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,800
just interesting that again it could

2283
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,400
change maybe if you run it from work

2284
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,920
time steps or

2285
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,600
you have it in a different structure

2286
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,760
than the team is but it's almost like

2287
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,840
the distance increases as the ants

2288
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,040
spread out

2289
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,239
and then there's almost like a

2290
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,679
stationarity

2291
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,280
where the average distance stays

2292
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,440
relatively similar so these are just a

2293
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,760
few examples of the kind because you

2294
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,400
have in the simulation at least you have

2295
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,000
full information

2296
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,679
on the location of every nest mate so if

2297
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,520
you want to do an individual nest mate

2298
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,400
level

2299
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,000
phenotype

2300
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,080
you can calculate that trivially but

2301
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,520
then also there's this question about

2302
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,159
how do you summarize collective foraging

2303
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,280
performance

2304
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,960
so any thoughts on that

2305
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,520
so the choice to have full information

2306
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,520
on the location of every nest mate is an

2307
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,679
interesting one and um also like i

2308
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,239
wonder if it's a parameter that you guys

2309
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,320
tweaked or played with at all like what

2310
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,080
if you just have knowledge of half of

2311
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,440
the nesting locations

2312
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like you could almost simulate being a

2313
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,840
behavioral ecologist the grad school

2314
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,120
simulator

2315
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,320
where it's like

2316
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,360
the computer is simulating 100 nest

2317
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,080
mates but then you can only see 10 of

2318
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,600
them

2319
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,320
or or each ant can only see

2320
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,080
10 of them so we have full knowledge or

2321
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,440
the ants have full knowledge so that

2322
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,239
that was the question that i um have

2323
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,880
oh here we as simulators have the total

2324
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,639
trace of the simulation

2325
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,639
and one important piece that is not

2326
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,040
included in this was like interactions

2327
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,520
among nest mates they just passed right

2328
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,040
through each other

2329
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,440
in this simulation so that's definitely

2330
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,120
not too realistic

2331
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,040
and in nature

2332
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,719
the way that ants know whether they're

2333
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,960
heading inbound or outbound they can

2334
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,960
look at the polarization of the sun

2335
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,679
their step integration and the memory

2336
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,000
there's visual scene recognition and

2337
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,360
then there's also importantly

2338
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,040
interactions with other nest mates on

2339
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,520
the trail like if you're bumping into

2340
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,719
nest mates

2341
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,159
carrying food

2342
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,000
you're probably heading out

2343
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,920
and if you're holding food bumping into

2344
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,080
empty mandibled nest mates you're

2345
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,000
probably heading in and so they can

2346
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,520
combine all these kinds of sensory

2347
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,440
information to determine a lot more

2348
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,040
information than the kind of

2349
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,239
drift model that we instituted here

2350
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:15,440
well and and it just reminded me of this

2351
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,000
model that we just built with this

2352
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,239
foraging paper that i'm part of and um

2353
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,880
in that model all the foragers know the

2354
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,440
location of all of the food a priori

2355
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,719
right like so they already know where

2356
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,960
all the food is so so but learning where

2357
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,040
the food is is really like a whole

2358
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,880
different model right like going to get

2359
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,120
the food and modeling interactions like

2360
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,600
you know network formation in foraging

2361
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,520
patterns is different than learning

2362
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,199
where the food is how we learn from

2363
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,840
others this collective like learning and

2364
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,280
that's something maybe that's the

2365
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,719
difference between intelligence and

2366
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,480
behavior like you can just

2367
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,320
follow what other people do that's maybe

2368
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,239
behavioral but but like learning from

2369
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,320
others based on different cues and so

2370
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,639
forth i mean that that's a that's a

2371
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,840
maybe an intelligence metric

2372
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,719
let's return to this

2373
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,639
broader question about stigma g as a

2374
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,719
type of niche modification and how it

2375
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,199
plays a role in extended cognition

2376
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,120
so this is some

2377
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,280
nice writing by axel probably and

2378
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,520
referring to some of his work

2379
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,360
the representation of the environment

2380
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,760
leveraged to solve the tma's problem

2381
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,040
i.e the map

2382
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,360
is not the one entertained by nest mate

2383
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,480
brains

2384
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,080
but rather the one

2385
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,520
that is carved out of the environment

2386
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,679
and leveraged implicitly by each ant as

2387
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,159
they each forage alone together as a

2388
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,639
colony leaving cues that nest mates can

2389
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,880
use adaptively so i like that kind of

2390
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,040
like collective behavior as being alone

2391
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,080
together

2392
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,560
like each nest mate is perceiving its

2393
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,520
own

2394
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,320
umvelt its own local environment is all

2395
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,760
it perceives

2396
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,320
yet the way that the colony approaches

2397
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,840
this problem is truly collective as well

2398
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,760
as truly stigmatic

2399
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,920
in active inference terms the ants are

2400
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,920
endowed with only an extended generative

2401
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,960
model

2402
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,800
an extended generative model is one

2403
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,480
where some of the model parameters are

2404
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,679
encoded

2405
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,840
not by the agent engaging in inference

2406
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,719
itself but by the physical environment

2407
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,960
in which it lives

2408
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,960
so that's kind of like a person maybe

2409
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,840
can have a few numbers in memory but now

2410
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,520
imagine if you're hearing a string of

2411
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,840
numbers and you're writing them down

2412
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,840
and then you're able to go back

2413
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,440
and interact or somebody else could have

2414
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,960
written the numbers down

2415
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,199
you're going back and your generative

2416
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,239
model

2417
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,679
is functionally including things that

2418
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,199
are now part of the environment like

2419
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,880
they're outside of you so that really

2420
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,560
speaks to this integrating internalism

2421
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,320
and externalism

2422
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,560
and it brings up big questions like

2423
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,480
what other kinds of systems

2424
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,560
whether they're currently modeled not in

2425
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,080
the collective behavior framework or

2426
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,760
whether they're being modeled as

2427
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,520
collective behavior but not as stigmatic

2428
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,840
collective behavior what other systems

2429
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,600
can be modeled with stigmatic active

2430
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,360
inference algorithms

2431
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,400
and then

2432
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,639
what kind of individual level nestmate

2433
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,880
level behavioral heuristics contribute

2434
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,280
to adaptive collective behavior

2435
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,800
in the context of what kind of

2436
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,440
statistical regularities in the niche or

2437
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,159
regimes of stigma g because just it's

2438
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,719
not like stigma g equals adaptive you

2439
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,639
could imagine the switching teammates

2440
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,440
where they reinforce it too rapidly and

2441
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,679
then it is inflexible

2442
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,760
as the food changes location

2443
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,080
so it's not like oh collective behavior

2444
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,920
equals it's going to be adaptive or

2445
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,159
stigma g equals adaptive

2446
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,000
there's actually probably only certain

2447
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
combinations of parameters certain

2448
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
regions of parameter space

2449
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,320
in which specific environmental

2450
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:47,400
regularities can be capitalized upon

2451
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,560
so

2452
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,120
the idea that um

2453
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,719
the ants are only endowed with the

2454
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,239
extended generative model in the

2455
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,840
environment and i know like that in the

2456
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,600
paper they mentioned that memory is

2457
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,800
something that

2458
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,480
could be played with but i'm reminded of

2459
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,719
the story of hansel and gretel so like

2460
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,239
where hansel leaves a trail of

2461
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,239
breadcrumbs behind them so that they can

2462
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,719
find their way back home but um or a

2463
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,239
trail of pebbles the first time that

2464
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,639
were not eaten so you leave the trail of

2465
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,320
pebbles it's like modification of the

2466
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,719
environment but like if if you

2467
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,719
can just remember the way

2468
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,239
right like like that's that's an

2469
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:22,880
interesting dynamic between

2470
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,280
knowledge gained from environmental cues

2471
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,960
versus knowledge that's inherent and

2472
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,800
retained and and i know maybe you have

2473
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,719
maybe more to say about

2474
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,880
um ants and ant memory and where maybe

2475
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
these memories or or

2476
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,520
if there's some genetic memory for ants

2477
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,560
in different species or in maybe even in

2478
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,480
just single colony right like you've

2479
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,920
talked to me before about colony

2480
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,320
foraging behavior and even in the same

2481
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,840
species the foraging behavior is

2482
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,600
different and so

2483
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,480
i'm curious as as to your thoughts on um

2484
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,679
we don't have to go in right now maybe

2485
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,000
for next week but your thoughts on on

2486
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,560
ant memory and how that may come to play

2487
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,480
an interesting question i think

2488
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,960
species where the foragers head out

2489
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,320
alone for longer distances

2490
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,440
and need to find uh

2491
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,040
pieces of prey

2492
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,639
and bring them back

2493
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,120
we'd expect them to have higher memory

2494
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,880
whereas the extreme case of just the

2495
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,400
pheromone follower

2496
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,120
you know pheromone respecter ant

2497
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,880
maybe there's a very limited role for

2498
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,440
memory and then the question empirically

2499
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,480
would be

2500
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,320
are there morphological differences in

2501
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,880
their brain is the mushroom body smaller

2502
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,159
are there certain genes that have

2503
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,639
differential expression patterns

2504
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,280
how do nurses and forager

2505
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,920
differ in the expression of those genes

2506
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,880
like maybe nurses don't need to have as

2507
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,560
much spatial memory

2508
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,960
but foragers do need spatial memory or

2509
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
step integration for example it's been

2510
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,920
shown in multiple species that nurses

2511
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,480
don't have a circadian rhythm they are

2512
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,159
just sort of low-key working and

2513
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,560
chilling 24 hours a day

2514
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,120
whereas foragers have a circadian rhythm

2515
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,120
that's strongly in tuned by the light

2516
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,159
cycle

2517
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,040
so

2518
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,000
how

2519
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,080
does memory sort of

2520
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,360
start

2521
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,199
and then how does

2522
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:19,199
the temporal polyethyism and the

2523
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,040
trajectory of what the nest mate needs

2524
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,960
to do for the colony

2525
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,120
how does that lead to the development of

2526
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,280
nest mate level cognition

2527
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,960
and then how have the regularities of

2528
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,960
the niche selected for colonies that

2529
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,199
succeed by virtue of being composed of

2530
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,639
certain kinds of estimates that have

2531
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,600
certain kinds of memory

2532
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,159
this returns us to stigmergy so what was

2533
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,960
cool about this

2534
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,880
i just thought it was cool i mean i'm

2535
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,040
always looking for you know intelligence

2536
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,960
and behavior and how these two are

2537
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,880
linked together but but this paper which

2538
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,159
i found like

2539
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,920
self-published on amazon but i think

2540
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,600
it's part of a proceedings anyway it was

2541
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,400
just like a neat kind of um like google

2542
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,480
find uh it says stigmargy an

2543
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,560
intelligence metric for emergent

2544
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,760
distributed behaviors um and i'll just

2545
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,440
read this little piece of it it says the

2546
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,520
complexity of aggregated behavior often

2547
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,400
depends on sigmoidy stigma g occurs when

2548
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,400
behaviors by individuals modify the

2549
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,800
environment while being regulated by the

2550
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,199
environment state stigma has generally

2551
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,520
been studied for the forward problem

2552
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,360
predicting the consequences of local

2553
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,920
behaviors it is also applicable to the

2554
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,239
backward problem synthesizing local

2555
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,960
behaviors to fulfill a global need the

2556
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,520
concept provides provides an objective

2557
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,840
measure of intelligence for natural and

2558
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,840
synthetic systems a system's

2559
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,679
intelligence is measured by its amount

2560
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,760
of effective stigmargy it not only

2561
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,679
adapts to a changing environ environment

2562
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,920
but also modifies the environment to

2563
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,239
suit the system's needs and goals so i

2564
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,520
thought that this was just kind of a

2565
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,800
neat refreshing perspective on a lot of

2566
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,920
the things we've been talking about

2567
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,920
today

2568
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,880
agreed um intelligence is all

2569
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,280
is often thought of as just being like

2570
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,080
inside of a brain or in one

2571
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,040
agent

2572
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,600
when we know that that um

2573
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,520
doesn't take the brain body into account

2574
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,440
doesn't take the social into account and

2575
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,880
then even then

2576
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,159
that's where this paper came in was okay

2577
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,080
so then even social cognition let's say

2578
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,320
you integrate brain and body as well as

2579
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,360
a social

2580
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,639
you're still just in this floating mob

2581
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,400
type simulation

2582
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,880
how do we talk about the way that

2583
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,719
interacting agents modify their

2584
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,400
environment how that updates their

2585
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,520
tendencies

2586
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,440
that's where stigma g comes into play

2587
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,040
and that's why it was an important thing

2588
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,159
to do

2589
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,639
well and we're increasingly seeing the

2590
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:47,840
links drawn between cultural evolution

2591
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,320
and collective intelligence because as a

2592
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,440
species i mean we're still obviously not

2593
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,960
discovering fire

2594
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,719
and learning how to you know make

2595
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,159
buildings right like we already know how

2596
01:32:58,159 --> 01:32:59,360
to do that that's why we're not like

2597
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,840
living in these camps anymore and so

2598
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,239
we've evolved and you know none of our

2599
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,000
ancestors knew how to use an iphone but

2600
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,560
maybe you know in nine generations none

2601
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,719
of our none of our uh what are they

2602
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,800
called successors that that's what it is

2603
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,719
none of our successors will also know

2604
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,480
how to use an iphone so it's just us

2605
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,159
right now but everything that we do

2606
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,080
we're leaving these stigmargic traces

2607
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,840
behind in our environment that enables

2608
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,280
us as a species to evolve or become more

2609
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,519
intelligent for better or for worse

2610
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,679
anyway big questions so there's some big

2611
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,600
questions for next week that uh i'll

2612
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,679
give you to think about

2613
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:36,800
are you here

2614
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,080
so what is the relationship between

2615
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,440
collective behavior behavior and

2616
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,880
collective intelligence and i'd love to

2617
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,360
have other people's takes on this

2618
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,040
what are other possible measures of

2619
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,480
group synergy

2620
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,960
or colony synergy how are colony-level

2621
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,840
metrics retained in ants over time

2622
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,239
in this model forgetfulness is critical

2623
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,159
so do you think that the ability to

2624
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,320
forget is as important as memory in

2625
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,239
human or ant behavior

2626
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,239
um is stigma g a measure of intelligence

2627
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,800
or behavior or both maybe

2628
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,679
and then does trust play a role in you

2629
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,239
social insect synergy and i have some

2630
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:11,520
more but i thought that that was a good

2631
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,679
start

2632
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,440
all great questions i would

2633
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,280
yeah i think i got some dot one

2634
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,840
questions i got some dot two questions

2635
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,639
got some dot three questions but

2636
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,000
um this is an open line of research the

2637
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,480
paper was published only this year in

2638
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,679
2021 so if this is something where you

2639
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:34,880
think oh i have a theoretical

2640
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,639
contribution or

2641
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,480
i study archaeology and i want to learn

2642
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,400
how stigma g might relate to those kinds

2643
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,280
of models or oh i'm way better at coding

2644
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,760
than this and i could make dot dot

2645
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,360
improvement on the code

2646
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,040
let's do it

2647
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,280
so these will be fun things to discuss

2648
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,520
blue thanks for all the

2649
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,600
help on the xero in this fun

2650
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,480
conversation we hope to see

2651
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,280
many of you on the dot one and dot two

2652
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,560
in the coming weeks on the 21st and on

2653
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,000
the 28th

2654
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,239
and tucker in the chat wrote

2655
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:09,760
would love to hear and learn more about

2656
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,920
memory and collective systems

2657
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,360
totally agree

2658
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,840
and uh when we think of like the von

2659
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,520
neumann computer architecture it's like

2660
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,960
where's memory it's like i mean there's

2661
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,400
two spots where it can be right it can

2662
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,080
be in the hard drive long term storage

2663
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,480
or it can be in ram short term storage

2664
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,400
and then that has even percolated into

2665
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,159
how we think about short and long-term

2666
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,639
memory in organisms

2667
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,080
but now what about the niche

2668
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,600
modification

2669
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,119
what does it look like and how do we

2670
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,199
think about it is it simply that like

2671
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:40,159
data a is in short term and data b is

2672
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:43,520
moved to the environment or

2673
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,520
is something modified about the

2674
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,080
environment and something modified about

2675
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,920
the internal generative model such that

2676
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,920
the information can be recapitulated

2677
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,600
only through interaction with the

2678
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
environment

2679
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,119
how would we think about memory in that

2680
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,080
case and that's also um

2681
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,480
why ant colony optimization and swarm

2682
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,840
computation

2683
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,080
are part part of the broader umbrella of

2684
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,639
unconventional computing architectures

2685
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,600
because they do challenge

2686
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,199
or move beyond

2687
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,480
some of the sort of classical notions of

2688
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,760
memory processing bandwidth

2689
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,400
clock speed we didn't have to talk about

2690
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,199
that

2691
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,199
but those are things that

2692
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,119
studying natural systems

2693
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:30,080
makes us wonder about

2694
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,560
fun times blue

2695
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,760
see you soon

2696
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,360
see you later see everyone next week bye
