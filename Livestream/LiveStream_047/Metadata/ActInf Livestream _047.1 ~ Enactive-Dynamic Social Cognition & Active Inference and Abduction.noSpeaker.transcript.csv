"Unknown","00;00;27;24","00;01;03;04","All right. Hello. Welcome, everyone. It is active live stream number 47.1 on August 10th, 2022. And we're continuing our explorations into the paper dyad inactive dynamics, social cognition and Active Inference of Hippolyta and Venice and Active Inference and Abduction by Pierre Tanin and Bene. Welcome to the Active Institute. We're a participatory lab, an institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;01;03;13","00;01;29;06","Links are on the slide. This is recorded in an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for livestreams. Head over to active inference storage to learn more about other projects at the Institute and how to participate and join learning groups."
"Unknown","00;01;29;19","00;02;01;04","Today in extreme 47.1, we're continuing to learn and discuss this pair of papers mentioned earlier and on a previous video, and we're going to open with some introductions and then probably just jump in wherever anyone has a new question they'd like to ask. Maybe ending the introductions with Blue so that you can bring a new vector into the conversation."
"Unknown","00;02;01;24","00;02;40;00","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'm looking forward to taking a one lens a little bit to the paper, which had an extended dot zero as there is so much to learn on a few of these angles and so much to kind of think about that. What is the difference between being in the bathtub and then in the middle of the paper pair versus, for example, coming into it to contextualize it or trying to leave it to apply it."
"Unknown","00;02;40;06","00;03;07;18","Something in between, even there. I'll pass it to Dean. Thanks, Dean. I'm here in Calgary. I don't know if I don't know what the DOT one needs because we've never done a dot one where we've tried to pull two things but the proximal and see what happens because sometimes that's fire and water and just to get a lot of steam and sometimes it's nature on glycerin and the whole thing blows up on it."
"Unknown","00;03;07;18","00;03;45;16","So I'm kind of looking forward to that. That's kind of the risky part that I think is kind of exciting. I'll pass it over to student Oh, thanks. Dean Yeah, it's Stephen here in Toronto. I'm really curious around what this infusion of two different approaches to active movements can yield. So what's behind it or what's behind an approach of an activism that brings in instrumental is an approach that's more mathematically focused, bringing in realism."
"Unknown","00;03;45;16","00;04;14;03","So I'm curious and hopefully it's going to be useful and practical. I'm going to pass over to but I am blue, I'm in New Mexico. I really enjoyed reading. So I've read the I think we did the hip Alito paper before on another live stream and as I've read that one before, but I really enjoyed reading this abduction and active in French paper."
"Unknown","00;04;14;11","00;04;57;21","I do not have like a strong philosophy background, so I kind of come at this like with what is this? But is that like, I have to go search Wikipedia 100 million times to kind of get more information about. So from a philosophical aspect. And so one of the key things like where I was having a hard time, like locking in on this abduction paper active in France and abduction is why do first in blankets like like they presented the authors presented it as if the first like it's like necessitate a realist perspective."
"Unknown","00;04;58;01","00;05;40;19","So so is that true? And if so, why is that? All right. Thanks, everyone. So two threads blew in what I heard and I think two areas for us to kind of get on the slide and see at the same time. So one was like different approaches that can be taken both by an individual, like different backgrounds in different fields or disciplines, and then kind of going beyond one person's just learning trajectory and thinking, what are the conceptual approaches that we can take to, in this case, active inference."
"Unknown","00;05;41;09","00;06;18;11","But this might be studying active inference and applying acting inference kind of both ways might come into play. And then the question of the first and blankets, something like what aspects of what enable a situational realist or a instrumentalist? Just why are people taking the stances they're taking on a given situation sometimes even like mixed across different contexts for the same system, they might use one or another or something like that."
"Unknown","00;06;18;24","00;06;50;21","Steven And this brings action back into the equation. I sense that action is quite important because the idea of instrumentalist in a way is there's a use of certain instruments. And that's that's the best way to think of what's happening with the blankets. Actually, I think it's really cool that you brought the blankets up because that question comes in and it activates like the temptation is to make everything realist."
"Unknown","00;06;50;28","00;07;21;17","And then it's like, okay, we got a blanket. So it's kind of like, well, maybe we should make sure we keep the blanket question in an instrumental way to avoid all those traps. And then on the other side, it's like on the math side, it's like, well, these tension funded mental dynamics well, as they're being acted in some way, they must have some relation to reality in some way."
"Unknown","00;07;22;07","00;07;56;16","So it's sort of almost the mirror is not the mirror, but it's something that's sitting on the other side in an interesting way. I don't know what Dana thinks in that point, but I was going to mention that I, I think if we are taking two papers and actually doing a bit of what happens when they get entangled, then we're looking at what happens when something is actively inferred as a process as opposed to active inference as a subject matter or topic."
"Unknown","00;07;57;07","00;08;25;20","And so when we do that, we're essentially asking the big questions on one of the next slide here is so is active inference both as process, as actively inferring and of process, something falls out of that. And we, we asked it in the, in the using metaphor of being both a gripper. Right. Something as process thing and a process being gripped."
"Unknown","00;08;26;14","00;08;54;13","And so yeah, I think if we, if we, if we actually look at it as what's, what's going on, not just from the doing sense, but from the observing sense or participatory sense, I think it leaves us with no choice but to say that there's got to be some going back and forth between both. But that's just my take."
"Unknown","00;08;57;00","00;09;29;10","So let me let me read this quote from the paper specifically going back to to the blanket, the one that set off my, my, my question. But that's like unanswered. If says okay, according to recent interpretations of the FP, the dynamical interaction of living systems and the external world under active inference can be interpreted semantically. This is a Ramstad 2020 citation by assuming that sensory states are meaningful representations of the reality."
"Unknown","00;09;29;24","00;10;02;11","This is especially the case if we assume that the development of Markov blankets by Friston, unlike their original characterization and works of Judea Pearl on probabilistic causal networks, admit a realist interpretation of the relationship between the organism and the environment. So it says, while the role of the concepts of Markov blankets and Perl blankets in many treatments of the free energy principle is an instrumentalist one or as in Pearson's even stronger terms, concede to a nominal list interpretation of their meaning."
"Unknown","00;10;02;20","00;10;35;19","Fashion blankets are realist not only in the non instrumentalist sense, but also in the sense of being non nominal list entities. The modal terms of references to real possibilities such as what is conceivable or produced by imagination or anticipatory li related to the future. States of affairs are used in making sense of the key aspects of the theory and so in my recollection the first didn't think it like I didn't have that linked to realism necessarily per say."
"Unknown","00;10;36;08","00;11;08;25","So Daniel like maybe Kant, do you have any more clarification? Like, is that like a realist? A blanket is a realist interpretation of the blanket or or am I just forgetting that? But I read that part. I didn't know what Nominalism was. So according to the summary, the view that Universals and abstract objects do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels."
"Unknown","00;11;12;11","00;11;46;28","One version denies the existence of universals, the other the abstract. So it's an anti generalist position. So let's see where that was used with the first and blanket, because this is the crux of the discussion. Like one of the frontiers of contact other than just saying, well, and activism and dynamical systems theory work like this coarsely or this broad area math and chemistry work together like this."
"Unknown","00;11;46;28","00;12;18;08","This is starting to get into the real contact points of turf semantically that are being vied over. People have different perspectives on how to interpret base graphs in different contexts. And so then the mark of blanket is like it still might even be too coarse grains to for that whole turf to be controlled by one view or another."
"Unknown","00;12;19;03","00;12;56;17","So then let's look at how the abduction paper and anything else that you see, where would it be more justified, just in your sense? Well, and then we'll unpack this, because I think this was just copied in to discussed today, since it's obviously a clear area where both papers are talking about their view on the mark of Blanket, which might make it clearer to see how multiple views on blankets and graphs come into play."
"Unknown","00;12;57;07","00;13;34;04","But let's unpack both of their perspectives, saying the nominal list interpretation and as as you're unpacking that, it's something I didn't have to look up because it's a very prominent theme in Buddhism. Right. Like, like that, you know, it's like the absence of any kind of inherent existence. Like said, that existence is nominal. And so it's interesting that in this abduction paper that they take this this, you know, construction by Peirce of Nominalism."
"Unknown","00;13;34;04","00;14;39;11","But but also, like more than once in that paper, they point to an objective reality, which is like if if things are interpreted, interpreted, if all stuff is nominally interpreted, then what is the subjective reality other than like linguistics or semantics or perhaps semiotics? Yeah. So even that's a very good point because it also ties back to you mentioned about when we're talking about the relationship almost being the reality, I sense that they were kind of saying if there's a relationship, those relational dynamics, I didn't use the word dynamics, therefore have some it's can be called real, you know, which I think is a fair assertion in some senses, although, you know, again, that could"
"Unknown","00;14;39;11","00;15;06;01","be an overextension because there's a question about how much you go into transcendental and how much you go down into the kind of more morphology and the whole morphogenesis. And there's actually a really good there's a actual La-Z-Boy is actually it does a lot of work with search of the oppressed and work with people who've been tortured and stuff like that."
"Unknown","00;15;06;12","00;15;34;17","And he talks about the medicine is in the wounds, the medicine is in the wounds when people get no coma, etc.. And one of the things that's interesting there is that we may be in a culture, there's times when we might try to explain things or do transcendental work to to transcend a situation or avoid us. And we may actually avoid the situation."
"Unknown","00;15;34;17","00;16;09;13","But sometimes when you go into the wound, what you might find is is literally a bloody mess. So that may not be real in the normal sense. Then let's start out a little bit. I think it's interesting that most representations of Markoff, I could show the markup blanket in between to two distinct sets of properties and that's always represented on the horizontal."
"Unknown","00;16;10;05","00;16;49;01","And I think what's interesting here is that if if you exactly if you find yourself in a in a debate situation of two top down perspectives, one that says it must be from the top down and active or it must be from the top down some some series of some series or set of different logics apply depending upon your familiarity with what it is that you're observing, that can lead to that whole question of hierarchy, and then what entails the other."
"Unknown","00;16;49;01","00;17;31;08","So for me, it's pretty it's pretty easy to understand why people who take the exclusive position of instrumental ism as entailing something like logic or the other hierarchical relations chip of the logic being the real thing, and then the actions to follow, or that's the thing that's being entailed. I think what the diagrams, what a lot of the pictures tell us is that there's a lateral aspect to this as well."
"Unknown","00;17;31;08","00;18;20;06","And so if we're going to look at that lateral less which which is enveloping the other top down view because both of the views in both of these papers, if the bias or the the position that the authors take is one of top down, what what rules under this set of conditions or circumstances, placing those two things side by each strips away some of the questions around relativity and now introduces the idea of around relationship, but not relationship in terms of power over but relationship in terms of what needs to be present in order for somebody to be able to actually make fewer prediction errors."
"Unknown","00;18;20;06","00;19;08;00","So the mark up blanket, I think can be turned. I mean, right now, most of it is is perceived as being some sort of a vertical partition between lateral elements. I mean, it can be flipped. And we've talked often in lots of papers about what's the hierarchical structure, what's the bottom up, what's the top down. But I think both of these papers admittedly say we are taking a top down view of this and therefore they are constraining themselves to more emphasis on the relativity aspect of what is going on in in it in an actively inferring way."
"Unknown","00;19;08;00","00;19;54;02","Then they are looking at it as a relationship between the sensing and the act. Right? Well, a lot of stuff. Let's go through the abduction. Markoff blanket discussion. The first part is the statement of context, potentially for a philosophical background. But it's important that they're placing this along the lines of other places in biology. So these are systems that are self perpetuating in a diffusive multi-scale self way perhaps, but they're self creating."
"Unknown","00;19;54;02","00;20;23;21","We're not just taking them as existing in a certain contrived arrangement. 5 minutes ago we're thinking about systems that have maintained a non equilibrium steady state with their environments and if not the end. If someone denies the realism or the anything of the environment, then that can be verbalized and even cognizant. But it is not enacted by persistent systems either."
"Unknown","00;20;23;21","00;20;54;19","From the view from the inside or like if one just stops breathing or something like that, or the view from the outside. Because again, systems with persistent measurements have to be at least doing well enough to persist amidst the regularities, the environment. So this is kind of like grounding it in an evolutionary and developmental framework, but connecting it to the non-equilibrium steady state maintenance, which is grounding this realism discussion in a relationship with the environments, not as like in a priori."
"Unknown","00;20;55;16","00;21;28;22","Then there's a definition of Markoff blanket the blanket state conditional independence between notes in a base graph, which doesn't mean that influence doesn't travel or that those states aren't semantically about each other, but it means that they're conditionally independent in a statistical way. External states in supposed I'm not sure this author, but the end of Semiotic View would be like potentially meaning on the inside."
"Unknown","00;21;28;25","00;21;53;04","Like photons on the retina really are light. It really is the case that that's the real thing within that facet of biological function and internal states describe from exo's semiotic perspective. So perhaps like the interpretive view, so a view from the inside, the true influence of a of a feature, and the kind of studying of a view from the outside where those agree."
"Unknown","00;21;53;18","00;22;39;11","You have some meiosis like with a stop sign and it means stop in the situation with different entities. This speaks directly to active inference given that the regulation of the entropy of the internal state. So all these functions that we're describing as being like bounded or constrained or minimized or having to do with that interfaces surprise control on action, outgoing and then bounded, surprise on perception, which is also very force age by like the perceptual control theory and various motor theories which we've talked about, but like the reflex arc challenging the way that people models decision making, for example."
"Unknown","00;22;40;11","00;23;15;16","Then in many treatments they're agreeing that people take an instrumentalist usage or stance first, and blankets are released not only in the non instrumentalist sense, opens up a whole discussion with non and anti, but also in the sense of being non non ist entities. And then in this last quote, it would be great to hear more from the authors about what the modal terms of reference are."
"Unknown","00;23;15;25","00;24;04;24","But the part that stands out here is the real possibilities, because for these systems, with these features engaging in this way, their cognition can be considered real to the extent it has all of these features and is tied to the environment over time and so on. Hope that is one view on it because many paragraphs in the abducted paper and an inactive paper, if you really engage with their structured arguments, there's some much to like read in between and to respect the way that they've laid out the argument, while also hopefully now all seeing interesting ways to connect it."
"Unknown","00;24;04;24","00;24;33;08","So Stephen and then anyone else? Yeah, this is a little bit so feeding back to you, Daniel. So in case you've got a thought on this one, because the, you know, there's the, there's the, the biological aspect here that you bring it up. And I agree with that. And, you know, in the work on the brain just has been talking about moving from, say, a causal correlation to a functional correlation."
"Unknown","00;24;33;26","00;25;04;27","And there can be many ways of getting somewhere when it's functional. So then, right, of course, in this case, there's a certain element of what's real in terms of what we scientifically is. It's scientific realism. As a scientist, what is real in what's being scientifically deducted. So if it's been deductive, it is a perspective that's being taken. So within the perspective that's been taken on a certain state, it's not equal of Librium steady states."
"Unknown","00;25;05;07","00;25;36;03","Where is that regime of attention, the scientific regime at attention, purely an instrument to be considered? Or is it for the things it's analyzing that could be real. So there could be so the get out clause yet they could still be phenomenon rather than perspectives and logic sitting underneath that which have many dynamics to get to the same outcome."
"Unknown","00;25;36;03","00;26;05;10","So what's your thoughts on that then? My thought is I want to hear what Blue and Dean would say on it. Okay, come. Yeah, Steve first. Go ahead, go ahead. Loop each, you know, go for it then. I want to hear what you have to say. Okay. Well, what I hear here's an interesting thing about both papers and maybe, maybe the authors of the papers will push back hard on this, but that's what I'm used to."
"Unknown","00;26;06;09","00;26;28;26","Both papers take a scientific perspective on this, very much a scientific perspective, which in my books is easily as an idiom, is when I see it, I'll believe it. They want the evidence, right? They want it. They want that sort of inductive, deductive piece to sort of sit front and set. They want proof, which is great, I get that."
"Unknown","00;26;29;10","00;26;59;21","But what I think is really fascinating about this is while they are holding up that that epistemic priority, they're also talking a lot about, I'll invert that. And they say I'll believe it when I see it. So there's a lot of faith in this. It hasn't materialized yet, but if I continue to exist in a social setting or as an agent, yes."
"Unknown","00;26;59;21","00;27;32;23","What I've got to have faith that all this time that keeps rolling out, I'm going to continue for whatever purposes, goals or directives I'm taking to work through the not seeing it until I actually arrive at that moment where something materializes, when I can say, Oh, now I have the evidence. So there's are both papers. Have a real they play they play with themselves."
"Unknown","00;27;32;23","00;27;58;26","They dance with themselves in the sense that they are both papers from an exclusive standpoint saying we we are looking at this scientifically and mathematically. And yet in order for us to be able to hold on to this this this, this thought or idea of the ATP being, you know, I'm I'm I'm whatever it's called, steady state. I've just lost the expression."
"Unknown","00;27;59;07","00;28;26;09","Non-Equilibrium Thank you. Non-Equilibrium steady state. I do have to believe in something in order for whatever materialization, goal or outcome I'm I'm moving towards it. That's almost Oasis or Alice Thesis or I want a sandwich 5 minutes from now. I have to believe in that thing or my agency or my ability to achieve or attain before I can actually have that thing."
"Unknown","00;28;26;26","00;28;50;21","So from from from that alone, I find it really interesting that there's a certain amount of naivete in both papers. There's a kind of a we have to keep our hat to this rookie view that every time we realize something, there has to be a little bit of faith or a little bit of belief in what's going on."
"Unknown","00;28;50;22","00;29;26;20","Those priors actually exist, and I'm going to use them because I want to carry out whatever my priorities are. And it doesn't matter whether it's the top down newness of abduction and logic or the top down units of an activism, they both tip their hat to the bottom. Happiness of I got to kind of have a I got to kind of have a confidence that so that even if it's not here now, at some point it will either continue the way I want it to or whatever change I want to impose on it."
"Unknown","00;29;26;28","00;29;56;10","I have that capacity to wait it out and have that thing happen. So yeah, that's what I would add to what Steven was saying. Luke Yes. So, so I'll say a couple of things that I was looking at just now, the difference between a Christian like what is a Christian blanket? And I came across a paper that we're going to have to discuss."
"Unknown","00;29;56;18","00;30;28;18","It's called Scientific Realism about Christian Blankets Without Literalism, and it's by Christine and Kirchhoff. So someday we're going to have to have that. It's a preprint up on philosophical archives now. So so apparently like having a real boundary can be like literal. Like there's like a literal interpretation or a realist interpretation. And so just like I'm still trying to narrow down like what is this realist interpretation of a Christian blanket?"
"Unknown","00;30;28;18","00;30;53;22","And yeah, so in also a very real sense like what is the real boundary of a living thing? Like I don't, I can't find my real boundary. Like, where do I stop? And something else begins. There are like hundreds and trillions. I don't even know more non human cells in my body than there are human cells like. So I always have to come back to this."
"Unknown","00;30;53;29","00;31;18;07","So what would I be without all of those non-human things? Are those non-human things also me like but then like, you know, I'm constantly like ingesting new ones and excreting old ones and so like, and they're coming into my skin and leaving my skin. So where is my boundary? Like, do I have to have this boundary in order for active inference and like the Markoff blanket interpretation to apply?"
"Unknown","00;31;18;07","00;31;43;22","I don't know that that's necessarily true. So like I could just get off of it. I love this paper and I love like the semiotic interpretation in like the objective sense. Like, but does it even really matter? Like like so the realist interpretation, like to someone who doesn't believe in like a shared objective reality is never going to work."
"Unknown","00;31;44;24","00;32;11;00","Or like, can you find the boundary? Like where is this line between self and other or like between like like I can't find the boundary. So like for me it's all a modeling perspective that doesn't lessen the impact of this abduction as active inference paper for me at all. Like I really thought it was a great paper and has a lot of really cool things to say about cognition and perception."
"Unknown","00;32;11;11","00;32;34;01","So like, why are we hung up on this still? I don't know. Or both of you go for it and then I'll add some notes. Could I just add one more note? Yep. I mean, I think look, I agree with totally with Dean on this this bottom up phenomenon. You know, that's that's going to be there in the background."
"Unknown","00;32;34;07","00;33;01;02","Maybe it's always going to be unknowable, apart from some of these simulations giving us insights. But I think also what Blue is saying there is for me this whole boundary question is where is the problem with a systems discussion in terms of that being kind of naturalized? And I think that it because you end up with because systems are defined that way, what's inside, what's outside."
"Unknown","00;33;01;17","00;33;27;09","And for me, the big revelation and I think for a lot of people, maybe in the biological sciences, it's not so unusual to think this way, but to think about agent based modeling, to think about where where's the agent, where's the agency, the teleology. And that agency doesn't necessarily sit on a boundary in the same way that systems tend to."
"Unknown","00;33;28;04","00;33;45;27","I mean, someone could argue that it doesn't have to, and I'm sure it doesn't, but it ends in many ways ends up there. Right. In reality, in terms of discourse. So, you know, we want that discourse to be clear. We're doing this work with systems engineering to have it where we want these clear divisions for the purpose of ontological discourse."
"Unknown","00;33;45;27","00;34;13;28","So we know what we're talking about and why, however, which is where maybe there's a challenge this agent agency, teleology, gee, morphological dynamics are something else than that. And I'll pass that to Daniel and maybe his answer will come in somewhere. I'm not sure. Yeah, Dean first. Then I'll go for it. I'll be real quick here. So in some of the diagrams, I know that, Daniel, you're you're you're really good at this."
"Unknown","00;34;14;09","00;34;36;19","Some of the diagrams, the markup, like it is literally a an oval with the word discrepancy in it. And so all I would to to to add on to what you were saying is that if you want a hard physical boundary and you want to discover what that is, I think you're looking at it again. What where is this?"
"Unknown","00;34;36;26","00;35;01;16","Where is does one thing and and another thing start as a relativity question? What I'm suggesting is if you're looking at the bottom up and the top down as a relationship, not as which is which is more powerful or holds more influence over the other, you're looking at that as a relationship. And it's that relationship holds as a discrepancy zone."
"Unknown","00;35;01;29","00;35;30;02","It's not necessarily something that has the physical beginning and end. It's kind of it kind of fluid. And it and it's it's not to say we shouldn't look at the relativity at all. It is to say, let's have one eye on the relativity piece. And the other eye on the relationship is the discrepancy between it doesn't it doesn't lend itself to hard stops."
"Unknown","00;35;31;25","00;35;58;11","It's discrepancy if that's all that is. That's just what it is. It means we're not sure about anything other than the difference. We don't know where where the separation boundary is. But that's kind of where this rule. Let's bring these two papers together thing came from, because if we're actively inferring, we can bound around that discrepancy. It doesn't always have to be a partition."
"Unknown","00;35;58;27","00;36;40;17","That's what the that's what the importance is. You're potentially if we can have two things being held simultaneously or co-occurrence. All right. Wow. Well, well blocked there. Well, first one, the discrepancies textbook figure to three, discrepancy. Not a blanket or discrepancy as blanket of blanket, etc.. And that can be a continuous or discrete value. But in non idealized like non singular path of least action settings a.k.a real settings, there's always a non-zero value."
"Unknown","00;36;40;17","00;37;19;20","So that's one way to leave the door, always a little open in a way that just having to feed on zero or one or any rapid switching strategies of zeros and ones doesn't really capture that in the same way then. BLUM Great question. Like we asked a little bit about at the beginning, why? What is leading someone to consider something like a blanket in a realist or an instrumentalist light and pointed to factors like the persistence of the organism and the reality of like the action inflow with its environments."
"Unknown","00;37;19;20","00;37;42;23","So it kind of forces somebody to say, well, if the environment is real, then the entity and the actions and the meiosis of their actions are real. If stop signs are real and stopping at a stop sign is real and they're all part of the non-equilibrium steady state, what, what further realism does one want to know then that there is a territory and then this is the maps of the territory."
"Unknown","00;37;43;07","00;38;23;28","So some are going to go all the way into territory skepticism or how will they then reframe their stance then on the just a few other random pieces, this was in Live Stream three when we read about communication and active inference. And they are, which is a lot of in the social and action setting that we're bringing this objective light to the social and active setting that's really like expounded upon in the Polito and van ass paper that that goes into a lot of the scientific and philosophical aspects of social."
"Unknown","00;38;25;03","00;39;03;11","So here they're borrowing from the framework of Tinbergen for questions and providing multiple scales of analysis that are all like the four whys. And these four Ys are kind of like a two by two quadrant. And so then that allows in biology parallel of research agendas and integration because like the fact that brain regions are connected to each other up here on the mechanism side is part of the picture, but it's a yes."
"Unknown","00;39;03;11","00;39;23;19","And with the pattern of DNA divergence times like you could imagine situations where they're correlated or not and they could be causing it or not, and it could be either way of causation or a confounding factor or any other number of things. And then neither of those have a direct closed door on like what the birdsong sounds like."
"Unknown","00;39;24;02","00;40;08;06","So without even going into what the birdsong is like, interpreted as there still is space within that interpretive or semiotic scientific approach, that is hopefully as we can explore, considering the research in that application in a different way than it's been partitioned in certain specific analyzes in the past, then well, so I'll, I'll throw something out there knowing that I had not really thought about it more than while I was listening to you talk."
"Unknown","00;40;08;25","00;40;37;02","So if it's completely wrong, somebody can can correct me really quickly. I think it's really interesting that both of these papers provide what I would consider to be a stable or a stabilizing effect on what we might describe as something resembling strategy for the potential for strategy. What I'm always thinking about is that strategy is not behavior behaviors."
"Unknown","00;40;37;15","00;41;09;09","Usually, given the label tactics, but that strategy does include the anticipation and the logic that is applied. And I think that's where we're not in conflict. When we say there's a triadic and there's a code construction of the social scene, because I think both of those things provide the still stability or the platform then to strategize and minimize those prediction errors."
"Unknown","00;41;10;08","00;41;43;16","So again, we can still we can still build off of strategy and do and we can still build off of strategy and eliminate constant, bad, consequential decisions. So, again, that's the relationship as as opposed to which one of these two approaches, these two top down approaches is the is the thing that holds the most sway, because at any given time, well, one or the other are both."
"Unknown","00;41;43;23","00;42;14;08","As long as you don't get trapped in one would actually be the most I would think would be the most option generating, not option. So I think as you talk in the adduction paper about the different types of abduction, what they do handle, they emphasize all of that in the end, both of those types, the generating and the selecting are essentially you can't you can't have one without the other."
"Unknown","00;42;14;25","00;42;46;23","So that's an interesting thing to incorporate here as well, or at least considered. I'm not saying you have to take it up, but if you did, what would that look like or just directly respond to a few pieces there, then Steven and then anyone else. So very interesting connection with Multiscale prediction error or free energy minimization uncertainty reduction surprises abounding in Multi-Scale systems."
"Unknown","00;42;46;23","00;43;33;06","And then in this social and active setting that Hippolyta and Vance brought to the forefront, that is our gripper and grips in a way that a little experiment on a fixed mirror, active inferences item or a system described by any of the conventional mechanics, classical physics, mechanics, statistical thermodynamics, quantum you're kind of just going off on a prelude to upcoming discussions with Dalton, but I think that will pull out an aspect which is that the Bayesian mechanics broadens that discussion into the cognitive dynamics of active particles."
"Unknown","00;43;33;27","00;44;02;02","And so in that way, a ball following becomes like a special case of active particles falling that could take various paths based upon their embodied affordances, even if just described as, if like the baseballs not following the parabola equation, but that's how the real environment and active particle interact, which is to say some melodically, which is why they both papers mention abduction in the social context."
"Unknown","00;44;03;05","00;44;31;16","And then you mentioned like these two top down perspectives and how when we have the divergence between among like multi three body problem, we have multiple ideas, minimum of two, hopefully more. And then there are strange attractors. There's, there's Lifestream 32, there's life from 26. Everything happens in that space from the top down because there's always going to be a plurality from the bottom up."
"Unknown","00;44;32;03","00;45;17;08","So the one error that wouldn't just be the right course training for sure is a singular I of more laser. And that leads to basically the unexpected, unexpected with the reality of the bottom up. And then when there's divergence is in continuous state spaces and paths in between top down, then there's a bi directional relationship with the top down in the bottom up or the inside out in the outside in, because you could even move among those without feeling like we were like violating a system to sometimes use a left to write for time, or then we could use right to left for time."
"Unknown","00;45;18;12","00;45;46;07","And so seeing those kinds of cognitive moves as accessible in a social setting and then taking that course. Lastly to you said that the two stroke engine of abduction with the generating and selecting because the laser is not on the generator and that's the about the analogy of attention in a top down system like we've seen models and mental action several times."
"Unknown","00;45;46;11","00;46;18;29","Stephen Yeah, thanks Daniel. You would, you really go back to that four by four that you had there with the ultimate yeah. And I think that this is really important because there's also this implicit enlightenment assumption that was always sitting in the background where up is good. And I think it's really interesting that and I think you're absolutely right, we talk about it talks about ultimate."
"Unknown","00;46;20;00","00;46;43;09","So I think it's really curious and it talks about we talk about this interactions is this kind of interaction. This is the ultimate set of interactions, the robin and that is what the truth is seen as what's the rational truth when we go up and we get enlightened. So then we can project down on what's there and the idea of that, what's coming up is interaction."
"Unknown","00;46;43;14","00;47;05;04","So that's the general way it's thought. And there was this magic box called Emergence to sort of get around the fact that really we didn't know. But I would I would challenge that not not to say that that's not true in terms of how it's perceived, but there's another way that bottom up can be explored, and that is another way that truth can be explored."
"Unknown","00;47;05;04","00;47;36;28","This is rational truth and this which I thought ultimate is quite I get the sense that that is very much looking out as this is built into those words. Right. This assumption that of of enlightenment. But there's also intimate truth. Intimate truth is different to rational truth. And intimate truth is not about interactions. It's about knowing. It's about a deeper kind of knowing."
"Unknown","00;47;37;17","00;48;04;27","So when I go down, it's not what's coming up in a bottom up. It's, What am I going? Well, my only way to engage it is to go down into it. Does that make sense? And that going down into it is also valuable. Is no more primitive than enlightenment. And I think that that that goes to sort of the very foundation of the assumption, which we don't even notice."
"Unknown","00;48;04;27","00;48;32;13","It's there about science that everything is trying to be enlightened. But that is only partially true. And I think biology sort of knows that. But maybe can't speak to it. That's that's my little piece that to try to connect that one layer closer to, I think, some academic traditions, but by no mean a normed ones. But thanks, everybody, for sharing those."
"Unknown","00;48;32;29","00;49;05;26","It reminds me of the direction taken in the one of the biographies I'll paste in the title here. This is Evelyn Fox Keller's biography of Barbara McClintock and the title is A Feeling for the Organism, and that takes a history and philosophy of science informed view. Like What is the feeling for the organism? How does one have a feeling for the chromosomes like this?"
"Unknown","00;49;05;26","00;49;34;18","Belief that there were jumping genes from certain psychological observations? And then how does that really play out when somebody is in a context of professionalism and like expectations around different people who look different and so on? So that takes a holistic look. And I think there is that on every or many cases that kind of story to tell."
"Unknown","00;49;35;17","00;50;25;00","And so that is one bridge of connection, blue from like the evolution standpoint. And I think like part of the question that Steven asked earlier, like, can we take multiple trajectories, be it like top down, bottom up to arrive at the same conclusion or the same like end point? And this is something like in evolution, there is like convergent evolution where, you know, completely different genetically unrelated species will arrive at the same trait or develop a very similar appearance that makes people think like, you know, before we had DNA relationships like we would we had species lumped together because of their similar appearance that we're actually completely like unrelated, like we're very distant on the"
"Unknown","00;50;25;00","00;50;56;10","phylogenetic scale. So like it's an adaptation that we converge on the same feature or we converge to the same argument or the same like place in some kind of space. And this is something that I think about a lot and just going to like the the quantum perspective, like can we you know, all go from, you know, point A to point Z, like traversing a different trajectory."
"Unknown","00;50;56;10","00;51;28;00","But like if everything is time reversal, then that's not really possible. Like we can't converge to the same point. Like we have to follow a specific path if time reversibility holds true. So I had to just like, throw that in there. Interesting note. Let's kind of return to some of our earlier frameworks, but fun stuff, I guess we knew we wanted to cover the mark and blanket."
"Unknown","00;51;28;11","00;52;01;05","We have explored some of the threads that justify the realest or even further stance, though we still have a lot of questions for the last 20 minutes or whatever about like what leads somebody and what the implications are for being different stances, causes and consequences of different stances. Why does that matter in general? Studying crystallography? Why does that matter for the social setting like decision making in governance or organization?"
"Unknown","00;52;02;12","00;52;32;20","That was a justification broadly for abductions capacity to be compatible with active inference and form type of probably valuable relationship. Both directions because active inference gains. These cognitive features that were described before these graphs were invented analogous to kind of Blue's suggestion that there was classifications that were some were really insightful, others were false competitors or lump beings or whatever."
"Unknown","00;52;33;16","00;53;05;00","Before there was a way to look at it differently. That is some of what grounds a realist interpretation. So again, we're still not fully closed on what it means to be realists or what matters. But now let's go to the Mark Blanket in action concept and similarly break down their angle on the blanket and understand maybe what leads them and what their suggested implications are for that stance."
"Unknown","00;53;05;00","00;53;55;15","What kind of a person do they think they're being by taking this cognitive social position, which could be asking both papers and all speech action and then where's the beef? Then what is the what is the between there? So anyone can go for it. What is something to bring in about an action blankets and or how everything is brought together in Hippolyta and then us 21 just go take your time."
"Unknown","00;53;55;15","00;54;46;10","So one of the things that I really like about this paper is, again, it's the time it takes and that that they heavily emphasize that as part of this code construction that that enables people to gain some sense of what it means to be in a now social situation. In fact, they they talk about that. I'm not sure where it is in the paper, but they talk about the fact that people that are that are new to a cultural setting, it requires of them some time in order for them to be able to pick up on the non linguistic, nonverbal, non expressed information that's being passed within that social realm and that they're not picking"
"Unknown","00;54;46;10","00;55;17;09","up on. So, so what, what enables that and that's when they spend little bit of time sort of talking out why that could only be then considered a co construction the more you do within that condition, the more you pick up, you can't simply be watching. You can't. It's in fact, the transition is going from spectator to the actual doer."
"Unknown","00;55;17;20","00;55;56;00","And so that's that's a heavy that's a heavy burden to put on the statistics actual landscape as you don't sort of sit there and go, okay, so what's the probability that this person who I can't really understand because I don't what link don't even know what they're saying because they're speaking a different language. What's the problem? A bit like you don't sit there and kind of do those kind of calculations or maybe you do, which is just not aware of it, and you're not spending a whole lot of time with your calculator out trying to figure out what the what the distribution is."
"Unknown","00;55;56;15","00;56;29;06","While you are trying to co construct or co coordinate your your active involvement in this new thing that you're now trying to be a part of. So that's one of the arguments that I really like about their paper. They basically say, in order for this to work, first thing we have to appreciate is that there is a temporal commitment to making anything happen going forward."
"Unknown","00;56;29;06","00;57;01;09","You could if you don't have that temporal commitment, if you check out before you've even checked in, nothing changes, nothing happens. So from a markup blanket standpoint, that that essentially goes back to the discrepancy question. Is it is it is it a hard boundary? Well, you can perceive it that way. There's this limitation now, because I don't speak their language or you can look at it is now what is this what is this evolving discrepancy and how does it change?"
"Unknown","00;57;01;09","00;57;59;26","How does it shift? How does it do deviate and then re conform, eventually oscillating down to some sort of agreement? That is the instrumental piece. I'm just saying most people aren't sitting there calculating that out as it's as it's happening. They're basically just trying to figure out what it's all aiming live want to bring in anything on and action blankets instrumental ism and then we can after that look at what the inactive writers say think it's been says like in the in the in activists and instrumentalist blanket perspective I don't know that's always tends to be like the classic way that I think about it but let's let's see what the authors say."
"Unknown","00;57;59;26","00;58;22;24","All right. Let's see in the first half how they set up this question and then we'll end with a fork in the road that we can discuss. All right. So they start with similarly defining blanket. We we could look at the word overlap in the future, but it's scale three tool. Don't know if Scale Free was said in the other situation."
"Unknown","00;58;23;27","00;59;13;19","It's introduced as a statistical tool that allows us to interpret and then again we see allow for interpreting. So the language has already conveyed certain flexibilities if one is to take a charitable though narrow reading. So this isn't the only way to read, but just in terms of how below the surface an argument is framed as an as in addition to the direct rhetoric immediately moving to the relationship with the physical boundary in the abducting case, we saw highlighting of the reality of the closure of the action and influence loop."
"Unknown","00;59;14;21","00;59;47;19","But there wasn't a justification of a physical boundary. And so I do think it is interesting the earlier discussion with like how does the multi-agent or like agent based model perspective as a scientific tool help us model blurry systems as like swarms that are a certain resolution or density away, then going straight to the first in variant of the Markoff blanket where there are already active and sensory states rather than introducing it first."
"Unknown","00;59;47;19","01;00;12;28","In the general case like that, it's about statistical insulating sets that can then under perhaps some situations be partitioned to like an incoming representing sense and then an outgoing representing action aspect. And so those are the blanket states sense and action as in a here and then be in there. Figure one is the box around S and A and then the ether and the MMU."
"Unknown","01;00;12;28","01;00;34;05","They're like kind of like flips of each other. I don't think that's the only reason why they're those letters and they don't have to be those letters. None of them actually have to be those letters. But this is the connectedness, structure or sparsity of what both the authors are describing. All right, then here's the fourth. It is possible to understand active in Frozen two ways."
"Unknown","01;00;35;28","01;01;07;21","I think we each had a few ways of just today, a real few that the properties of the models should be expected to exist as an ontological property in ontological being like not in the use of using the active inference ontology importantly differently enough, but rather describing the philosophical, ontological or real basis. That's why it's associated with realism."
"Unknown","01;01;07;21","01;02;07;28","Then the second way is the non realist view that the model is simply an instrumental tool. So we're at the fork of these two directions. What is the moved in my my sense the move is that so what does that not make up a whole and I'm not saying that in the title logical sense I'm saying if we're actively inferring as opposed to looking at a topic that's titled active inference, don't we want to incorporate the entirety, the complexity or for the sake of for the sake of being able to to understand an action is is active inference kind of is it a my question would be how is active inference actually being used in"
"Unknown","01;02;07;28","01;02;32;25","each of these papers? Is it is it is it is it found in the argument that we don't want to get completely complacent around theory to other minds, or is it sitting on top of that kind of the ice and kind of the way it can make sure that we don't go too far off the rails? My argument is that it's both."
"Unknown","01;02;32;25","01;03;15;21","If we're actively inferring blue, any thoughts? I don't know. How is active investing used in each paper? I just want to go like look like. Like what is the drive home message? I mean, maybe that's something that we can leave for the dot to wish the graphical abstract right for all of these strings. Well, it is hard to fish stuff out of the abduction paper due to like the lack of figures."
"Unknown","01;03;16;02","01;03;52;23","I had to, like, go find my own figures for the pretty picture. Okay, let's look at one layer deeper at the the three ways that they suggest that one can be a non realist about markup blankets. It'd be a whole nother intersection map with whereas non realist anti-religious pro instrumentalist just we could do political compasses all over the map and there would be even second level questions about how things are defined and what periods of times."
"Unknown","01;03;52;23","01;04;25;10","And you just it's all good. And so we try to follow these again. I like Dean the way that you've brought it back to like navigating in this continuous space between two ferns, between two at minimum. And then that stays in a kind of dynamic navigational setting. It's then if you're the moth, that's if you can't go too close to the lantern, either lantern."
"Unknown","01;04;26;11","01;05;05;20","If you hit one, then you die. So your flight stops there. So that, I think, puts a very meaningful interpretive layer because just like I mentioned, the figures help with interpretation and shorter lists help. Like there's three reasons why I'm against this. Here they are, one, two and three. Those are important structures. Yet also, there's a reason that people don't communicate through outlines outside of certain situations."
"Unknown","01;05;06;06","01;06;02;09","Okay, say tangent, but what are the three ways that they're suggesting? One can be a non realist about markup like it's what meaning less semantic tools this is going to be I think very interesting they do not hold semantic value, interpretive value, linguistic or otherwise other than that constructed by using them to understand or predict behavior. In the situation where the scientist is studying the stop sign, they could say you have the statistical edge for me at mind is being used instrumentally and there would be a valid stance, but especially when we take this semiotic view which is very similar to semantic and they have similar seed, but the semiotic this with a stop sign"
"Unknown","01;06;02;09","01;06;25;14","and the actual stopping and the social and action of stopping and the development of the agent that led to them having that belief in that context. That isn't just setting it up in terms of merely propositional logic, which we hinted towards in the DOT zero and many, many of the peers in the comments dot org articles lay it out much deeper."
"Unknown","01;06;25;24","01;07;05;25","But abduction is not a static set of rules alone. The generating selection cycle includes, at the very least, structured novelty arising from internal, external and everything in between, and a continuous type attention distribution and strategy on attention and so on. So it's a much richer setting than potentially semantic, which can mean in certain settings symbolic, which is to say the kind of symbolic logic carried out by like a Turing machine, which can still be extensive."
"Unknown","01;07;06;04","01;07;51;06","So even a generous interpretation is still very plausible. But there's something different about semiotics and the bio semiotics that was mentioned in the other paper that is not one in the same as the researchers modeling of. And that was also explored well by Yellow Bromberg in the 2016 paper. The Anticipating Brain is Not a Scientist, which contrasted a scientific analysis modality with the cognitive system as cognizant and distinguishing cognitive science in a way from that through ecological psychology, the Yeah, I was just going to tag on to that."
"Unknown","01;07;51;06","01;08;16;18","I think in order for this to happen, I think in theory it's easy to say we don't place a waiting on our priors by simply doing. I remain objective throughout all of this, but I don't think that most of us, even when we take that really strict scientific stance, are aware of the priorities and the weights that we have."
"Unknown","01;08;17;14","01;08;55;15","Even subconsciously apply. So again, I think I think you can say there's no there's no value add to this. I'm just I'm just I remove myself from it and I'm just a passive observer of it. But I'm not sure how how long we remain passive before we start applying weights and values to what it is that we're we're analyzing especially in a situation, especially in situational analyzes that are personal and the consequences fall back on."
"Unknown","01;08;55;18","01;09;51;04","So now if you're simply watching something and there is no consequence upon you as the observer, maybe that's easier to do. But if you get to a place where the scientist part of the experiment, wow, show me how that that switch gets turned off and you don't place a waiting on something very powerful and true. And in many ways, implicitly and explicitly, the kind of messaging sometimes that I see in the information environment is about getting people to update their priors, to believe that they're included in a larger, which is an absolutely valid communication and perspective and the how of the path and the homeostasis and the multilevel system and the critical path it has"
"Unknown","01;09;51;04","01;10;43;21","to follow, including reflexivity and narrative and anticipation. And this bottom up, top down aspect, it's that is social and action. Like people can argue that there's different social structures and different settings and it doesn't have to be a top bottom. It doesn't have to be any specific metaphor or cycle psychoanalytic like lens, basically. But the one shortcut to collapsing all of that complexity into a data point, the this one trick is to approach it like an experiment because that is what the experiment is in a way it is about finding a manifold where it's like this tube has this strand of DNA and this set of things, and then that allows the the paint on"
"Unknown","01;10;43;21","01;11;15;07","the wall and all these other factors of the true context to be isolated from. That's kind of like the partial information encapsulation or just any other type of system. And then potentially we see like with Quantum. Yes, some persistent anomalies that suggested things were not always as they seemed. However, the real case study is not the quantum mechanics, but it's the Bayesian mechanics."
"Unknown","01;11;16;00","01;12;05;00","With the psychological study and the neuroimaging study and the behavioral study by all kinds of people in all social and action settings. And that really does point towards some of the deeper implications of interaction is formal modeling of social and cognitive systems. One could step out of that real life and enter into another and and situate themself from like a third person perspective and look back onto this single path plane and see that as an experimenter."
"Unknown","01;12;05;19","01;12;34;20","And that is in many ways associated with metacognition. However, can that observer claim realism versus instrumental ism? What where people speaking in terms of that view, I don't know. Just bringing up that sort of like, are you, where are you? And that really relates to the self-concept of Blue brought up and like the kind of situating this with the self-concept and then realist instrumentalist."
"Unknown","01;12;34;20","01;13;23;13","But let's move on through these points. Second reason why one could be a non realist of America blankets. One could merely view them as valuable fictions. Yes. Okay. That allow abstracting certain features of phenomena. But a valuable fiction one could ask are all of the generated interpretation? Is fictions valuable or not? Or so does saying it's a fiction and saying everything is a fiction is that in what ways is that instrumental or in what ways is that realists making a real claim that that is the stuff which all things are, though it's not of the stuff that potentially somebody was taught about atoms in a certain classroom."
"Unknown","01;13;24;09","01;14;11;21","So the persistent divergence can some to think that one of those is scientifically grounded and another is metaphysically grounded and or open to preference, faith or other perhaps preferences and concerns entering that discussion. And then the third one is, you could be a non realist about moral blankets because just because it's the success of the use of the moral blanket justifies, the acceptance of the epistemic value of the model without necessarily making ontological claims, in other words, just because the physical model is fitting well doesn't mean it's really an AP cycle."
"Unknown","01;14;11;21","01;14;56;04","Just because the circular orbit models fitting well. How well? 99% until somebody comes along and goes 99.9 with a totally different model structure. So it's kind of like saying how how sure could you be about a realist interpretation of the structure of the model when as part of one's commitment to the scientific, they might leave the door open to some future model with higher explanatory predictive power design and control, etc. Then yeah, that's and I don't know where it is in the we actually had it because I was looking at the slides from the 47 zero this morning and there's a there's a part that's highlighted in the other paper, the talks where Peirce says,"
"Unknown","01;14;56;04","01;15;26;02","leave the door open. That's what addiction is about. It's simply the door is ajar. You don't have the certainty, but you have enough of you have enough information to make a hypothesis, not an explanation to best or not something rather to best explanation. But you can now you now have something to move off to to leverage off. And that's because the door was left open."
"Unknown","01;15;26;14","01;15;57;03","So again, you can come at it from you can come at this conclusion that the third one, the success of the Markoff blanket through the instrumentalist lens. But there's people on the realist side that are saying the same thing. The more open, the more likely it is that you'll actually get to the specifics sooner. Here's a fun at example analogy to kind of bring it back to Stephen's earlier request."
"Unknown","01;15;57;03","01;16;43;23","There's a faster is slower or slower is faster. One can just imagine both ways. But the empirical finding in ants is that during certain escape evacuation situations like leaving a room where alarm pheromone has been spread, that when there's like a constriction in the exits. So the morphology of the nest that they've constructed when there's a constriction that situation in car traffic jams and in people crowd situations can be very deadly and that can be associated with like a crush situation or a liquid too solid, like jammed in and then a fracture which can have all kinds of issues on the center of where it happens."
"Unknown","01;16;44;19","01;17;16;24","Whereas in the ants they slowed down their individual movements. So it wasn't like some orderly queue. Everybody get in line and now we're going to wait for number so-and-so be called. This was like their response in the situation to the bio semiotics and the niche construction of escape right was a slower is faster response such that yes their morphology as ness mates helps them like by having legs that are wide out."
"Unknown","01;17;17;18","01;17;43;10","They're physically insulating. So it's not to say that that is the single thing for a human to semantically keep in mind in a physical escape setting. But active inference lets us pull back to those different settings and at the ants and their view from the inside the end of so meiosis like the pheromones perception in the neurobiology of the nest mate."
"Unknown","01;17;44;00","01;18;21;11","And then there's the exothermic with the scientist, and then there are instruments in play. DIN So you're not thinking through amped minds that would be to M instead of teaching more. However, there is a sense that there is there is a hive mind at work, even though you cannot necessarily share that hot hive mind. There is no blending, there is an autonomy."
"Unknown","01;18;21;28","01;19;11;01","And there is a sense that if if I am a believer in the top down version, which is enabled by an activism, if I'm a believer in that, I can also understand without thinking through the mind of a realist, what that realist perspective is. So you're not weird? I would say that what Thomas and Inez wrote from that, from a logical standpoint makes a lot of sense, but that doesn't disqualify from my my thinking and, this other way of thinking from coexisting and and and having I don't think I don't know the answer."
"Unknown","01;19;11;10","01;19;45;19","Watching Daniel or not, maybe they are. I mean, maybe there's another narrative that Daniel will share with us about when the ants became aware of him. But I'll just tell you a quick story. I feed Magpie. I think Corbett's and what the of realized is it's me because they're very quick to recognize faces and what they do is they return the favor I get I get little little I get bones from from from dead things that they've eaten."
"Unknown","01;19;45;28","01;20;19;17","I get the bones set on the same rock that I place the the dog food on because they love this this fish flavor, dog food. They actually return things and contribute back because they want me to continue that cycle. So I don't know if ants do that, but I do know I do know that other species, whether they would describe it as knowing my mind, certainly want to influence my behavior from a strategy standpoint."
"Unknown","01;20;19;17","01;21;02;16","Awesome lot of points there. So that's in contrast with a framework like Panpsychism or like the absence of psych ism. So just totally putting aside many of those questions you describe like a pan intentional stance ism, a pan strategic AM that allows for complex hollow violence, blue's microbiome as well as the human dog supply chain Crow setting, allowing for those to exist and be modeled by like decision making and control theory, game theory, etc. because of the pragmatism of the game."
"Unknown","01;21;03;17","01;21;32;14","It is like a doorway into considering all these situations as something to play, some games to signal through, some games to win in this way or to have this outcome. So that's pretty interesting. Then there's thinking through other species, that's a very interesting idea and be cool to design experiences like games or art that could allow for different kinds of communication."
"Unknown","01;21;33;03","01;22;13;16","And then on the point in the objective paper about the economy of science, which we can return to that discussion of Pearson's concept, it's like thinking through reviewers minds. And so just seeing also facets or thinking through my chess opponent's mind. It's not a total emulation but note, but being able to generate interfaces, affordances, policies. There's so much in a partial information situation that the entity has generate and the generation scope means that there has to be a strong selection mechanism too."
"Unknown","01;22;14;00","01;22;56;17","And those are the cycles of temporal objective logic which breaks us out of the inductive deductive, static, conceptual dialectic. And this brings pragmatism, action, ecological psychology and so on. So it's really fascinating to see what is flowing within that space of formal models of perception, cognition and action, which are thousands of years old. And it will be important to understand so many of these different threads because they're not all quantitative."
"Unknown","01;22;57;15","01;23;23;17","And the abductor of paper and the social and active paper are demonstrating two of the most important areas where that's the case. Then. Yeah, I just want to real quick on that. So it wouldn't matter if I decided that I wanted to do a situational analysis and based that on the very real gifting, gifting size going on, or at least I'm interpreting it as a gifting exercise, that would be one approach that I could take."
"Unknown","01;23;23;24","01;23;57;17","The other approach I could take would be a very instrumentalist one in terms of token exchange. Either one of those things would work, putting them together like might be even more addictive. I'm not sure. I don't think it would be confusing. I think it would just provide two lenses on the same on the same process looking at I have to lead on that as is figure two and three."
"Unknown","01;23;58;11","01;24;31;12","So here is a perspective on social construction that they're pulling from non in activist or non active inference perspectives. The difference with Figure three is the social action, and figure two under the active inference framework is the coupling. And so there doesn't seem like there be even one kind of thing that would be captured by this gray box in the middle of Figure three."
"Unknown","01;24;31;12","01;25;20;17","So play it safe. Take an instrumentalist perspective on this gray box. It's one very important node in interpretation and then pass that through the tubes to the objective reviewer who looks at it and says yes. And the social actors are engaging in objective logic. My background in Peirce suggests that abduction, primacy of the generation selection and the time dynamics and the flow of action with the environment from Pearce's work abduction can be interpreted in a realist framework."
"Unknown","01;25;20;17","01;25;52;09","So this can be held instrumentally with this view, with this I and one can then ask whether the abduction that you're modeling it doing objective logic may even be able to hold an instrumental stance. But Is it instrumental for the social actor for the end of semiotics instead of from the Exo Symbiosis Blue? So you kind of took the words right out of my mouth there."
"Unknown","01;25;52;10","01;26;36;21","Good job. So, like, is this gray box, this sociocultural meanings, model based reasoning, like can those be subsumed under CMOs? Are you asking can it be a filter? Like is excessive meiosis like the imputation of such sociocultural meanings and model based reasoning is that extra symbiosis from the definitions that I've seen in the usages I've seen it XO means from the outside and means insight in general in scientific words."
"Unknown","01;26;36;29","01;27;09;21","So meiosis is the meaning construction process. So exo symbiosis is a view from the outside. For example, looking at that stop sign situation unfolds, looking at that aunt pheromones situation unfold. Whereas the end dose of meiosis, the interpretive semiotic process by which something comes to have an internal meaning, which then could be asked whether it's in a symbolic or a cognitive or an intentioned way and all these different aspects."
"Unknown","01;27;09;21","01;27;42;26","But I hope that that's an accurate distinction. You actually are you are you trying to make this simple for my little brain? Are you asking whether not a person can take a third person perspective? So I'm just trying to understand, like the symbiosis is very clear to me, but but like this exo symbiosis, like when I like look it up, right?"
"Unknown","01;27;42;26","01;28;15;21","Right. Like so, Anderson, meiosis is like the signal transmission into the interior that's like and those symbiosis like the right like the interpretation of science into the inside. But like this exo symbiosis is like between organisms, like the silent and signal transmission between organisms of the same species or of different species, like, for example, the thermal. Like that's what I read as exo symbiosis."
"Unknown","01;28;16;01","01;28;39;11","So when you look at that figure three like is that not exo symbiosis? I mean it looks model representation and what was the other thing in there? So looking for the here's a fun view I think on the exo so yes I think we're in agreement here and the symbiosis is like the signaling within the organism or the view from the inside."
"Unknown","01;28;39;11","01;29;07;14","But that right there is the heart of also the boundary as a physical versus boundary as a functional. So there's a whole complexity with bio semiotics, which is usually I think why people talk about the bio semiotics and just recognize the complexity rather than take a stance too early on that partitioning. But then this one is the axis and like perspective constructing messages to alleged extraterrestrials."
"Unknown","01;29;07;14","01;29;50;16","So if we look who are the others, who are the authors of that paper, they're listed here. Douglas A coach. But yeah, let's well so so just this like sociocultural meaning imputation and like in the mean paper that Daniel and I just put out and in with RJ and Rachel the semiotic representation is culturally like relative. I mean, like, there's no a stop sign that isn't going to be a stop sign to like someone in like the aboriginal like very like native primitive like lifestyle, right."
"Unknown","01;29;50;26","01;30;14;22","And so the this exo exo semiotic is like a transmission between organisms of the same species, but like also like the same culture I would say. Because like how do you you can't like and even I don't know if that's true. And pheromones, like if segments of different species mean different things, like the same pheromones can have more than one meaning."
"Unknown","01;30;14;22","01;30;50;28","Is that also true or the same, like kind of molecular compounds. I mean, I think we probably don't know enough. I think I think I understand what you're asking now. Is there is there an assumed sense that there they're some some type of form of entanglement has to be present for any of that to make sense to make sense implies that something has existed that didn't maybe exist in the in that in the distant past."
"Unknown","01;30;51;04","01;31;37;09","It wouldn't exist in a different context. So so that's why the socio cultural meanings like, like I think of that as like exo exo some exists like you I mean kind of goes without saying that there's just different closeness is along different axis like people who are speaking the same language but different vocabularies or you know, the situation matter so much the body language then, the more distal or different the cognitive structure is relative to what it becomes harder to, quote, put yourself in their shoes and so on."
"Unknown","01;31;38;22","01;32;13;03","And I feel like that's a question with the multi scale system phenomena is whether they're dissipative or persistence, diverse intelligences, understanding what the water we swim in is cognitively and linguistically because the water we swim in, some of it is going to be the signal or something else. It could be the influence signal, like the B matrix in active influencing causal relationships in the world as part of the water you swim in."
"Unknown","01;32;13;23","01;32;53;08","It also could be like modifications through stigma, e.g. niche modification, like your physical influences, which might be the water you swim in, in the sense you don't notice them. Like many things that come out of and through us, we don't direct awareness of. So they're like the paint on the walls in that PCR experiment. It's amplifying the DNA because it's the parts that, whether we like it or not, they get condensed down to a dot or a path and then that becomes, ah, like sense making from local partial information, as if a lot of the invisible part we could just disregard."
"Unknown","01;32;53;08","01;33;17;17","And we do cognitively like we talked about like the exhaust heat with Chris Fields in quantum like you have to burn information to pay attention and and you have to pay attention to deal with a real complex niche. So there's a lot of tensions in that path and especially with this dyad and I'm sure so much other related work."
"Unknown","01;33;17;17","01;34;00;17","But with this dyad and I think with the lens that Dean, you helped approach it to with it is putting some of those threads into a different light, and especially for those who in this semiotic way add some Bayesian surprise, some cognitive state updating from any number of different things. That's like proof of concept social in action, but not in a corroded or in a performance art."
"Unknown","01;34;01;09","01;34;30;04","Although who would say it's not performance art but still way that brings the realism into the social through the formal and doors. Dean And then blue, I think, I think I see both of these papers as pillars. I see them as really stabilizing for different reasons. And I would rather stand on both of my feet and have something stable under both of them than try to stand on one or both these standing on one cylinder."
"Unknown","01;34;30;12","01;34;57;13","Because I find that I find that just based on my more and more difficult. But as as we tried to take up this new season of live streams and bringing two things together that felt like a frontier moment. And I think that one of the things that I hope we have conveyed is that looking at two things at once is by nature more complicated, not necessarily complex."
"Unknown","01;34;57;13","01;35;23;16","The complexity exists in each of the papers. But two, to look at two things at once is more complicated and therefore is more fraught with the error of the trial and error relationship. I'm not saying that we made it much mistakes, but I think the first the first rule of generation is you won't get it right right away."
"Unknown","01;35;24;04","01;35;56;11","You will have to again have that temporal commitment in order to be able to get wherever the heck you think you're going. And I didn't really know where this was going to go other than I wonder what happens if we don't narrow our regime of attention and necessarily know we were widening it. But I did know at some point we might get the authors coming on and asking us, asking us why these two."
"Unknown","01;35;56;11","01;36;27;04","I don't think it has to necessarily be these two papers. It's just that both of these papers create and create a nice symphony, right? So it could be any set of papers. It takes a chocolatier or a wine connoisseur to really make the pairing special. Yet there's other situations where any pairing can be potentially fruitful and insightful. Like, sometimes I think about that in a community context."
"Unknown","01;36;27;04","01;36;47;11","Like you're always going to share between zero and one context, and wherever you are on that continuum, the parts where you're sharing is awesome. In the parts where you're different. We can also respect as great or the overlap between two papers. Well, the word used was opposite or it was like contrary in some other way. Okay. And then with a stance."
"Unknown","01;36;47;15","01;37;16;27","So then I thought of the kind of like games where people have to stand on a single pole in a, in a tropical, beautiful location and try not to fall. So I thought when you have both feet, like you said on one position narrow then Buffetts of wind are assaults on your equilibrium steady state, especially when it's like which one of these one person is going to be a professor just as an example."
"Unknown","01;37;17;29","01;37;52;07","So why not resist and return to a fixed mode? Because that's like sort of the mode seeking that we heard about in some of Dalton and Maxwell's recent work. The fixed mode is the center of gravity. And then another way that you describe with I kind of having like a nonzero divergence and the space between is like in basketball the triple threat stance because you could dribble or pass or shoot by like going for the basket."
"Unknown","01;37;53;05","01;38;29;12","And yeah, that's a different stance. And it's also in a field of affordances. So it's not just that they're in a different position. Like the feet here are not much wider than the feet here, but this is the invest again mood, as Peirce would have maybe alluded to it, that in a context with an action, ecological psychology, all of that in a context with an instrument and a game and something outside the game that supported the game."
"Unknown","01;38;30;16","01;38;58;15","All those levels are in the triple threat. But how did I get here? Why am I on the green one is a limited context and I still think that, yes, it's still highly skilled. Nobody's questioning how how much energy is being poured into doing that. And that's that's hard work. And there's a huge reward for doing it well."
"Unknown","01;38;59;02","01;39;30;10","And there's many. And so I totally agree. And even intend that people could have trained a lot for this one. This could be someone who doesn't play basketball. And so that's why it has to be a little dynamic and situational, but just seeing them as kind of like extreme modes of paper interpretation in an extended paper interpretive metaphor, one could see different modes of receiving some meiosis from literature or discourse."
"Unknown","01;39;30;29","01;39;48;00","And then what is the role of participation and feedback. And then that multi-agent setting that we mentioned, I hope that's not too random in our last. Yeah blue go for it."
"Unknown","01;39;50;00","01;40;16;08","So one like pairing of papers that I would have liked to have done is this objective reasoning paper with the Chris Fields quantum paper, the one from the 40 like because I was just reminded of it so much as I was reading through the paper and just like learning about objective reasoning and what does that look like and how like we, you know, in objective you don't have complete information."
"Unknown","01;40;16;08","01;40;43;22","It's like partially observable. And so like you just make your best prediction from like a partial observation. And it made me think of like the quantum reference frames where you don't like it, like you can't get full overlap with someone else's quantum preference frame. Like, like it's not like even with perfect learning, there's still going to be some noise or some overlap between the quantum reference or some incongruence."
"Unknown","01;40;43;22","01;41;23;10","The quantum reference frames, some area that's not overlapping. So, so I don't know, I just those two things that's like one pairing that I would have liked to see that's that's really interesting. Like as alluded to earlier, the quantum broke the glass on the reflexivity question in philosophy of science. I hope that's not to overstated to say and it wasn't the only piece in the building or the weakening of the glass, but the earlier mentioned persists."
"Unknown","01;41;23;10","01;41;56;25","An anomaly regarding experimental context expanded the scope of certain questions in science beyond discourse in certain cultural circles during the last like 500 years that Stephen alluded to parts of so quantum is where abductee of temporal relationality it's there when you see it now, it's not proto active particle of the electron or just a pebble. This wouldn't be happening."
"Unknown","01;41;57;15","01;42;39;23","Or if the electron were a pebble that were bigger, this wouldn't be happening. But would it not be or would it not be happening because we could measure it better? All of those questions about points and particles and waves under Bayesian mechanics as a mechanics for cognitive particles, the reflexivity now can flow in not just from electron scale, but I feel like there are multiple contact surfaces with reflexivity at the semiotic narrative ecological."
"Unknown","01;42;40;03","01;43;13;24","The real scales outside of the experiment. And I think that is what partially speaks to the way that we entered this dot one discussion. So in our last five or 10 minutes, what would we like to have or note talked to just to the authors if they listened to this in the time between or not? We're looking forward to talking to anybody who wants to, whether it's for the DOT to or any point in the future."
"Unknown","01;43;13;25","01;43;40;25","There's always a dot three avoidance. So we hope to continue this discussion with those who have authored and those who have not not yet authored, because there's so much to build on, on on this vector. So both of you don't feel free to as long as you would like, just mention any points that you want to discuss for next week Dean had brought up earlier."
"Unknown","01;43;40;25","01;43;59;14","Like where? Where is active in France? Is it is it the basis is it like resting on top of is there some kind of duality there? I think that's something that I would like to kind of look back at each paper and and figure out, like where I where, I want to put active inference in that pillar or on that pillar."
"Unknown","01;44;00;29","01;44;32;04","Or is it the pillar? I don't know. Yeah. Are we going to be able to go with our active inference colored highlighter and say okay these two words yet or you know this clause. Yep, this paragraph with this paper or this interaction of the paper, this tool developed by the paper, where would one be to highlight how I saw the paper?"
"Unknown","01;44;32;04","01;45;01;07","And I know Stephen would completely agree with you. Can I just get you to put behind where in brackets when is active inference? Because again, I think that matters so much about inductive logic and rest reduction. The other thing is, is that I, I hope that that lose thinking about well, what, what if we pulled other papers and entangled them."
"Unknown","01;45;01;07","01;45;32;00","What what might that. I hope that's an opening. I will say this it takes incredible amount of preparation. If all two papers together and not do the proper respect for the amount of work that the authors, the originators of that work have done. So whatever the whatever the preparation is in terms of quantifying it for a single paper to it justice, it's many multiples of that to two papers."
"Unknown","01;45;32;00","01;45;59;02","But I think if we are going to be active and first not just subject matter experts on activity trends, that that exercise is difficult and is time consuming as it is. It literally, literally changes that game because we talked about the game here quite a bit today, which again, I didn't think that was going to come up, but thank goodness, did because it's not oppositional."
"Unknown","01;45;59;05","01;46;27;00","The game can be everybody gets in the canoe and works together to arrive at Hawaiian Islands. That can literally, literally be the game. Right? It doesn't have to be a competition. It's not a race. It's do we survive given the limited amount of information that we need to glean here as as as important to our are our we are ability to continue on."
"Unknown","01;46;27;00","01;46;54;14","I think that's what being an active employer is. That's where we shift from a subject matter expert to a prediction matter expert. Actually transitions. So I want to thank people again for what feels like hanging yourself out there in a real risky way because it is risky if that's what it is. Thanks again. There's so much to say."
"Unknown","01;46;54;14","01;47;29;17","I hope that it's an honor and a privilege to be in epistemic spaces and have one's homeostatic variables secured. So that opens up an amazing space and approach. The temporal aspect of abduction sounds so great to return to because I think another one of those points of contact communication is the dynamic. What were the only formal isms in either paper in terms of like equations and mathematical symbols?"
"Unknown","01;47;29;17","01;47;59;18","It was three representations of dynamical systems of happily to invent s to connect and ground a contact point from where they were taking a stance and and a skilled performance into the mathematical symbolic scientific. Someone says this paper is a philosophy paper. Yes, but it has equations. So that is going to come to be something different. And then you start reading a paper, change the game."
"Unknown","01;48;00;05","01;48;44;05","But reading multiple papers changes the game and it is in a way true. It is more rides to keep in mind because at least under some norms and preferences for paper discussions like personally I prefer and find myself at home when people don't extensively speak from what a person thought and take the end semiotic perspective from them or from like a whole culture which seems implausible to me, but situates the semiotics of themself in relationship with a non-trivial and a symbiosis."
"Unknown","01;48;44;25","01;49;19;26","And where do those two threads meet? The blanket, which is in potentially its most elegant course screening represented by the gray box here. And why would we want to delimit or even grip? Maybe the gripper that we have at this point are like car pliers and this is something very different and or something active. So at this or any point in time."
"Unknown","01;49;19;26","01;50;16;19","It seems absolutely valid to look at the structure of Figure two and three and hold so many stances at once or in rapid navigation. So wow, what a fun discussion. Thanks, Steven, for joining and Blue and Dean. And we will look forward to some interesting times in the data and beyond. So peace out."
