"Unknown","00;00;21;29","00;01;03;13","Hello everyone. Welcome to active live stream number 47.2. It is August 17th, 2022. And I'll just quickly update the video. Now it's really August 17th. We're having our third discussion of the set of papers in active, dynamic social cognition and active inference and active inference and abduction. Welcome to the Active Inference Institute. We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing apply to active inference."
"Unknown","00;01;03;14","00;01;29;18","You can find us at links here. This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for livestreams at active inference dot org. You can find out more about participating in projects like The Live Stream and also a lot of other learning groups and projects ongoing."
"Unknown","00;01;31;03","00;02;01;17","We're here today in our third discussion around this dyad of papers, both from 2021 active inference and abduction and inactive dynamics, social cognition and active inference. So check out 47.0 and 47.1 for more background and to kind of get up to where we are now, let's go to the introductions and then we're going to take it where it goes."
"Unknown","00;02;02;08","00;02;43;07","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll pass it to Dean and then to Steven. I say, I am Dean. I'm here in Calgary. I guess I'm still a researcher, although I'm a retired, basically. This is this is an opportunity to have one of the authors with us, which I think is fantastic and essential. We sort of take this from all the things that we've set up to now and get an opportunity to just sort of it through the lens of of the authors."
"Unknown","00;02;43;07","00;03;26;19","And so that I'm really excited about that as we speak. Thanks, Dean. So, yeah, I'm Steve and I'm based in Toronto and I work a lot with spatial meaning making participatory theater and dialog approaches and yeah, I'm very pleased to have the author here today, one of the authors and also to for me, I'm really interested in what we're doing here because of the ability to get beyond what's often just called emergence, emergence through the mind body or emergence through some sort of loop that's being explained in an action or emergence that people just talk about when things interact and something happens."
"Unknown","00;03;26;19","00;03;55;29","What I see this work with that duction of the work with abduction as being a way to make a much more tractable way for living things that start to make things happen these sorts of and not just everything emergence so I'm I see both these two as being big kind of black boxes that we can maybe shine some light on and that would help a lot of people."
"Unknown","00;03;56;04","00;04;24;01","So yeah, I'll pass it back to I pass it to you Daniel first. Well Majid go for it and just say anything you'd like to any context on the paper, the of I imagined I'm a philosopher of science based in Ankara Meadows Technical University, and I thank the organizer for this wonderful event and for the good and graceful discussion of the ideas and and themes of the paper."
"Unknown","00;04;24;06","00;04;54;23","I do not know if I can add anything that has not been discussed already in the past couple of sessions. So I think that this is well, there has been for the past few years. So I'm the second author of one of the papers active in France, Abduction and active in France and the other. All of the is a renewed Charles Sanders Paris a school hours so I mainly can take credit only for the parts that are active in France."
"Unknown","00;04;54;23","00;05;48;09","I'm not an expert in Paris of ideas or in semiotics, for that matter, but I also have been doubling from time to time in bio semiotics, and I was searching for a way to be able to grow semantics in nature, to be able to grow in semantics in natural law, which is very tricky because it seems that to the extent that we are engaging in natural processes, we can see mechanisms, we can see processes of meaning is something that emerges at some point, something that has not been there before in the nature itself, which which doesn't completely sound right because, well, it seems that everything has to become from nature at some stage, but it"
"Unknown","00;05;48;09","00;06;37;24","is not like a continuum. So I was thinking of finding a way for an action oriented way for being able to speak about meaning and representation. Well, well, the need in activist embodied approaches and collective science that philosophy of science are very well established. No, but to be able to grown semantic semiotics in action. We came to the conclusion that Active in France may provide a nice, very nice face that is well supported by what we know for in the sense of computational neuroscience and surgical biology, to be able to explain how some linguistic concepts, some semiotic concepts can be explicated in natural terms."
"Unknown","00;06;38;11","00;07;17;21","I don't know if any of that makes any sense to you, but it was what we were trying to do in this paper and a couple of other papers that we were composing to altering together. Excellent. Thanks for that context. So I got to ask you a question. So lots of times when we're talking about semantics, we tend to see them written down on pieces of paper as an example of like when you say semantics in nature, one of the questions that we've danced around but not sort of spoken to directly is sort of semantics as a nature."
"Unknown","00;07;17;21","00;07;59;13","Maybe semantics surrounding us and the abduction paper really helps us understand maybe the perspective that instead of us moving towards and saying semantics or generating semantics as being available to that information around us, what what's your sense after after sort of I don't know if you've embraced Pearce's philosophy, but after at least engaging with it, what is your sense of what semantics are as nature as opposed to sort of embedded in nature?"
"Unknown","00;07;59;13","00;08;35;26","Well, though, that's a very good question and also a difficult one. Well, look, so I actually didn't once I was trying to speak about was grounding semantic in nature saying that. So sometimes I also think of our environment, our trade information, our trade off with the environment in some mathematical term. But some other times I think that perhaps we are reading what we think about the world into the world."
"Unknown","00;08;35;26","00;09;01;25","Perhaps there are no meanings in the world itself. I think that if we want to be radically natural in civil war, we could. So the natural world doesn't contain semiotic in the sense that, for example, artificial language is human made, language is contains semiotics. That much is, I think, more or less obvious. I think that we can treat semi as akin to the nature, the same kind of semiotic that we can find in human made languages."
"Unknown","00;09;01;26","00;09;38;23","And so the nature, I think that that's obvious to on the other hand, the things that are made by human beings are in a sense natural because human beings are natural entities and they have this kind of natural capacities to be able to communicate with each other and with their environment. So there should be some sort of natural just come from building their it should be some sort of natural basis for that, which is basically I like to think of that in terms of human beings or community of human beings, action oriented interaction with one another and with nature."
"Unknown","00;09;38;23","00;10;09;06","So if you think of semantic in this sense, being thinking of being in semantics or being surging in semantic or enveloped in semantic in this sense. So I completely agree with you because I think that even though it is not precisely as well as stated semantics that we can find in an artificial language, there is some sort of tradeoff of information between human being, between organisms."
"Unknown","00;10;09;06","00;10;43;11","So organizing complex with another biotic self-organizing complex is simply that. And with their environment either individually or collectively. And I think that this provides a good natural basis for also understanding semiotics in the sense of the signs that the interpret the sign interprets its signs that's used in writing books or I don't know, different sorts of communication. The more advanced ways of communication."
"Unknown","00;10;43;11","00;11;27;09","Thank you, Stephen. Yeah, thanks, Majid. I was wondering when you're talking about these more advanced forms of communication or biological ways of having semantics, whether that's far more entropic, far more dispersive than what would happen when we think of it in our traditional literature of words and ways that we would have ontologies and computers. So these are kind of some of the is it a completely different process or is it like another flavor of what's your thoughts on that?"
"Unknown","00;11;27;26","00;12;04;04","Or I'm sorry, I wasn't quite clear about what I was trying to say. What I was trying to say is this look, well, speaking of the advanced forms of communication, I intend to refer to advanced form in comparison with the rudimentary natural form. So, for example, the way that we are speaking together right now or the way that Dan is just writing down the ideas on the screen and that sort of stuff, these are I think that these are advanced ways of doing some sort of semantic conduct in some sort of semantic enterprise because we can communicate."
"Unknown","00;12;04;04","00;12;47;25","And by speaking of that, in terms of advanced, I just wanted to say that it is more advanced that I don't know the very basic cases, for example, very basic cases that we can see in the natural world. So, for example, how the signaling processes in terms of of biological telescope biology, cellular biology, that sort of stuff. So I think that I'm seeing that in terms of some sort of theory of evolution, whole creatures or whole self-organizing systems is thought to call indicated by their and with their environments, even at the level, at the cellular level or at the level of population of cells or neurons or whatever."
"Unknown","00;12;47;25","00;13;19;27","So there are the rudimentary ways, but at the same time there are more advanced ways of communication, meaningful communication, such as what we do in human societies, whether in terms of individual or what we do in libraries, institutes and recently in terms of human artifact interact. So I suppose what I and I think that this story domain is sort of what, what persuaded us, what motivated those looking to active inference was that we wanted to find some sort of natural basis for that."
"Unknown","00;13;19;27","00;13;55;26","And you're completely right. Again, we were thinking of that in terms of in terms of the entropy of system keeping the entropy of this information, entropy of the system within the bones, so in full. So like everything else that has been constructed around the notion of active and friends of free energy principle, the core of this story is that in order to be able to maximize the chance of their survival, the motive, self-organizing systems have to be able to keep their entropy order soup from within the bones."
"Unknown","00;13;55;26","00;14;20;13","And in order to be able to do that, they have to be able to find ways to optimize their modes of communication. And I think that this provides a basis for a basis for the generation of semantics. So in order to be able to maximize the chance of survival, we need to be able to get to some level of competence."
"Unknown","00;14;20;13","00;14;44;24","And reaching that level of competence seems to be impossible. So I think that to the extent that this is stories action oriented to the extent that it tries to growing semantics in nature or semantics in nature, I think that this is completely faithful to the to the pragmatist, to the person origins. But then again, I'm not an expert in that field yet."
"Unknown","00;14;44;28","00;15;16;03","Thanks. Like what I heard there is that active inference helps us find patterns across systems by framing them within a common lens of keeping their entropy or their surprisingly bounded in engagement with their environment, which can include other entities like himself, or just a niche more generally, and maintaining that survivable bound homeostasis and all of the variance that we've discussed in other times."
"Unknown","00;15;16;24","00;15;44;21","It's going to have different features in cells. Bodies, computer programs like a computer program is a specifically constructed entity where one extra parentheses or period is going to lead to a halt. But this continuous embodied in an active nature of the biological engagement, the bias in meiosis, which is what is pointed to in the formalism that we saw in Hippo Alito and Venice Paper."
"Unknown","00;15;44;21","00;16;16;05","Again, the only formalism they brought in the paper, rather than siting out to worry about things, changing through time continuously. And so, yes, for sure, maintaining the bounds of computer programs in a digital and in a fragile setting is different than maintaining the bounds of survivability for like a cell or for a linguistic entity. And they are different, but they can even be said to be different unless we have some ways of juxtaposing and contrasting them."
"Unknown","00;16;17;14","00;16;52;25","So Stephen and then anyone else? Yeah, thanks. Thanks for that clarity. There is one thing that I think also this ties to and I think having this move from semiotics into like this broad kind of unifying theory of active imprints is really interesting and it speaks to some extent as well. To the when you say advanced communication, it speaks to what we often think of in complexity, work around complex and complicated."
"Unknown","00;16;52;25","00;17;32;26","So it's like organisms and life has this complex, adaptive, non-linear processing. And then there's these kind of simple to more and more complex weighted ways of engaging the need to do things, to have sort of systems of performative action using objects, using, in the case of words that can also be seen as objects. So there's this kind of parallel evolution between complicated is things being manipulated and simple processes of things being manipulated and complex."
"Unknown","00;17;32;26","00;18;19;27","So nonlinear adaptive processes of the it's all going on underneath all of that or is it very. Well, look, there are a bunch of technical notions such as complexity and I try to speak of this in terms of the basic ideas that they have in terms of philosophy of science. Because I'm basically a philosopher, philosopher of science. So when I speak of more advanced form and what I have in mind in terms of sophistication of ideas, I don't know whether it could be translated into the technical notion of complexity, but I'm saying that's like that."
"Unknown","00;18;20;13","00;18;52;17","So there is interaction between organism. So take the individual fish in the in a school of fish or take the monkeys in a hold of monkeys or or bear the flock or anything of that sort. And they have to be able to communicate. They have to be able to try to make sense, take to bear that out, trying to see to to perform and do it to seeing from the same human ship they are trying to."
"Unknown","00;18;52;17","00;19;18;04","So it seems that they are engaging in some sort of harmonious activity. In order to be able to do that, they have to be able to communicate this successful way that all together minimizes the overall entropy of the system. Information throughput of the system notes. By speaking of more advanced form, I'm not only thinking of the simpler forms of communication between birds and other kinds of bodies in both."
"Unknown","00;19;19;18","00;19;51;08","But in terms of the sophisticated cultural forms of communication, those views poetry. So I don't know, scientific theories which usually come, especially in the case of science, come with very sophisticated surgical and mathematical, sometimes formulation notation. And you're completely right. Again, they demand the right amount of manipulation because you need to always test the theories and and and confirm them or falsify them."
"Unknown","00;19;51;08","00;20;37;07","So this kind of engagements between human beings also mandates a great amount of manipulation because it is not just on the basis of transfer of pure information that takes place, but most of the time through manipulation of the environment, which is also engages artifacts other than other agents. And this is how we think of the sophistication or complexity of the situation by thinking of this in terms of the advanced forms of but cultural practices such as such as what we observe in mathematics, literature and science, which are still meaningful, which are which are still involving a great amount of semiotic enterprise, semantic enterprise."
"Unknown","00;20;37;07","00;21;11;23","But we need to be able to explicate them in simple natural forms of communication, like what we observe in the natural form and like what we hope to be able to be communicative in terms of minimization, of energy and minimization, and keeping the information entropy of the system within bounds. So it's a different thing to maintain the not that are worse, but merely different to maintain the survivability of a biofilm than a data center."
"Unknown","00;21;12;26","00;21;51;16","Yet we want to approach them in a first principles grounded, compatible, interoperable scientific lens. And so that is what perhaps brings in active inference. So Dean and then we'll continue strategy. Yes, yes. Just with regard to the last thing that then sue, there is another collaboration. I mean, there's the coauthored paper that is like me and to be published in, I think, the European Journal from Philosophy of Science."
"Unknown","00;21;51;17","00;22;41;05","And it is about the explicating methodologies of science, which also includes abduction and inference. The best explanation of other sort of is on the basis of active inferences. So you, you are completely right and in many ways this project to be able to explicate metallurgy of science at the individual and social level on the basis of these first principles, given all of the skepticism that there exist about trying to engage in first principles in life sciences, it sounds to be a very ambitious project, but it seems that where we are now, I think that I'm going I think that this is this is a project worth pursuing."
"Unknown","00;22;41;06","00;23;27;04","But if there is time, I will come back to that later. Excellent. Dean. Awesome. I got to got a question for you, because I think you can probably answer this better than I could. I'm still wrestling with this one. So if I'm if I'm a person who's trying to perform some kind of a situational analysis and try to determine what the functions and the purposes are and setting in which I exist, I can look at that in terms of semantic space, but what adduction I think introduces is the idea of semantic fine."
"Unknown","00;23;27;13","00;23;59;00","And I'm so glad that you sort of pointed to the fact that Daniel's typing stuff out right now. This is semantics time for him. He's actually generating some semantics even as we're talking. So I guess what I'm wondering is if we're going to if we're going to look through the lens of active indifference as the situational analysis lens, do we separate out what Daniel is doing when he's typing from the nature of what we're doing right now?"
"Unknown","00;23;59;00","00;24;29;15","Or do we see them as so sort of cool, cool compatibility? That's I don't know the answer to that. I kind of I'm leaning in the direction that they're they're kind of inseparable. They they orchestrate something that doesn't happen if we only have one or the other. What are your thoughts? Both those. So to tell the truth, I'm not well or or so when my phone was ringing and I lost focus for a moment."
"Unknown","00;24;29;15","00;24;57;15","But this and I do apologize for that if there is one of the reasons that I was hesitating to join. But though, could I do it again? I apologize to ask that, but could you elaborate a bit on the last part? I hear what I want. Yes. You get more familiar with the last part. Sure. Well, the semantic space stuff, I think is is really material."
"Unknown","00;24;57;15","00;25;27;15","Like you can see Daniel typing things out across that slop. But what I think Perse asks us to contemplate is the actual semantics time, the actual change or shift of what's actually happening in that moment. And so I was wondering if we are not just looking at active inference as the object of our attention, but we're actually inferring what is going to happen next."
"Unknown","00;25;27;16","00;25;58;17","Do we have to include the idea of what's happening not just semantically as as a product of what's typed out on the page, but as a process? And what does that what does that then imply in terms of what we can what we might be able to pick up quicker in terms of our our embedding in these different contexts that we otherwise wouldn't be able to pick up if we only had one or the other."
"Unknown","00;25;58;20","00;26;31;08","It kind of starts moving us towards this realism and realism debate, which I'm still not sure it should even be a debate, but that's me in my relativity shortly. What I heard there, both on unmute, is semantic spaces have been extremely characterized, not completely, but before active inference, long before people have done embeddings of sentences and meaning concepts in semantic spaces without a temporal aspect."
"Unknown","00;26;31;08","00;26;58;01","And so I heard a question about abduction as providing a framework for semantic or semiotic time, whether with the two stroke engine of generating and selecting hypotheses or the action perception loop or a few other ways, very well. Look very well. I think that that's a very good question. I put all in order to bloom one's own Trump as I took the paper that we wrote in the chat box."
"Unknown","00;26;58;01","00;27;24;02","And this is I think that this is precisely about this point because it is about selecting hypotheses, the process of selecting, selecting hypothesis. Look, and I do not know how to relate that directly to induction or abduction, but what I try to do is to say this, that at least in the so-called advanced forms of communication of abduction, that's a total of all."
"Unknown","00;27;24;16","00;27;52;23","What's important is not only what we are doing in the moment, but what's important to or estimation of what's going to happen later next. So and this is I think that it is very important in terms of choice. And there's first logic of not only logic of science, but also economics of science. When he says that we have to try to find a way to invest in theories, in hypotheses that have a chance to being a winner in a long time."
"Unknown","00;27;52;23","00;28;23;13","So in a way, time enters the process because we have to be able to have a long time view on how the abduction that we are going to construct the two fruitful results that's will be at the moment, but in future, possibly long future, especially if we are engaging in some sort of sophisticated, sophisticated process, such as scientific practice or such as pure hypothesis construction or hypothesis testing, time plays an important factor."
"Unknown","00;28;23;28","00;28;52;28","What's important about active inferences, especially the forms of active inferences that could be appealed to so many of us become active inference. Perhaps we didn't elaborate that much on the abduction and active interest paper, although we referred to that. But in the other paper I think that we have been referring to that quite a lot. The thing is that the kind of active influences that are useful in this context are active inferences that are taking place on the basis of temporal reach models."
"Unknown","00;28;52;28","00;29;27;07","What Chris and others mentioned as models that have some sort of temporal depth or temporal richness which basically allow the organism to have a perspective, have some insight not only on prediction of brain energy or minimization of free energy or minimization of information entropy, but also have some insight into the efficiency of its processes, its his its practices for minimizing energy in the long time."
"Unknown","00;29;27;07","00;29;55;19","So I think that it comes back to the issue of temporal depth and temporal richness, which is also is related in a very interesting way to the issues of consciousness as several other topic that I'm interested in. So this is the team. There are some low tech self-organizing systems that can engage in some sort of social activity and these self-organizing systems happen to also have this wonderful capacity to form abductions."
"Unknown","00;29;56;06","00;30;43;26","That's our info that that takes the temporal aspect into account at the same time, the same group of biotech self-organizing systems that are capable of making these kind of abductions inferences are also capable of having self food and consciousness and self consciousness and that sort of stuff. So in a very it comes together the ability to be able to form this kind of abduction that allows to choose the hypotheses, hypotheses that have a better chance to being good hypotheses in the long run, and the ability to have self or self-consciousness at the same time, the ability to form generative models that have some temporal depth or temporal richness."
"Unknown","00;30;43;26","00;31;13;25","So I think the temporal deficit is at the root of that all because it allows us to make policies and it allows us to have some strategies, some strategies that basically enable what we can think of in terms of scientific methodology, in terms of philosophy of science. That's an interesting if I could add a note there. Then past back to Dean and thinking about the similarities and the contrasts with different bio semiotic systems."
"Unknown","00;31;14;09","00;31;57;00","So a signaling protein or a signaling molecule might have a tremendously rich and contextual bio. So meiosis, like a hormone in a certain way, might do various different things relationship with the cellular context. So what I'm hearing with the, the more rudimentary forms or the non abductor forms of communication and the relationship with their temporal depth is that while there is a conditionality to the way that hormone is received and there's an instantaneous complexity or complicated ness, it doesn't necessarily have a temporal depth in the semiotics."
"Unknown","00;31;57;05","00;32;45;18","It might play a role in a temporal depth, like the hormone could play a role in developments. But the interpretation of that hormone is instantaneous, in contrast with linguistic communication. Even before we get to this level of like speaking to the distant future or invoking the distant past or different timelines and metacognitive awarenesses, there's a space of interpretation between the heard sound or the scene symbol itself and the way that it triggers internal cascades, which must involve temporal depth, like a word alone."
"Unknown","00;32;45;18","00;33;18;01","A phoneme alone is not conveying that same impact of meaning as the hormone binding. And so the increased cognitive complexity of like a linguistic entity opens up a space of interpreting action for the words that brings in the temporal depth and differences in acculturation and differences in what people have learned, whether they even know that word at all, whether they know about how it's being used by that person."
"Unknown","00;33;18;14","00;33;54;12","And so in the linguistic sub meiosis, we can see how it has analogy to other forms, yet also contains a space where also active inference can be used to start to disambiguate and to build models of deep exhaling. First of all, you can almost grab a boat to say, but I'm going to say it in different words. This question again around that objection paper."
"Unknown","00;33;55;02","00;34;20;25","I don't have the exact quote up there, but so paraphrasing. One of the things that in the paper that you point out is that Peirce understands that if you if you don't see the triadic, if you don't see the three kinds of logic as taken together the deductive, the inductive and the active, you're kind of missing what he was trying to alert us to."
"Unknown","00;34;21;12","00;34;44;22","My question is, so when we break it down further from that, if we reduce to inductive, inductive and objective, we don't leave it as a whole as it has that as the way of looking at all of the logics sort of working in concert is that is that looking down at logic as a tool, is it looking at it as instrumentalist?"
"Unknown","00;34;44;25","00;35;18;08","And if we if we take it down to that reductionist place, I know that if we leave it up that all three together working in concert, that's real. And that's the part that I very much agree with in your paper. But then my question was, you guys never really talked about this. If it's taken down to those more simple relative logics over time, are each one of those logics, then could we see them as actually being instrumental?"
"Unknown","00;35;18;08","00;35;50;02","Oh, well, I'm not sure that I can answer that question because I'm as I say, I'm not an expert on pairs, but I can see my own perspective. So what I was genuinely interested in was in engaging with peers ideas was the part that was able to abduction. So perhaps I was, I don't know, unless I think of this, I do not know why I was so interested in abduction."
"Unknown","00;35;50;02","00;36;19;11","But mostly the induction or induction. But perhaps because inference is the best explanation abductions are seen do seem to play an important role in philosophy of science, but of. Well, it seems that philosophers of science just take the induction of induction for granted that perhaps it is because well, I can defend that. I can defend that decision. I don't know whether we have to I had to at least spend more time to say induction induction."
"Unknown","00;36;19;11","00;36;55;28","But about this logics, or at least these kinds of inference inferences being instruments, I don't see why they couldn't be instruments. In a way, if I want to stick to the jargon of distributed cognition and embodiment and and activism the things that I'm pursuing, no, I think that we can think of them in terms of cultural tools, like many other kinds of cultural tools that we can use in order to pursue our intellectual course, whatever that intellectual quest is, they are to be pursued."
"Unknown","00;36;55;28","00;37;20;17","So I think that we can think of them as instruments. So the main question, I think because you also mentioned realism and anterior is a recursion, is that if we think of these things of instruments, would there be any room for being really suitable? This kind of approach is that related to the question of realism? What do you want to say?"
"Unknown","00;37;20;17","00;37;50;25","What do you want to say? Do you want do you want to relate that to the question of realism? Yeah, actually, actually, do I think as I said when I read you when I read the paper, I think the argument that says that if we if we look at Pearce's work as A.A. Nominalism non nominalism I believe when it's in its complexity state and the relationship between those logics it's the relationship between this logic says it's examined."
"Unknown","00;37;51;06","00;38;24;00","Yes, I very much agree. You can't describe that as anything other than realist. My question is, is that if we reduce below that, is that when that instrumental ism percolates? That's my question. All right. Well, look, so this is my perspective on realism in this context is this look, so we're speaking about semiotics and we're speaking of the semantic aspects of language and interpretation and that sort of thing."
"Unknown","00;38;24;00","00;38;49;23","So the question is that where this kind of interpretation, where this kind of semantic interaction with the world is coming from, I think that if if we can see that it is not something arbitrary, that this is something that is not developed or chosen on the basis of convention that's only conventions. The conventions that are being go, I don't know, one term."
"Unknown","00;38;49;23","00;39;33;14","And the second element is if there is some objective element on that in that it is not it is not instrumental, then it will provide some basis for reality. And there are semiotic and semantic aspects seen. For example, constructing scientific hypotheses or theories or scientific practice and that sort of approach. I think that to the extent that we are able to grow in this semantic and semiotic aspects in nature, to the extent that we can provide some sort of down to earth natural explanation for the emergence of this semantic and semiotic element, we could defend some of realism."
"Unknown","00;39;33;18","00;40;09;16","So then again, you may ask What sort of realism is that? And I can't say that this is the sort of realism that that is informed by all best scientific theories. So it's in some sort of radically natural take on realism that I think would be kind of compatible with pragmatic is then pursuing ideas. So I think that the realist take comes from the fact that we try to grow in semiotics in semantic, the logic of abduction, induction deduction, all of that."
"Unknown","00;40;09;24","00;40;47;08","We try to find natural processes that enable those kind of inferences. And to the extent that we can find natural processes that are explicated in terms of so best scientific theory, there remains some for defending a version of realism that Willard Van Orman quite used to call the robust realism. It is robust in the sense that it depends it instead of trying to latch onto mind independent science, independent realities into the objective of this kind of realism draws its force from all the scientific theories."
"Unknown","00;40;48;04","00;41;16;14","And I think that it is real. It is real. It's in the sense that we can provide a natural. It's the story we can flesh of some natural that's natural the story, some that some say scientific is stories of these psycho logical growing the mechanisms that enable this kind of inferences. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, Steven. And then I'll add a note."
"Unknown","00;41;16;14","00;41;50;14","Thank you. When you mention so you mentioned the scientific process and almost the the deductions, the inductions that can occur with a model, a scientific model that's being created. So which is slightly different to say the the what's real for me at the scale at which I can perceive as a human and see things, my model might be able to see things slightly beyond what my sense sensorium can perceive."
"Unknown","00;41;50;14","00;42;33;29","In my experience, the ecosystem I like to use the term experience of ecosystem of being alive. So when that's the case, is it almost that these models are given some sort of agency, some sort of sentience, that what's real for the model in a way, or a very little of both, but that's a very good question. In order to try my best to an answer to that, I may need to drift away a bit from the scientific context and engage in some sort of philosophical discussions that might be a bit boring for for the audience."
"Unknown","00;42;34;00","00;43;13;19","I'm not sure about that. But for us to try, try or, you know, giving some sort of agency to model, it is an interesting question. It occurs in the as it happens, I think it's worth taking seriously, but it might not be directly related to. So in order to be able to defend some sort of model, in order to to to advocate some sort of model based version of realities, then you do not necessarily need to give agency to models."
"Unknown","00;43;13;19","00;43;43;01","And because in order to be really, you, the thing is this is the nature of the structure of scientific theories is so complicated that we cannot defend realism on the basis of some some sort of perceptual or sense perception evidence. So the the evidence for scientific theories, if you think of this in terms of model based science, doesn't come in terms of sense perception because the construction of scientific theories is much more complicated than that."
"Unknown","00;43;43;01","00;44;17;23","There are different kind of so there are different kinds of experimental and manipulation, told to call distortion, idealization, you name it. So when we speak of models, there are different kind of things that make it very hard to to think of model based representation as some sort of direct relation. So we cannot defend realism, both models in terms of relating, says perception or says data or something directly directly to the models of."
"Unknown","00;44;18;00","00;44;38;10","There are other kinds of virtues that we may want to depend on. And most of the time, philosophers of science do not agree on a specific set of virtues that could be. And they usually speak of frustrations, of simplicity, fruitfulness, parsimony, that sort of a stuff of efficiency. But usually they do not agree on a specific set of set of virtues."
"Unknown","00;44;38;10","00;45;17;17","But one thing that they are agreeable to is that models do not receive confirmation on the basis of their feats with sense experiences, because it seems that our modern science model think of this in terms of quantum mechanics things not only that, but different sorts of sizes is becoming so totally complicated or scientific models are becoming so idealized and towards entities that featuring these models are sometimes so sophisticated that it would be futile to try to find some sort of perceptual or sensory evidence for that."
"Unknown","00;45;18;00","00;46;15;26","Right? So well, and again, when we speak of abduction and when we speak of inference in this explanation, I still think that the interest is something that active inference could eventually or could at some point need to at least grow in some methodology of model selection that allow us to on the same basis, on more or less on the same basis, the source this person speaks of logic of science or economics of science can lead to some sorts of methodology of science that alone that that could allow us to select scientifically fruitful models, models that deserve to be given a chance by realists as teams that are providing a more or less reliable image of"
"Unknown","00;46;15;26","00;46;59;07","the universe without depending directly on sense experiences. Thanks. There's there's a lot there. One of the most key pieces of, I think the juxtaposition of these papers and how we're seeing the discussion around science and realism and inculturation in progress in 2022 is that and to connect this also to this area of the semantics and semantic time which abduction requires, it's at least to physic."
"Unknown","00;46;59;16","00;47;29;07","So it has to both be happening in the same instant, in the same unit. So the question of realism and especially on specific constructs within the broader apparatus of free energy principle like focusing on the blanket construct mark I'll blanket first and blanket, etc. It's often been approached in terms of a question of composition, reality of space, as you put it, like mind independent."
"Unknown","00;47;29;07","00;47;54;05","Does this exist physically? What do you mean by the table exist physically? I mean, it's there when I'm not looking or if I don't believe it's there. It could still hit me in the mind. Independent situation. First off, there's a massive challenge in re minding that system, the whole hard problem of consciousness or even just simply hard problem of biochar condition or symbiosis."
"Unknown","00;47;54;20","00;48;43;09","And so in that setting, it's very defensible to take a instrumental perspective on the meaning of semantic spaces. When we turn from a composition polity of mind, independent physical space into a composition ality of meaning as enacted in the pragmatic sense, what's real is action. Then the commitment to mind independence being lifted. We have actually a multi perspective cognitive scenario that naturally embodies questions of semiotics because meaning as enacted is model dependent."
"Unknown","00;48;44;08","00;49;24;13","And so I'm sure there's a lot of like loose threads or other ways to go. But again, it's a large turn for me to see the discussion evolve from being about mind, independent, physical interpretations as being the crux of realism and the pragmatic shift, as opposed to like the materialist or the reductionist stance and the pragmatic shift reintroduces mind or really just removes the kind of filter or the dam and just lets mind rush back in."
"Unknown","00;49;24;13","00;50;03;19","So there's really a lot there. And then you connect that all the way to active inference grounding methodologies of model selection and I think in that domain inherits greatly on a huge amount of statistics and machine learning work on policy selection for example, like using a free energy functional and minimizing it to scan and evaluate and make a decision upon a space of of affordances and policies is what has been happening in control theory, cybernetics and so on."
"Unknown","00;50;04;04","00;50;31;11","Even down to the evidence, lower bounds and the forms of the free energy functions that are used are broadly related to exactly model selection processes. So just like if we were doing a linear regression, we might want to fit the least squares error. And if we were doing a Bayesian model selection, we might want to use like a base factor or a BBC or AIC criterion."
"Unknown","00;50;31;11","00;51;13;24","Here we're in the space of mind based cognitive entities, active particles, and so active inference provides a process theory that is able to make all of that come together and make sense. And then this paper connected it to the qualitative, though rigorous, in structured framework of abduction and kind of fit like abduction into the ignition instead of the inductive deductive, which can be limiting in certain contexts."
"Unknown","00;51;15;01","00;51;58;09","Stephen Just, just wanted to pick up back on when you mentioned about model selection. Um, so that's interesting in the sense that there's this policy selection in active inference. Okay, what policy I'm going to take on my action. I suppose you can look at what regime of attention will I use and will capitulate my internal model and I think a lot of times and attention this is often thought about in active inference, but really the model selection may well be the external artifacts or the like."
"Unknown","00;51;58;17","00;52;29;16","Um, like, like Mujib was talking about the scientific model is, is different to say the model selection that's happening in terms of maybe types of generative models that we might think of in the brain and can have its own, you know, it can exist. Someone could write a paper like a piece and you know, it wasn't published and people pick it up 50 years later and it's recapitulated into a system of of meaning making."
"Unknown","00;52;30;19","00;53;02;12","So I think this is the ways that models get selected and then how they can be used and maybe couched in a system I think is really interesting. And maybe that system is also we've talked about this before and it is when that system doesn't need to be alive anymore to function like can there be a dead system, a computer system that can then or how much of it becomes not dependent on a living?"
"Unknown","00;53;02;22","00;53;33;14","So that's just just one point that I think comes back to that question of, you know, where is it ultimately grounded. Thank you, Steven. Yes, Majid. I think that, unfortunately, I have to sort to leave. And I do not want to open the can of worms before doing that. But I want to briefly speak about what the Steven mentioned."
"Unknown","00;53;33;14","00;54;06;15","Right. The world, for example. And I want to stay with the example that you provided. For example, the person being dead centers first being dead, but five years of being picked up. But then I was starting to think of scientific practice in terms of active inference. In a book that I wrote in 2019, people associate to make very significant criticism and meaningful that active influence in interior of individual brains."
"Unknown","00;54;06;15","00;54;41;02","But scientific practice is not an individual activity. It is not something that science is not taking place in the brain of individual, individual people. It is some sort of social activity that is distributed in in in scientific groups and scientific communities. So and then it gets more deeply engaged with this literature on distributed scientific cognition in terms in terms of works of grown of gear and some other people."
"Unknown","00;54;41;02","00;55;06;29","And I find it very interesting. So a lot of the model selection, scientific model ethics and some sort of advanced form of cognition seen as form of cognition is growing that I still think that it's grounded in active inference, but it doesn't need to take place at the level of individual scientists. It could be distributed to the community of scientists."
"Unknown","00;55;06;29","00;55;37;11","And then the issue of minimization, of entropy could be understood in terms of minimization, of collective entropy, of scientists, or even minimization of the collective entropy of the coupled community of scientists and their environment. I think that it leads to some sort of revolutionary understanding of the nature of scientific theory, because we usually think of scientific theories as a class of propositions or set of models, heritage or said theoretic models in terms of mathematics."
"Unknown","00;55;37;23","00;56;06;01","But if we broaden the scope so we to think of theories as pieces of information, as pieces, pieces of knowledge that are dispersed, then distributed in scientific community or things that are that emerged through the interaction between the scientific community or scientific group, the scientific group and their environment. I think it's it may lead to very interesting, very interesting perspective on the nature of scientific theories as well."
"Unknown","00;56;06;06","00;56;33;22","So in a way, I was hijacking this discussion of active inference because I was too, because being being trained and bred as a philosopher of science, I made interesting in some internal issues in philosophy of science. And then I speak of scientific realism. I think of that interesting. You call to classical terms in philosophy of science, being realist about the target system of theories and scientific models."
"Unknown","00;56;34;08","00;57;04;07","But I think that still leaves ample room for also being really active in France itself, both for different reasons and for reasons that are much more sophisticated and complicated. The could be could be occupied directly with relation to mind, independently ability of active inferences or or whether there are such things as first principles in mind independence more. So I think that of course there are no such things as first principle of mathematical principles."
"Unknown","00;57;04;07","00;57;28;07","Even if you open up brain and nervous system, you can find first principle mathematical, first principle, you will find different kinds of tissues and the kinds of other kinds of things. But I think that this to concern about realism, about active inference I've been there your principle and my own concern about scientific realism, about targets of scientific theories that could be selected on the basis of activity."
"Unknown","00;57;28;08","00;57;52;12","Interest could be related together at some point you have to apologize. This is a joy to participate in this discussion. And I have to apologize for for being pushed to leave abruptly. It's excellent, Majid. We appreciate it. And the three is yours when the time is right. Thank you very much. It was very nice to meet all of you."
"Unknown","00;57;52;22","00;58;17;18","I'm going to leave you to take care. Wow. Okay. Well, take a deep breath, then. We'll continue. Or maybe you don't even need to breathe. Then go for it. Well, I just love the fact that the term hijacking was introduced not by me, because one of my biggest fears around this talk to us was hijacking something. And I think I."
"Unknown","00;58;18;06","00;58;46;18","I think I understand what he means by that, because it actually feels that way. If you if you look at what we were just talking about, which is active inference could ground a methodology of model selection. Let's just assume for a second objectively that it does. It can and it does. Well, what would that mean? Well, what that would mean is it's literally changing the directionality of what we typically perceive."
"Unknown","00;58;46;18","00;59;32;27","And as you pointed out, we can't let our perceptions conflate what we are perceiving with what whatever reality is. And I think we've all agreed that that's that's dangerous thing to do. However, in in the spirit of what what what could act as an inference ground in terms of methodology and then in terms of model selection, my my question is typically typically in the outside world, as we're using scientific principles, we start with an idea, a hypothesis, a process, and we turn that into a product, some kind of a materialization."
"Unknown","00;59;33;00","01;00;12;28","Steven and I, we're actually chatting about before we came on the live stream today. That's what we see. That's what we sometimes label the reality, what act inference as act of inferring suggests is the mark of it stays in the middle between the generative model and the generative process. However, if we were to actually contemplate that active inference could ground a methodology and does we would actually say that the generative model is the product or is the materialization."
"Unknown","01;00;13;12","01;00;47;08","And as we pass through the Markoff blanket, we actually move to two different versions of of process. One is relativity, the other is relationship. And together that forms a new absolute test. So that is literally the emergence. And that's kind of where I started in this. I haven't sort of been not explicit in my mind, excited out there to have a whole bunch of people take a bite out of it."
"Unknown","01;00;47;11","01;01;35;07","But if if we, I think, are courageous enough and take the risk and we look at that differently than how we traditionally looked at it, that process leads to product. Another way of describing that is product and process, but we actually look at it as process in product, meaning we start with whatever our hard evidence is as a generative, as a product, and then from that we gain insights and intangibles and things that we call structure because understand now relationships and the relativity and those new absolute isms, that would be the condition under which active inference actually ground model selection."
"Unknown","01;01;35;19","01;02;08;00","What do you guys think about that? It's a nice angle. I'd like to move to the images that you've prepared and see where that comes back. So let's return to the initial juxtaposition slide that we looked at in the DOT zero. Yeah, with iceberg. Okay. So again, I'll put our our video chat as the tip of the iceberg."
"Unknown","01;02;08;00","01;02;47;27","We raised many points of contact between these two papers and then you've provided a graphical abstract. We could say that we're going to go through now and then from that graphical abstract, we're going to enter into one or more of these comparisons and see how they are structured in relationship with the general abstract, which we'll see now. So here we are what is happening on this slide."
"Unknown","01;02;47;27","01;03;15;07","Okay. So in as recently had there in the YouTube clip where she was talking, I think the topic of the conversation was the free energy principle and the edge of chaos. And one of the quotes that I pulled was she made a statement making this bridge logically sound, because what she was looking at was the sum of the sum of the debate."
"Unknown","01;03;15;07","01;03;44;21","This was going on between realism, naturalism and of course, in order to be able to talk about those things. She spent a lot of time looking at free energy principle and how that works. And then she she did a really brilliant job of sort of trying to make a case for why the debate was taking place, why she and some of the authors that she works with have taken the position that they've taken."
"Unknown","01;03;44;21","01;04;17;17","What I think that us bringing to topics like that that's been focused on in action and social cognition and abduction, if we bring those things together proximally, which is what we've done in this Livestream series, we could actually show how potentially you can move from a place that says, Well, if I'm all about the realism, then I can't be anti realist and vice versa."
"Unknown","01;04;18;27","01;05;04;21","I think what if you're in a position where you're trying to help people understand not what they see outside of themselves as a product going through an assembly line, like somebody who's learning, and then they come out the other end and they're now all assembled because they've gone through a process. If you actually start out as seeing this human living system as a product that is made up of things that are already present, priors and posteriors and all of these actions that it can take as an agent and you actually move from the left of that bottom, bottom left corner diagram to the right."
"Unknown","01;05;05;08","01;05;34;15","You can actually use the inaction in the objections and the realism and the realism as placeholders within a markoff blanket setting. And as you move through time and is passing through time as in depth, the field of some of those memory traces that you are pushing through your working memory and pulling out from your long term memory, as well as literally the river of time flowing."
"Unknown","01;05;34;27","01;06;06;19","You could move from an idea of this is the this is sort of the platform, product or stability, the grounding from which I start. And as I become more and more familiar with what I'm analyzing, situation finally, I can actually pick up the relationships, the entanglements and the realm, the realm, the role, sorry, relationships as relativity and the relationships as entanglements."
"Unknown","01;06;07;10","01;06;41;06","And so that is acting as an act of infer as opposed to looking at and through active inference lens. So that's what I was trying to pull together here, just as it says in the middle of this slide, as active inverse as prediction produces across all processes, not just subject matter, one of them could be active inference as a tool or as a non tool when is active."
"Unknown","01;06;41;06","01;07;06;03","And then this was we've already talked about the wetness of semiotics. When is active inference both a partition and a frame and when is it also a filter? So looking back through time and then pulling from the memorial and projecting out into the future, how do we how do we keep the complexity? How do we keep the triad?"
"Unknown","01;07;06;23","01;07;35;18","How do we avoid the trap of reducing down, but then not being able to build back up to the complexity scale where the reality actually exists? Because I think if you if you if you cross a certain threshold and you get to the operations level, of course it's got to be tools. Of course it's got to be instrumental ism, but then it's got to come back to and I think Jen Daniel, you mentioned this earlier, they've got to come back to."
"Unknown","01;07;35;23","01;08;16;18","So what about that table that I bumped into? Is that not real? And so I think it's the ability to sort of go below the threshold and then resurface back above. It's being able to understand and what the actual order boundaries are and what the rows and columns and their ability to differentiate are. And I think if we wanted to, as I said, I don't want to hijack, but if we wanted to, we could show how both the in action and the logic application requires this, or at a minimum at least gives us the complexity state from which active inference which was."
"Unknown","01;08;16;26","01;08;56;29","It's kind of the one thread that holds all of this together, retains that sense of, okay, it's both A.L. and Real at the same time. Thank you, Dean. Stephen, First I yeah. Deep breath. So yeah, no, it's, it's really there's a lot here and this is really powerful. And I think I think the idea moving through these ways of interpreting and real really so that moving through or moving through the in action abduction, I think that's helpful."
"Unknown","01;08;58;00","01;09;32;18","And the idea of how that passing through happens or we're trying to pass almost the trough a bit between the two. And there's this idea that there's maybe a couple of roads. We traditionally have this high road low, but it can be icy is also the way that we structure that understanding of abduction, of an action of realism is shown up our idioms."
"Unknown","01;09;32;18","01;09;56;26","It shows up in the way we structure our language. So to what extent, if we're passing through the middle here, right through the middle and I'm saying is and if I was to go in on my left, there's a road on my right, there's a road and the road that's left to be explored. But the road that's forever given and within the left field is the inaction, the abduction."
"Unknown","01;09;57;06","01;10;47;12","And what's right is my anti real wheel. I mean, it's either anti whether it's real, right? That's right. As they say in North America. So I think there's an there's this way that we're sort of trying to engage with these ideas as practitioners and researches and kind of interdisciplinary sort of connectors, which starts to become itself structured. So I think this is this diagram is quite helpful to, to start to tease out some of that in, in again, maybe a kind of in an active way."
"Unknown","01;10;47;12","01;11;36;17","Thanks. I'll make a few comments and then let's jump into the comparisons and see how this image is applied. So the epistemic foraging, the journey, the learning journey, all of these have a temporality. And so I just wanted to quickly note that that connects very much to our discussion on semantic space and semantic time. Okay? If there's a space to be semantically exploring, but we're taking a path in it then first off, Dalton and Maxwell at all path formulation of active inference is a natural fit and we need to consider the when this and as we've talked about when there's clock time with Kronos and then there's the timeliness with kairos and so that epistemic"
"Unknown","01;11;36;17","01;12;06;13","journey we don't need to deny or even take a realism or not stance on the chronology. We do need to take a reality of that journey in the abductor of semiotic space with time. Then, Steven, you brought in this road and path metaphor. And so one thought there was these are like signposts, like they're labeling the quadrant, but we kind of have a cultural norm."
"Unknown","01;12;06;13","01;12;34;06","Actually, that quadrant is all labeled. It's not only labeled underneath the word. And so when we have a signpost and say we're going along this road, that doesn't mean you just gravitate and collide with the signpost. In fact, we're always like moving between and among signposts. And then I just thought of someone saying, like, I'm in the city, I'm as close as you can be to the one pen on Google Maps or something like that."
"Unknown","01;12;34;22","01;13;11;08","But actually these labels have a diffusive aspect to them. So outside of important and clarifying scholarly debates, where we are like with both feet on one label and trying to knock others off their perch with both on their label, which we looked at in the sort of survivor context previously, the people in the audience and in the crowd and the kokiri leaders that the Hip Alito and Venice Paper really artfully focuses attention on."
"Unknown","01;13;12;12","01;13;39;22","Like, what about the fact social cognition is distributed in an active and in culture? What about that? They're in that trough between the signposts. So those are a few aspects. And then one last one was like, Gene, you mentioned relation as relativity and relation as entanglement. And it makes me think about as as this helps us see aspects of edges can mean different things."
"Unknown","01;13;40;10","01;14;09;26","We look at a lot of base graph representations where edges have a certain interpretation in a statistical framework, but even then with effective, functional and anatomic connectivity, we've also talked about different kinds of edges and. Now here we're in the space time of some meiosis and there are edges and some of those edges reflect, relationships among nodes and others are entanglements."
"Unknown","01;14;10;11","01;14;45;12","So the ankle bone and the kneebone might be like entangled in the physical real world. Whether we know about that link or not, there's something to it that's real in the sense that Magid is using realism. And then there's also a relationship with a creative enough forager among everything, because you can say the relationship between the ankle and the field of astronomy is they will start with a letter A or you could do any other number or this is just not that that's the simplest relationship is they're not the same thing or they both are related to the same thing."
"Unknown","01;14;46;09","01;15;32;25","It's general. It's not always a useful statement to make. Well, forks are not spoons, okay? But utility is just one of the virtues or the criteria by which we might evaluate a certain epistemic path and are harshness on grading or evaluating epistemic paths doesn't always have to be extreme, and that doesn't have to be one rubric either. So there's so many connections in that space, pragmatism and the productivity and the social setting where all productivity is ultimately embodied, brings pieces in that are hopefully of epistemic and pragmatic value."
"Unknown","01;15;32;25","01;16;19;08","Let's go to the comparisons, or do you want to stay here? Do you know, I just I just want to point something. In order for the comparisons to make sense, I have to kind of look for contact. So these arrows I want to just quickly the inner directionality results from limits or constraints, things we've used, expressions upper and lower bounds, and by directionality result from parallel processing, things like arbitrary parameter ization which blue and I and you've talked about lot last week the arbitrariness of that then the question becomes does a bridge right as an idea remain a bridge, as a materialization, as entanglements, things like the relatives part that Carl talks about, the parents"
"Unknown","01;16;19;08","01;16;46;19","and the children and and we've been talking about this a lot and entanglements, meaning the relationship of same and different. So how does that play out? Typically from an academic way of producing that is to start with? Well, we've got to come up with a process. We've got to come up with a methodology to derive a product. What I'm suggesting active inference does is it starts with a whole bunch of products."
"Unknown","01;16;46;19","01;17;12;22","It's like what it is. And and Thomas talked about in their paper, you could construct that social space. You start with a product and then you learn how to translate and interpret one, one another. Quick thing, if you're on the other side of this paper, it says a a blanket as a scale free statistical tool. Yes, yes, yes, it is."
"Unknown","01;17;13;07","01;17;43;11","And in a midget and and at his paper in order to state stay stay in a non-equilibrium city, stay within it with its environment, an organism must regulate its internal entropy. The mark, a blanket of a node consists its parents, children and co-parents. That's all true. So it depends on whether you start with the product and move to the process, or whether you start with the process and move to the product."
"Unknown","01;17;43;22","01;18;18;29","And that's where things really open up and optionality really becomes our thing with active inference, or at least that's what I'm trying to argue also in that I saw Bridge not as just the thing that you drive on, but a bridge is a stance. It's a position like a back bend and it's a game. And in that interpretive space is the difference between the signaling molecule at the cellular level and human linguistic communication."
"Unknown","01;18;19;06","01;18;55;26","So not to return only to that, but in that space we can respect whatever led that generative model of in us to say that and mean that and it's always going to be a yes and with our interpretation and to the extent that there are anti virtues of model comparison, speaking for another cognitive entity could be something like that because you're never going to escape the fact that it's your framing still of their intentionality."
"Unknown","01;18;55;26","01;19;24;06","So how are we going to take that as a starting point rather than shut the door on discussion because of that being a real feature of social discourse? Stephen Yeah, and this so further to that product process and how that fits and the potential bridge is that gives then can I just ask you, you saying as well, this, this links to the idea of the model in the game."
"Unknown","01;19;24;06","01;19;54;05","We're coming back to the idea of modeling rather than the model. So with active inference, you know, you're you're not you're not well in in the Trojan horse with a model going to take out you know, you we're bringing in a modeling process where the product can be retro interpreted, right? So reverse engineered or somehow. So then maybe there's something in that we don't."
"Unknown","01;19;54;14","01;20;16;20","Yeah. That makes sense to what you know to well so again it's easier to put down a critical path because people are familiar with that right like this is the thing is these are the steps check these boxes and this will be your result. All this is doing is showing the inversion of that and what the possibility is."
"Unknown","01;20;17;08","01;20;48;18","So I'm agreeing with you, Stephen. How do we bring both into people's front of mind attentional space? Because I think it's both that are dancing with one another as we are figuring something out if we want to follow. That's that's a that that doesn't require both. But if we want to forage or stigma stigma surgically awry, we're at a place we don't know other than as an abstraction."
"Unknown","01;20;50;07","01;21;13;24","Even the I don't want. Daniel, you're the expert at this, but I don't know the abstraction is for an and that that has faith that whatever they are doing in terms of following that trail is what they were put on this good earth to do. The puns will come, but I might even say that that's how to answer."
"Unknown","01;21;14;12","01;21;39;18","Okay, let's go to the first comparison. Okay. Okay. We're talking about. Yeah, go for it. Just describe this. Does this remove the limits? If you notice all four of the red lines on the outside of the previous diagram have been removed because this was the inactive social cognition paper. And essentially what this does is divide up that space."
"Unknown","01;21;40;05","01;22;12;17","It takes the generative model and allows it to now be categorized if that's what you want to do. If you want to move from the triadic of of deductive and and inductive, this is how you actually create those different subcategories within the the larger picture. So there's a quote from their paper from Nunez and Thomas paper it's possible understand active infancy to raise a realist view that the properties of the model constructed by applying active tools should be also be expected to exist."
"Unknown","01;22;13;14","01;22;43;29","Sorry as an ontologically property in the scientific phenomenon, we trying to explain a non realist view that the model used is simply an instrumental tool once applied to some activity allows the scientists to draw interpretations of explanations and then they go on to talk about why they use dynamical systems theory. So we already talked today about so what happens when you cross a threshold does that is that when complexity arises versus when you're below the threshold and that's when something different than complexity exists."
"Unknown","01;22;44;05","01;23;19;16","And so my my argument would be, yes, you can have something that's complexity and then you can have something that's complicated and tool and tools and instruments are still complicated. Don't get me wrong, there's a huge technical investment that you have to make in terms of being able to make and function. But the note that I wanted to put down here was is causal order being explicated not as some generality as in I'm being imaginal now on the abstract one, but rather as a specific place in time the relational causality patterns from which context and longevity."
"Unknown","01;23;19;21","01;23;47;29","And I love machines without any prompting. Talking about temporal depth, we started down that path to life for you to go that can be gapped, can actually be addressed, is placed in that in that distribution, right. Because we respect both difference and distance within the collective as a new scale, as relational, because now actively inferring which includes selection from within in a distribution."
"Unknown","01;23;48;04","01;24;19;10","The counterfactual which if this is this goes right back to what it said about we could use it as a grounding for the model selection is not only able to function as a tool, but of selection by the selector process processing the action taker with the real realm by the free energy principle. So we must first deconstruct meaning if there's anything within this that needs categorization and separation, we can do that in order to decode, construct or choose."
"Unknown","01;24;19;29","01;24;53;19","Choose how to move from a product to. This is entailing that or this is entangled with that. All we have to do is see it without the bounds or the horizons. Same image. One less thing. Let me contrast that with two slightly more technical notes. The first is Figure 9.1 in the March 2022 active inference textbook. This is what's described as the meta Bayesian perspective."
"Unknown","01;24;54;03","01;25;29;27","And so here the outer shell is the experimenter and the experimental context that they're providing in terms of stimuli and then the behavior that they're observing of the entity in system and, they are making a cognitive model of an entity. So this is cognitive modeling as a process. That's one aspect and it can be an active inference process from the experimenter without falling into the all minds or scientist fallacy that Yellow Bromberg as adequately sketched for us even in 2016."
"Unknown","01;25;30;20","01;26;06;01","But we can still see an active inference framing of the outer experimental loop and use compatible frameworks for modeling the inner cognitive loop. And then one other note there with this section of what you wrote is when we're using the active block for package, which is implementing active inference in CAD, CAD, a complex systems modeling framework, CAD CAD enables parameter sweeps, so you can have a parameter inside your simulation point one."
"Unknown","01;26;06;01","01;26;54;13","And then you could test and run a bunch of simulations concurrently or in series. Like what if it were point one, point two, .3.4? We've also thought towards using active inference exactly in this meta Bayesian way, because the parameter sweep space can become vast if you have hundreds of parameters, the sweeping across one dimensional spaces is massive. The space is large, which actually motivates an imperative for searches, and that brings timeliness back into the picture through the scientific modeling process in finite lives, finite resources and so on, where we're using inference and finding optimally informative experiments of parameters to test about the inner system."
"Unknown","01;26;54;13","01;27;22;26","And so this is like a case where in the visual, graphical analytical framing shown here in Figure nine one or in the computation panel implementation with active block fronts in both of those technical settings, mathematical and computational. And then this setting, whatever it is that's on this slide, all of those are showing it's not even just like left eye open, right eye open."
"Unknown","01;27;23;14","01;27;59;13","This is we're not just switching the monocle from one eye to another. It's actually able to be like wrapping and gripping itself in this way. Stephen, thanks. If you go back to that previous slide, the ties to this from the textbook and then if you still got it there, the text image. Yeah. And the this is where it says subjective model."
"Unknown","01;27;59;18","01;28;41;18","I would imagine that self could be called you might be thought of as an instrument of sorts or a modeling process. But there is this, there's a question about how this can be interpreted. And this is is is used for maybe this is a sort of a bridge is even within this. It's like, well, subjectivity is an interesting term where it's actually now being modeled out, whereas the objective way is it, where where would that then be in terms of, you know, is it a case of really getting a feel for these parameters as they sweep?"
"Unknown","01;28;41;23","01;29;04;19","You find the sweet spot, you find that scale friendliness that starts to emerge could be enough I mean, that could be what a lot of organisms are doing as well, although it's refined, obviously, through evolution. But, you know, as you sweep is what pragmatically you where you need to be as opposed to being real values that have been aimed for."
"Unknown","01;29;06;05","01;29;26;17","So you get into this interesting loop, I think that theme was showing there between the realism integrators and I mean there might even be times to break realism to get out of that hard look and say this is really what's going on now. It's a sweep to find a scale friendliness. It's you know theme is going to say something that a passer over."
"Unknown","01;29;26;17","01;29;55;12","Well no no no I just love this because without really sort of prompting that that that diagram that I put up I don't know when when Carl built that diagram, I know when I built mine and then and ported it over to this set of slides, it was many, many years ago. And the thing that I always to people who I shared it with and I tried to unpack it and explain it, was, I want you to manipulate it."
"Unknown","01;29;55;14","01;30;37;12","Well, the fantastic thing is many, many times in his capacity as a host and moderator of these livestreams, he takes information and he manipulates it, which is exactly what I had participants in the programing that I was doing actually do. Because if it's left as the representation and the person isn't allowed to move things around and actually play with it, then they have to take they are they I'm imposing on them or the person reading Carl's books and Carl's representation that that process to product like there's a product now in front of you that's already been established and now you're interpreting that."
"Unknown","01;30;37;12","01;31;05;18","But every time you manipulate it, you actually start by creating your own product first and then through the manipulation, discover the relationship and the relativity. So one of the things, whether it's Carl's representation or my much cruder one, it's still when when the person picks it up and literally sweeps through it. Stephen as you were describing it, that's when the inversion actually takes place."
"Unknown","01;31;05;18","01;31;38;26","If you leave it static, if you leave it as a bridge and then you don't get a chance to move it around and manipulate it and represent it through your own inaction. That's when that's where we tend to get I mean, some of us are super, right? I'm not one of those people. That's why I had to give people like me the opportunity to say, don't just leave it on the page, play with it, do something with it, enact it into your own set of comprehension as well."
"Unknown","01;31;39;04","01;32;09;00","So here's a little evocative image meme, but let's complete the comparison we discussed how we had the open edge quadrant model here and some quotes from the inactive dynamic paper. Now we're going to go to the next slide where the bounding of the red is on the outside of the visual and we're taking quotes from the objective paper."
"Unknown","01;32;09;00","01;32;32;21","So what quotes did you highlight from the paper and what does the change in the visualization represent? Okay, the first thing they see is that the rows in the columns have disappeared and all we've done is make sure that there's those those edges on the outside. So just to confirm that. So remember, this is just comparison. One, there were six comparisons between these two papers that I pulled."
"Unknown","01;32;33;06","01;33;18;15","So I want to make that clear too. But on this first comparison, just to show what the differences between an edge less and an edge constraint, this is especially the case is a quote now from somebody and with paper, this is especially the case if we assume that the development of mark up blankets by Kristen now except first in blankets unlike their original characterization works by Julia Pearl on probabilistic causal networks admit of a realist interpretation of the relationship between the organism and the environment while the role so it's variability retain the role of the concepts of the Markoff blanket and purple blankets and many treatments of the free energy principle is an instrumentalist one"
"Unknown","01;33;18;21","01;33;44;17","or in Pierce's even stronger terms see to an ominous interpretation of meaning first, blankets are realist not only in the non instrumental sense but also in the sense of being non nominal sentence. The modal terms of references are to real possibilities such as what's conceivable are produced by imagination anticipates really relates to the future. States of affairs are used in making sense of the key aspects of the theory."
"Unknown","01;33;44;28","01;34;14;08","We will argue in this paper the three energy principles being put at the center of a viable picture of an organism inside of the consequences of its action and its ability to choose the best or most efficient strategies that contribute to the fulfillment of best possible consequences. So not just consequences. Now, but over a temporal field, and I noted was realism in the philosophical position that posits that universes are just as real as physical, measurable material."
"Unknown","01;34;14;08","01;34;41;27","Nominalism is the philosophical position that promotes that universal are abstract concepts. I just lost my place. Sorry, I just made a new line. Abstract concepts do not exist in the same way as physical tangible material from instrumental to insight and insight or minimum to. We talk about that all the time because we're talking about relational and not just relative to rule."
"Unknown","01;34;41;27","01;35;04;29","We build categories, we generate hierarchies, and eventually we see patterns to model. We gain an insight. Then the pattern tested from Addie, there's another paper that I read about is it's fantastic called The New Light on Pierce, and I quoted from that. This is what Peirce had in mind when he wrote Lady. Well, that's reasonable to adopt a given hypothesis."
"Unknown","01;35;05;09","01;35;28;27","Reasonable? All right. If it will be wise to go to some expense to put the hypothesis to test dependent upon the advantage that that would accrue from knowing the truth of the hypothesis from that testing a result of consistency, i.e. repeatability comes universal things like laws, rules, axioms, etc. That's the stuff that in my diagram is on the right hand side."
"Unknown","01;35;29;15","01;35;59;09","This is the entirety of the proof. It is the entirety of the process. Real? Yes, because it's complex. A reality made up a process, some of which have no basis in reality. Again, from the new light on Peirce, again Addie's paper, the fourth memoir entitled Analysis of the Methods of Method Mathematical, opened with the affirmation that his first real discovery about mathematical procedure was that there are two kinds of necessary reasoning the collateral and the zero zero matic."
"Unknown","01;36;00;10","01;36;33;04","These, he explained as follows Collateral deduction is where it is only necessary to imagine any case in which the premises are true in order to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds. In that case, the aromatic deduction is a deduction in which it's necessary to experiment in the imagination upon the image of the premise. Then, in order from the result of which experiment to make sorry collateral deductions to the truth of the conclusion."
"Unknown","01;36;33;04","01;37;00;16","So again, this kind of hints that if we remove too many things and reduce too far. We are we we're left with nothing but instrumentals. So within those, within those bounded context that we have no arbitrarily parameter eyes, there's a whole bunch of things that we can pack into that silo and those things can move around and float around in there."
"Unknown","01;37;00;24","01;37;35;18","They're not constrained to the upper right and the lower left corner. Now all of a sudden, those by by directionality are indicators of just how much fluidity is going on as we pass from product and sweep across to insight. Steve, let me add a thought here. So just for reminder and reference other resources you'll find so much more, but deduction is the inference other about particular instances by referencing generalities, laws and principles."
"Unknown","01;37;35;26","01;38;08;01","Induction, in contrast, is where we go from what we observed with the instances up towards forming generalities. So deduction going down in that kind of a top down framing. It's very interesting that the deduction is split into two components here. You said collateral, I believe, and I think that may be totally valid, but I at least would read this as core aerial as of or related to a corollary will what have we heard?"
"Unknown","01;38;08;17","01;39;01;15","Nowhere else but here and elsewhere. Active inference is a corollary process theory of the free energy principle. So from a more general principle in the definition, the corollary old deduction is a situation where a case is only needed to be imagined, really imagines where the premises are true, propose a blanket where there's a particular entity and the blanket is separating them from the generative process in such and such a way such that the entity is a generative model and the internal states are doing some kind of mode tracking or path tracking of external states in a cybernetic good regulator framework."
"Unknown","01;39;01;15","01;39;30;10","The premise is merely a premise, it's not the culmination. So that's what we see in the corollary deduction. All you have to do is consider the premise to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds. In that case. Well, yes, if you propose setting up the base graph to be truly just that way as a corollary of the free energy principle, then that is already like a story that's been completed."
"Unknown","01;39;31;05","01;39;58;23","No one saying that you wrote the paper or that you had the startup that's profitable. But also no one can say that it's incorrect, that you've made a premise that kind of completed its arc. And then in the second case, we're still within deduction. However, it's necessary to experiment in the so a thought experiments which we can place into a setting of mental action and attention and counterfactuals."
"Unknown","01;39;58;23","01;40;29;16","Counterfactual generation requires the generation of counterfactuals. Ergo, it is abducted. It requires a generative phase and a selective phase. So we're going to generate and select. That's the objective loop that's happening with a when in a semantic space as part of this theorem ADIC deduction. And then the results of that experiment can be used to make correlate deductions to the truth of the conclusion."
"Unknown","01;40;30;21","01;41;20;18","So that's kind of counterfactuals on imagined premises. And guess what? It's real. Stephen Can I add one question in there and we have a make or deduction from a particular instance and we abducts the kind of best policy selection when we induce this induction. I see that as kind of a narrowing the gap. Often like there's a there's a general attitude and then a bit like reinforcement learning might try and do you induce in between."
"Unknown","01;41;21;15","01;41;59;10","And that's often what we see is most visible. You know, someone's trying to re, you know, reduce the gap in the physical world with the product that we've got that we're manipulating because that's kind of what we can see. I was speaking, I think earlier to Dean about this. You know, someone's making a pulse and they you know, they have the piece of clay that goes wobbly and they sort of make it into a pop, you know, so this kind of like the inducing inductively, trying to make it closer and closer to something that's more like the general of a pulse, but that's what we see."
"Unknown","01;42;00;04","01;42;24;19","And we would at some point we might not know what they're even doing. And then suddenly we deduce it supports because like you say, in this particular instance that being evoked. But behind all of that, that's abductee process is the bias. And I don't know whether the word bias semiotics is the term actually, I'm still not quite clear how to put that in there, but and I think that fits in with what you're saying."
"Unknown","01;42;24;22","01;43;12;04","And I wonder what your thoughts on that sort of inductive take, if I can just highlight how this comparison one relates to the realism, instrumental ism and the the clay pot creation. So here we have the quadrant separated again, totally speculating, working with Dean's graphical artistry in one totally defensible and absolutely scientific framing, the viewer of the construction could see their entire logical apparatus and inference about what is happening as an instrumental process happening."
"Unknown","01;43;12;05","01;43;38;07","I'm not saying that they're really making a I'm just saying that's a socially constructed term and it's totally contingent on my inculturation what I believe is a part. Maybe they're making a piece of art. Who am I to say that it's not something else? Maybe it could be used as a hammer so that places the inference about the system at the forefront and provides clarity as well as openness."
"Unknown","01;43;38;07","01;44;10;23","The edges of the drawing are open because it does leave a lot of structured ness surrounding the origin point again, but also room to go off many, many directions. What Magid returned our attention to was the nature of observations coming from the generative process, coming from the niche. If it's whimsical, as I think he said, well then yes, instrumental ism is fine in its totality."
"Unknown","01;44;10;23","01;44;35;19","However, if it's not whimsical, if there really is a table that you're going to get hit by, if that is really something that you're buying, if that is something with limited resources, we're doing or we're making a pot or we're making a pan, then the bounded ness is now moving to that scenario, which includes the the mindedness of all of the entities."
"Unknown","01;44;35;29","01;45;13;27","One entity is not speaking for the other, but that entity is seeing the situation as real, in that it is truly providing pragmatic implications for survival. And it's real meaning it's really bio semiotic meaning. And so here the balance is more around the situation. And in that space, in that room, there are paths among the theory where if you go into a different situation, you cross the line."
"Unknown","01;45;13;27","01;45;43;24","Now crossing a line is not always a bad thing, but all of a sudden, if someone's daydreaming about a totally different topic, they've exited the situation. But within the situation there are diversity of approaches here. The situation is actually being used just as in experimental context for a theoretician or a researcher in their removal to be able to consider different ways of modeling."
"Unknown","01;45;45;16","01;46;16;08","So I'm not sure if this is consistent or, you know, deine orthodoxy or heterodoxy, but I see the bounded ness as allowing for that center of action to be approached in a pragmatic, not a theoretical, but not academic approach. Whereas by making the divisions, cutting nature at the joints and like, oh wow, those joints correspond to longstanding philosophical debates in academia."
"Unknown","01;46;16;23","01;46;42;25","Who knew? And maybe don't always correspond to those joints. Yes, I know we're getting close to the end here. And so thank you for explaining that in your words. That helps me, because I'm always curious, too, whether or not the things that I'm trying to share actually are making sense to other people. And it sounds like maybe is is gaining some traction."
"Unknown","01;46;42;25","01;47;14;28","I want to say this one thing before we have to sign off here. Traditionally in most academic settings, and I'm as guilty of this as anybody because I was a curriculum designer for a part of my life. We start out trying to figure out how to construct a plan. And I think what activism affords is this idea that instead of instead of we construct a plan and then others follow it called a curriculum, what this potential is."
"Unknown","01;47;15;04","01;47;45;00","In addition to that, this is dismissing that or saying that that doesn't have its time in its place. But this does is asks us whether or not we could forage a plan, could we figure out how to fly, how to build the plane on the fly, that all this is is entertaining so that you actually have both. So when you're Sully and Hudson River has never traditionally been a landing strip, it becomes one."
"Unknown","01;47;45;00","01;48;23;05","But you need you need to think. And the do you need the action and the abduction? And so if you if you limit yourself to one or the other for the sake of not being cognitively overloaded, I get that. That's the deconstruction piece. But if you are foraging for a plan, the plan falls out of a product, your prior meld with your priorities, and then it self-evident what the plan is as opposed to somebody handing you a list and then you're simply following."
"Unknown","01;48;24;07","01;48;54;26","So I wanted to get that in before we have to call it a day, but I think that's important to sort of put put that context both in gripped and as gripper, because it's it's no more complicated or simple than that. Thanks. We are on our last slide now. We got through one of the six comparisons and the six were the tip of the iceberg off the tip."
"Unknown","01;48;54;26","01;49;39;11","So we know that we can never linear eyes or vocalize everything that needs to occur, but we also carry on so we can pause here, reflect on the last three videos in this series 40 701 and two. Where to now? How are we different after 47.2 than before or 47.0 then? My suggestion is that when we reflect, we are literally inducing."
"Unknown","01;49;39;23","01;50;18;15","We are literally looking back at the entire narrative or continuum or whatever you want to call it, and trying to figure out what just happened. So yeah, and I think that's when a lot of the stuff that's that's not instrumentalist turns real. I don't think people actually get a real sense of real time until they do the reflection, the classical scientific communication, public speaking advice, which I look forward to seeing how what Magid shared about economy of research reimagines the doing in the communication of science, of course."
"Unknown","01;50;18;15","01;50;46;25","But some of the classic advice is tell them what you're going to tell them. Tell them, and then tell them what you've told them. We can turn that into a bit more of a inactive or a planning based framing like consider what is about to happen. Abduction during the live stream. Think about what is happening. Attention and then after the live stream, consider what happens."
"Unknown","01;50;47;18","01;51;39;23","Reflection Know all of those processes are happening in the dot zero and two of each sentence of each person speaking turn in the videos and all these different scales. That's as real as anything. So it's really a nice hopefully sequence that we've engaged on and there may be more decimals to come on 47, certainly 48 and beyond will also carry forward in this historical way in which when we talk about concepts beyond 47, we'll have this shared basis of bringing abduction in and so on."
"Unknown","01;51;39;26","01;52;08;12","So Steven, any last thoughts? Yeah, I'd like to thank thanks for going here. I think we've had enough traction to show that there's a lot of value in trying to wrestle between and there is as well as that idea of the science, if you like. Then you mentioned the scientific communication where you have something that's quite clear to communicate."
"Unknown","01;52;08;12","01;52;42;01","There's also when it's opening up a space for something that could go down multiple different routes once it's contextualized. So I think that speaks to contextualizes situated in this and may and may require and may require some. I'm interested in how this may require some non-verbal kind of more experiential process in to like of certain cases to to explore."
"Unknown","01;52;42;01","01;53;04;23","So I think that might be open up the potential to sit in between and just take something from here and say, okay, what would that be like experientially? And just proving that. So that's something I'm going to explore what that might be like. Dean Penultimate words. I want to thank the two of you again for creating a kind of in Stevens Point, a kind of a safe space to take these kind of risks."
"Unknown","01;53;05;10","01;53;36;09","Because, again, we're not we're not just sticking to the script. We're kind of maybe triangulating like two scripts. And that that isn't always that doesn't mean that you're always going to be right. I mean, people come back and say, well, we have a wrong about this. I get to learn. But I think before that opportunity arose, prior to that, there were two people that are now sitting on my desktop here who who shared in that risk analysis effort."
"Unknown","01;53;36;09","01;54;01;00","And I want to thank both of you for being so supportive around taking this kind of that's let's hang it out there and see who salutes and who takes it down. Because if it's taken down, I'm, I'm I'm okay with that, too. But just being able to have the opportunity has been spectacular in terms of developing how I think ask not what you can do for your caller."
"Unknown","01;54;01;01","01;54;44;07","A process theory. See you fellows later. Thank you. Thank you."
