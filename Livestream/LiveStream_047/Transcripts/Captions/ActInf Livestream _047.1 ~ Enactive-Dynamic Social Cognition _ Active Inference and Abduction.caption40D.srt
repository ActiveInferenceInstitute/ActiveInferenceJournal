1
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,661
All right.

2
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,497
Hello. Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,134
It is active live stream number 47.1

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,370
on August 10th, 2022.

5
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,607
And we're continuing our explorations

6
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:45,812
into the paper dyad inactive dynamics,
social cognition and Active Inference

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,682
of Hippolyta and Venice
and Active Inference

8
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,986
and Abduction by Pierre Tanin and Bene.

9
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,523
Welcome to the Active Institute.

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,393
We're a participatory lab,
an institute that is communicating,

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,129
learning and practicing
applied active inference.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,131
Links are on the slide.

13
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,267
This is recorded
in an archived livestream,

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,537
so please provide us with feedback
so we can improve our work.

15
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,840
All backgrounds
and perspectives are welcome

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,310
and we'll be following video
etiquette for livestreams.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,316
Head over to active inference storage
to learn more about other projects

18
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:29,222
at the Institute and how to participate
and join learning groups.

19
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,959
Today in extreme 47.1,

20
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,029
we're continuing to learn and discuss

21
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,200
this pair of papers mentioned earlier
and on a previous video,

22
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,037
and we're going to

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,209
open with some introductions
and then probably just jump in wherever

24
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,313
anyone has a new question
they'd like to ask.

25
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,951
Maybe ending the introductions with Blue
so that you can bring

26
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,121
a new vector into the conversation.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,490
So I'm Daniel.

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm a researcher in California,
and I'm looking forward to

29
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,599
taking a one lens

30
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,902
a little bit to the paper, which had

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,673
an extended dot zero as there is so much

32
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,877
to learn on a few of these angles
and so much to kind of

33
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,880
think about that.

34
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,516
What is the difference between

35
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,584
being in the bathtub
and then in the middle

36
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,189
of the paper pair versus, for example,

37
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,026
coming into it to contextualize it
or trying to leave it to apply it.

38
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,362
Something in between, even there.

39
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,796
I'll pass it to Dean.

40
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,432
Thanks, Dean.

41
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,101
I'm here in Calgary.

42
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,539
I don't know if I don't know
what the DOT one needs

43
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,441
because we've never done a dot
one where we've tried to pull two things

44
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,144
but the proximal and see what happens

45
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:03,550
because sometimes that's fire and water
and just to get a lot of steam

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,620
and sometimes it's nature on glycerin
and the whole thing blows up on it.

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,722
So I'm kind of looking forward to that.

48
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,459
That's kind of the risky part
that I think is kind of exciting.

49
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,728
I'll pass it over to student.

50
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,764
Oh, thanks.

51
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,033
Dean Yeah, it's Stephen here in Toronto.

52
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,905
I'm really curious around
what this infusion

53
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,074
of two different approaches

54
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,311
to active movements can yield.

55
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,882
So what's behind it or what's behind

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,386
an approach of an activism
that brings in instrumental

57
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:45,558
is an approach that's more mathematically
focused, bringing in realism.

58
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,462
So I'm curious and hopefully it's
going to be useful and practical.

59
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,997
I'm going to pass over to

60
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,003
but. I am blue, I'm in New Mexico.

61
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,974
I really enjoyed reading.

62
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,444
So I've read the I think we did the hip

63
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:10,083
Alito paper before on another live stream
and as I've read that one before,

64
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,087
but I really enjoyed reading this
abduction and active in French paper.

65
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,992
I do not have like a strong
philosophy background,

66
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,362
so I kind of come at this like with
what is this?

67
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,431
But is that like,
I have to go search Wikipedia

68
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,003
100 million times
to kind of get more information about.

69
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,672
So from a philosophical aspect.

70
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,775
And so one of the key things like where

71
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,044
I was having a hard time, like locking in

72
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,247
on this abduction paper active

73
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,416
in France and abduction is

74
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,821
why do first in blankets

75
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,693
like like they presented
the authors presented it as if the first

76
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,730
like it's like necessitate
a realist perspective.

77
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,432
So so is that true?

78
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,736
And if so, why is that?

79
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,838
All right.

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,041
Thanks, everyone.

81
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,045
So two threads blew in what I heard

82
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,180
and I think two areas for us to kind of

83
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,152
get on the slide
and see at the same time.

84
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,890
So one was like different approaches
that can be taken both by an individual,

85
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,929
like different backgrounds in different
fields or disciplines, and then kind of

86
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,701
going beyond one person's just learning
trajectory and thinking, what are the

87
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:40,640
conceptual approaches that we can take
to, in this case, active inference.

88
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,677
But this might be studying
active inference

89
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,980
and applying acting inference
kind of both ways might come into play.

90
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,084
And then the question of the first

91
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,621
and blankets,
something like what aspects of what

92
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,324
enable

93
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,630
a situational realist
or a instrumentalist?

94
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,934
Just why are people taking
the stances they're taking

95
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,338
on a given situation

96
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,641
sometimes even like mixed across
different contexts

97
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,344
for the same system, they might use one
or another or something like that.

98
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,412
Steven

99
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,616
And this brings action
back into the equation.

100
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:28,955
I sense that action is quite important
because the idea of instrumentalist

101
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,424
in a way is there's a use of

102
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,993
certain instruments.

103
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:38,931
And that's that's the best way to think
of what's happening with the blankets.

104
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,934
Actually, I think it's really cool
that you brought the blankets up because

105
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,537
that question

106
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,407
comes in and it activates like

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,710
the temptation
is to make everything realist.

108
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,146
And then it's like, okay,
we got a blanket.

109
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,350
So it's kind of like, well, maybe
we should make sure we keep the blanket

110
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,487
question in an instrumental way
to avoid all those traps.

111
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:06,392
And then on the other side, it's
like on the math side, it's like, well,

112
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,563
these tension funded mental

113
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,966
dynamics

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,336
well, as they're being acted in some way,

115
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,541
they must have some relation to reality
in some way.

116
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,012
So it's sort of almost the mirror
is not the mirror, but it's something

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,649
that's sitting on the other side
in an interesting way.

118
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,418
I don't know what Dana thinks
in that point, but.

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,692
I was going to mention that I,

120
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,129
I think if we are taking two papers
and actually

121
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,333
doing a bit of what happens
when they get entangled,

122
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,304
then we're looking at what happens
when something is actively inferred

123
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:56,542
as a process as opposed to active
inference as a subject matter or topic.

124
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,480
And so when we do that,
we're essentially asking

125
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,851
the big questions
on one of the next slide here is

126
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,521
so is active inference both as process,

127
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,726
as actively inferring and of process,
something falls out of that.

128
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:19,799
And we, we asked it in the, in the using
metaphor of being both a gripper.

129
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,267
Right.

130
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,638
Something as process thing
and a process being gripped.

131
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,106
And so

132
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,376
yeah, I think if we, if we,

133
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:34,113
if we actually look at it as what's,
what's going on,

134
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,751
not just from the doing sense,
but from the observing sense

135
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:44,323
or participatory sense,
I think it leaves us with no choice

136
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:50,229
but to say that there's got to be
some going back and forth between both.

137
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,433
But that's just my take.

138
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,973
So let me let me read this
quote from the paper specifically

139
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,378
going back to to the blanket,
the one that set off my, my, my question.

140
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,914
But that's like unanswered.

141
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,283
If says

142
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,420
okay, according
to recent interpretations of the FP,

143
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,457
the dynamical interaction
of living systems and the external world

144
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,661
under active inference can be interpreted
semantically.

145
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,231
This is a Ramstad 2020 citation
by assuming

146
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,302
that sensory states are meaningful
representations of the reality.

147
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,505
This is especially the case if we assume

148
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,941
that the development of Markov blankets
by Friston,

149
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,778
unlike their original characterization
and works of Judea Pearl

150
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,982
on probabilistic causal networks, admit
a realist interpretation

151
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:48,421
of the relationship
between the organism and the environment.

152
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,691
So it says,
while the role of the concepts of Markov

153
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,627
blankets and Perl blankets
in many treatments of the free energy

154
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,497
principle is an instrumentalist
one or as in Pearson's even stronger

155
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:02,401
terms, concede to a nominal list
interpretation of their meaning.

156
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,772
Fashion blankets are realist
not only in the non instrumentalist

157
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,610
sense, but also in the sense of being non
nominal list entities.

158
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,715
The modal terms of references to real
possibilities such as what is conceivable

159
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,719
or produced by imagination
or anticipatory li related to the future.

160
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,757
States of affairs are used in making
sense of the key aspects of the theory

161
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,727
and so

162
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,263
in my recollection
the first didn't think it like I didn't

163
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,701
have that linked to realism necessarily
per say.

164
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:41,040
So Daniel like maybe Kant,
do you have any more clarification?

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,675
Like, is that like a realist?

166
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,812
A blanket is a realist
interpretation of the blanket

167
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:51,183
or or am I just forgetting that?

168
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,619
But I read that part.

169
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,022
I didn't know what Nominalism was.

170
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,993
So according to the summary,
the view that Universals and abstract

171
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,797
objects do not actually exist
other than being merely

172
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,834
names or labels.

173
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,539
One version denies

174
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:18,611
the existence of universals,
the other the abstract.

175
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,080
So it's an anti generalist position.

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,687
So let's see where that was used
with the first and blanket,

177
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,990
because this is the

178
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,392
crux of the discussion.

179
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,263
Like one of the frontiers of contact
other than just saying, well,

180
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,733
and activism and dynamical systems
theory work like this coarsely

181
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,836
or this broad area
math and chemistry work

182
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,972
together like this.

183
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:51,110
This is starting to get into
the real contact points of

184
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:57,650
turf semantically that are being vied
over.

185
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:02,021
People have different perspectives
on how to interpret

186
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,159
base graphs in different contexts.

187
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,531
And so then the mark of blanket is like
it still might even be too coarse grains

188
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,270
to for that whole turf
to be controlled by one view or another.

189
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,372
So then

190
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,676
let's look at how

191
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,545
the abduction paper

192
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,948
and anything else that you see,

193
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,551
where would it be more justified,

194
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:36,589
just in your sense?

195
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,459
Well, and then we'll unpack this,
because I think this was just copied in

196
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,497
to discussed today,
since it's obviously a clear area

197
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,533
where both papers are talking
about their view on the mark of Blanket,

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,671
which might make it clearer
to see how multiple views on

199
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,841
blankets and graphs

200
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,276
come into play.

201
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,712
But let's unpack
both of their perspectives.

202
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,349
Saying the nominal list

203
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,452
interpretation and as as you're unpacking
that, it's something

204
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:11,690
I didn't have to look up because it's
a very prominent theme in Buddhism.

205
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:12,558
Right.

206
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,961
Like, like that, you know,

207
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,665
it's like the absence
of any kind of inherent existence.

208
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,767
Like said, that existence is nominal.

209
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,672
And so it's interesting
that in this abduction paper

210
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,176
that they take this this,

211
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,146
you know, construction
by Peirce of Nominalism.

212
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,383
But but also,
like more than once in that paper,

213
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,753
they point to an objective reality,

214
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,257
which is like if
if things are interpreted, interpreted,

215
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,562
if all stuff is
nominally interpreted, then

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,733
what is the subjective reality
other than like linguistics

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,303
or semantics or perhaps semiotics?

218
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,004
Yeah.

219
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:04,210
So even

220
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,780
that's a very good point

221
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,417
because it also ties back to you
mentioned about when we're talking

222
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,120
about the relationship
almost being the reality,

223
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,958
I sense that they were kind of saying
if there's a relationship,

224
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,964
those relational dynamics,
I didn't use the word dynamics, therefore

225
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,633
have some

226
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:33,772
it's can be called real, you know,
which I think is a fair assertion

227
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:37,910
in some senses,
although, you know, again,

228
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,580
that could be an overextension
because there's a question about

229
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,084
how much you go into transcendental

230
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,387
and how much you go down

231
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:53,993
into the kind of more morphology
and the whole morphogenesis.

232
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,161
And there's actually a really good
there's a

233
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,799
actual La-Z-Boy is actually
it does a lot of work

234
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,902
with search of the oppressed
and work with

235
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,372
people
who've been tortured and stuff like that.

236
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,540
And he talks about

237
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,544
the medicine is in the wounds,
the medicine is in the wounds

238
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,547
when people get no

239
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,582
coma, etc..

240
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,751
And one of the things that's interesting
there is that

241
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,388
we may be in a culture,

242
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,557
there's times
when we might try to explain things or

243
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,761
do transcendental work

244
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,698
to to transcend a situation or avoid us.

245
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,566
And we may actually avoid the situation.

246
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,204
But sometimes when you go into the wound,
what you might find

247
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,407
is is literally a bloody mess.

248
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,811
So that may not be real

249
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,982
in the normal sense.

250
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,117
Then let's start out a little bit.

251
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,554
I think it's interesting that most
representations of Markoff, I could show

252
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,257
the markup blanket in between

253
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,894
to two distinct

254
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,198
sets of properties

255
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,401
and that's always represented
on the horizontal.

256
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,571
And I think what's interesting here
is that if

257
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,808
if you exactly if you find yourself

258
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,844
in a in a debate situation

259
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,681
of two top down perspectives,
one that says

260
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,618
it must be from the top down and active

261
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,257
or it must be from the
top down some some series of

262
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,259
some series or

263
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,131
set of different logics
apply depending upon your familiarity

264
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,868
with what it is that you're observing,
that can lead

265
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,971
to that whole question of

266
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,041
hierarchy,
and then what entails the other.

267
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,711
So for me, it's pretty

268
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,281
it's pretty easy to understand why

269
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,452
people who take the exclusive position of

270
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,722
instrumental ism

271
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,191
as entailing

272
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,394
something like logic

273
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,663
or the other hierarchical relations

274
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,401
chip of the logic being the real thing,

275
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:22,074
and then the actions to follow, or
that's the thing that's being entailed.

276
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,811
I think what the diagrams,
what a lot of the pictures tell us

277
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:31,250
is that there's
a lateral aspect to this as well.

278
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,021
And so if we're going to look at that
lateral less

279
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,559
which which is enveloping
the other top down view

280
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,896
because both of the views
in both of these papers,

281
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,066
if the bias or the

282
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,802
the position that the authors take
is one of top

283
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,038
down, what what rules under

284
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,342
this set of conditions or circumstances,
placing those two things side

285
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:02,147
by each strips away
some of the questions around relativity

286
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,585
and now introduces
the idea of around relationship,

287
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,855
but not relationship
in terms of power over

288
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,760
but relationship in terms
of what needs to be present in order

289
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,165
for somebody to be able
to actually make fewer prediction errors.

290
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:25,571
So the mark up blanket,
I think can be turned.

291
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,675
I mean, right now, most of it is
is perceived as being some sort

292
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,478
of a vertical partition between

293
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,280
lateral elements.

294
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,149
I mean, it can be flipped.

295
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,121
And we've talked often in lots of papers
about what's the hierarchical structure,

296
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,723
what's the bottom
up, what's the top down.

297
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,759
But I think both of these papers

298
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,131
admittedly say we are taking a top down
view of this

299
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,534
and therefore
they are constraining themselves

300
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,403
to more

301
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,108
emphasis on the relativity aspect of

302
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,946
what is going on in in it
in an actively inferring way.

303
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,318
Then they are looking at it
as a relationship between the sensing

304
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:22,427
and the act.

305
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,964
Right? Well, a lot of stuff.

306
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,300
Let's go through the abduction.

307
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,602
Markoff blanket discussion.

308
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,007
The first part is
the statement of context,

309
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,609
potentially
for a philosophical background.

310
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,612
But it's important
that they're placing this

311
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,983
along
the lines of other places in biology.

312
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,820
So these are systems
that are self perpetuating

313
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:54,059
in a diffusive multi-scale self
way perhaps, but they're self creating.

314
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,097
We're not just taking them as existing
in a certain contrived arrangement.

315
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,334
5 minutes ago
we're thinking about systems that have

316
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,305
maintained a non equilibrium
steady state with their environments

317
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,540
and if not the end.

318
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,243
If someone denies
the realism or the anything

319
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:12,811
of the

320
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,215
environment, then that

321
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,917
can be verbalized and even cognizant.

322
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:23,722
But it is not enacted
by persistent systems either.

323
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,959
From the view from the inside
or like if one

324
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,363
just stops breathing or something
like that, or the view from the outside.

325
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,234
Because again, systems with persistent
measurements have to be at least

326
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,805
doing well enough to persist amidst
the regularities, the environment.

327
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,207
So this is kind of like grounding it

328
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,509
in an evolutionary
and developmental framework,

329
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,646
but connecting it to the non-equilibrium
steady state maintenance,

330
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,783
which is grounding this realism
discussion in a relationship

331
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,686
with the environments,
not as like in a priori.

332
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,689
Then there's a definition of Markoff

333
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,523
blanket

334
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,860
the blanket state

335
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,964
conditional independence
between notes in a base graph,

336
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,166
which doesn't mean
that influence doesn't travel

337
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,203
or that those states
aren't semantically about each other,

338
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,440
but it means that they're conditionally
independent in a statistical way.

339
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,210
External states

340
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,580
in supposed I'm not sure this author,

341
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,016
but the end of Semiotic View

342
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,754
would be like potentially meaning
on the inside.

343
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,257
Like photons on the retina
really are light.

344
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,893
It really is the case
that that's the real thing

345
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,063
within that facet of biological function

346
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,467
and internal states
describe from exo's semiotic perspective.

347
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,004
So perhaps like the interpretive view,
so a view from the inside,

348
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:49,007
the true influence of a of a feature,

349
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:53,178
and the kind of studying of a view
from the outside where those agree.

350
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,415
You have some meiosis
like with a stop sign

351
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,152
and it means stop in the situation
with different entities.

352
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,089
This speaks directly to active inference

353
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,792
given that the regulation
of the entropy of the internal state.

354
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,960
So all these functions
that we're describing

355
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,463
as being like bounded
or constrained or minimized

356
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,567
or having to do with that interfaces

357
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,770
surprise control on action, outgoing

358
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:24,776
and then bounded, surprise on perception,
which is also very force age

359
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,847
by like the perceptual control
theory and various motor theories

360
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,117
which we've talked about,
but like the reflex arc

361
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,053
challenging the way that people

362
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,391
models decision making, for example.

363
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:45,330
Then in many
treatments they're agreeing that people

364
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,467
take an instrumentalist usage or stance

365
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,039
first, and blankets are released
not only in the non instrumentalist

366
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,209
sense, opens up

367
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,411
a whole discussion with non and anti,

368
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:06,118
but also in the sense of being non
non ist entities.

369
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:11,790
And then in this last quote,
it would be great to hear more

370
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,527
from the authors about what
the modal terms of reference are.

371
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,462
But the part that stands out here

372
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:22,934
is the real possibilities,
because for these systems,

373
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,974
with these features engaging in this way,

374
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,144
their cognition can be considered real

375
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,615
to the extent
it has all of these features

376
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,718
and is tied to the environment over time
and so on.

377
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,755
Hope that is one view on it

378
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:48,126
because many paragraphs in the abducted
paper and an inactive paper,

379
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,330
if you
really engage with their structured

380
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,401
arguments, there's
some much to like read in between and

381
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,272
to respect the way that they've laid
out the argument,

382
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,776
while also hopefully now all
seeing interesting ways to connect it.

383
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,679
So Stephen and then anyone else?

384
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,049
Yeah, this is a little bit
so feeding back to you, Daniel.

385
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,085
So in case
you've got a thought on this one, because

386
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,422
the, you know, there's the,

387
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,827
there's the, the biological aspect here
that you bring it up.

388
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,695
And I agree with that.

389
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:29,201
And, you know, in the work on the brain
just has been talking about

390
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,271
moving from, say, a causal correlation
to a functional correlation.

391
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,008
And there can be many ways of
getting somewhere when it's functional.

392
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,112
So then, right, of course, in this case,
there's a certain element of

393
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:43,381
what's

394
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,585
real in
terms of what we scientifically is.

395
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,886
It's scientific realism.

396
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:52,591
As a scientist, what is real in
what's being scientifically deducted.

397
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,195
So if it's been deductive,
it is a perspective that's being taken.

398
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:01,199
So within the perspective
that's been taken on a certain

399
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,870
state, it's not equal of Librium
steady states.

400
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,240
Where is that

401
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,442
regime of attention,
the scientific regime

402
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:14,846
at attention,
purely an instrument to be considered?

403
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,950
Or is it for the things it's analyzing
that could be real.

404
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,354
So there could be so the get out clause

405
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,124
yet they could still be phenomenon

406
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,530
rather than perspectives and logic
sitting underneath

407
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,101
that which have many dynamics
to get to the same outcome.

408
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:41,006
So what's your thoughts on that then?

409
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,942
My thought is I want to hear
what Blue and Dean would say on it.

410
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,745
Okay, come.

411
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,547
Yeah, Steve first.

412
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,814
Go ahead, go ahead.

413
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,784
Loop each. You.

414
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,453
Know, go for it then.
I want to hear what you have to say.

415
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:55,754
Okay.

416
00:25:55,754 --> 00:26:00,125
Well, what I hear here's
an interesting thing about both papers

417
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,092
and maybe,

418
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,563
maybe the authors of the papers
will push back hard on this, but that's

419
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,297
what I'm used to.

420
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,200
Both papers take a scientific perspective
on this,

421
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,638
very much a scientific perspective,
which in my books is easily

422
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,277
as an idiom, is when I see it,
I'll believe it.

423
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,712
They want the evidence, right?

424
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,081
They want it.
They want that sort of inductive,

425
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,517
deductive piece
to sort of sit front and set.

426
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,853
They want proof, which is great,
I get that.

427
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,757
But what I think
is really fascinating about this is while

428
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,826
they are holding up

429
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,731
that that epistemic priority,

430
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:44,202
they're also talking a lot about,
I'll invert that.

431
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,872
And they say I'll believe it
when I see it.

432
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,942
So there's a lot of faith in this.

433
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,546
It hasn't materialized yet,
but if I continue to exist

434
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,149
in a social setting or as an agent,

435
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,821
yes. What I've got to have faith
that all this time

436
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:07,225
that keeps rolling
out, I'm going to continue

437
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,463
for whatever
purposes, goals or directives

438
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,966
I'm taking to work through

439
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,503
the not seeing it until I actually

440
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,407
arrive at that moment
where something materializes,

441
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,443
when I can say,
Oh, now I have the evidence.

442
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,646
So there's are both papers.

443
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,881
Have a real

444
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,751
they play they play with themselves.

445
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,852
They dance with themselves

446
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:38,390
in the sense that they are both papers
from an exclusive standpoint saying we

447
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,526
we are looking at this scientifically
and mathematically.

448
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,864
And yet in order
for us to be able to hold on to this

449
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,868
this this, this thought
or idea of the ATP

450
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,371
being, you know, I'm

451
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,175
I'm I'm whatever it's called,
steady state.

452
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,244
I've just lost the expression.

453
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,112
Non-Equilibrium Thank you.

454
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,814
Non-Equilibrium steady state.

455
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,685
I do have to believe in something
in order for whatever

456
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,156
materialization, goal or outcome I'm
I'm moving towards it.

457
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:16,628
That's almost Oasis or Alice Thesis
or I want a sandwich 5 minutes from now.

458
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,498
I have to believe in that thing
or my agency

459
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,435
or my ability to achieve or attain

460
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,271
before I can actually have that thing.

461
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:32,043
So from from from that alone,
I find it really interesting

462
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,314
that there's a certain amount of naivete
in both papers.

463
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:40,118
There's a kind of a we have to
keep our hat to this rookie view

464
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,355
that every time we realize something,

465
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,891
there has to be a little bit of faith

466
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,695
or a little bit of belief
in what's going on.

467
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,464
Those priors actually

468
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,000
exist, and I'm going to use them

469
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,704
because I want to carry out
whatever my priorities are.

470
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:05,276
And it doesn't matter whether it's the
top down newness of abduction and logic

471
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:10,148
or the top down units of an activism,
they both tip their hat to the bottom.

472
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,084
Happiness of I got to kind of have a

473
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,954
I got to kind of have a confidence that

474
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,224
so that even if it's not here now,

475
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,294
at some point it will either continue

476
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,631
the way I want it to or whatever change
I want to impose on it.

477
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:32,670
I have that capacity to wait it out
and have that thing happen.

478
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,541
So yeah, that's what I would add

479
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,645
to what Steven was saying.

480
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,781
Luke Yes. So.

481
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,183
So I'll say a couple of things

482
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,085
that I

483
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,255
was looking at just now, the difference

484
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,025
between a Christian
like what is a Christian blanket?

485
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,327
And I came across a paper
that we're going to have to discuss.

486
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,898
It's called Scientific Realism
about Christian Blankets

487
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:05,236
Without Literalism,
and it's by Christine and Kirchhoff.

488
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,906
So someday we're going to have to have
that.

489
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,975
It's a preprint
up on philosophical archives now.

490
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,445
So so apparently like having a real

491
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,315
boundary can be like literal.

492
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,450
Like there's like
a literal interpretation

493
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,885
or a realist interpretation.

494
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,055
And so just like I'm
still trying to narrow down

495
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:28,626
like what is this realist interpretation
of a Christian blanket?

496
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:34,165
And yeah, so in also a very real sense

497
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,236
like what is the real boundary
of a living thing?

498
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,906
Like I don't,
I can't find my real boundary.

499
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,974
Like, where do I stop?

500
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,043
And something else begins.

501
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,946
There are like hundreds and trillions.

502
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,780
I don't even know

503
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,483
more non human cells in my body
than there are human cells like.

504
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,018
So I always have to come back to this.

505
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,921
So what would I be
without all of those non-human things?

506
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:01,526
Are those non-human things also me like
but then like, you know, I'm constantly

507
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,997
like ingesting new ones
and excreting old ones and so like,

508
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,333
and they're coming into my skin
and leaving my skin.

509
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,535
So where is my boundary?

510
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,972
Like, do I have to have this boundary
in order for active inference

511
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:18,243
and like the Markoff
blanket interpretation to apply?

512
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,144
I don't know that that's

513
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,882
necessarily true.

514
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,784
So like I could just get off of it.

515
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,753
I love this paper and I love

516
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,657
like the semiotic interpretation
in like the objective sense.

517
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,293
Like, but does it even really matter?

518
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,427
Like like

519
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,598
so the realist interpretation,
like to someone who doesn't believe

520
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,768
in like a shared
objective reality is never going to work.

521
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,804
Or like, can you find the boundary?

522
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,241
Like where is this line
between self and other or like between

523
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,911
like like I can't find the boundary.

524
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,548
So like for me
it's all a modeling perspective

525
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,753
that doesn't lessen
the impact of this abduction

526
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,122
as active inference paper for me at all.

527
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,325
Like I really thought
it was a great paper and has a lot of

528
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,995
really cool things
to say about cognition and perception.

529
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,465
So like,
why are we hung up on this still?

530
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,402
I don't know. Or

531
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:18,870
both of you

532
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,973
go for it and then I'll add some notes.

533
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,876
Could I just add one more note? Yep.

534
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,345
I mean, I think look, I agree

535
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,549
with totally with Dean on this
this bottom up phenomenon.

536
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,052
You know, that's that's going to be there
in the background.

537
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:38,156
Maybe it's always going to be unknowable,
apart from some of these simulations

538
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,090
giving us insights.

539
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,428
But I think also what Blue is saying
there is for me

540
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,164
this whole boundary question

541
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,000
is where is the problem with a systems

542
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,738
discussion in terms of that
being kind of naturalized?

543
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,542
And I think that it
because you end up with

544
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,045
because systems are defined that way,
what's inside, what's outside.

545
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,948
And for me, the big revelation

546
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,385
and I think for a lot of people,
maybe in the biological sciences,

547
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:11,823
it's not so unusual to think this way,
but to think about agent based modeling,

548
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,195
to think about where where's the agent,
where's the agency, the teleology.

549
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,130
And that

550
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,135
agency
doesn't necessarily sit on a boundary

551
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,305
in the same way that systems tend to.

552
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,141
I mean, someone could argue
that it doesn't have to,

553
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,344
and I'm sure it doesn't,
but it ends in many ways ends up there.

554
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,780
Right. In reality, in terms of discourse.

555
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,150
So, you know,
we want that discourse to be clear.

556
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,252
We're doing this work with systems
engineering to have it

557
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:45,923
where we want these clear divisions
for the purpose of ontological discourse.

558
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:50,361
So we know what we're talking about
and why, however, which is where

559
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,332
maybe there's a challenge
this agent agency,

560
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,667
teleology, gee, morphological

561
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,906
dynamics are something else than that.

562
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,877
And I'll pass that to Daniel and maybe
his answer will come in somewhere.

563
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,212
I'm not sure. Yeah, Dean first.
Then I'll go for it.

564
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,781
I'll be real quick here.

565
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,717
So in some of the diagrams,
I know that, Daniel, you're you're

566
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,285
you're really good at this.

567
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,888
Some of the diagrams,
the markup, like it is literally a

568
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,525
an oval with the word discrepancy in it.

569
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,594
And so all I would to to

570
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,364
to add on to what you were saying is that

571
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,636
if you want a hard physical boundary
and you want to discover what that is,

572
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,772
I think you're looking at it again.

573
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,874
What where is this?

574
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:42,013
Where is does one thing and and another
thing start as a relativity question?

575
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:47,351
What I'm suggesting is if you're looking
at the bottom up and the top down

576
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,622
as a relationship,
not as which is which is more powerful

577
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:56,294
or holds more influence over the other,
you're looking at that as a relationship.

578
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,532
And it's that relationship holds
as a discrepancy zone.

579
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:07,238
It's not necessarily something
that has the physical beginning and end.

580
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,041
It's kind of it kind of fluid.

581
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,811
And it and it's it's not to say

582
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,514
we shouldn't
look at the relativity at all.

583
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:20,251
It is to say, let's have one eye
on the relativity piece.

584
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,821
And the other eye on the relationship
is the discrepancy

585
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:30,061
between it doesn't
it doesn't lend itself to hard stops.

586
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,965
It's discrepancy if that's all that is.

587
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,733
That's just what it is.

588
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,171
It means we're not sure about anything
other than the difference.

589
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,809
We don't know where
where the separation boundary is.

590
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,611
But that's kind of where this rule.

591
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,947
Let's bring these two papers
together thing came from, because

592
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,251
if we're actively inferring,

593
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,220
we can bound around that discrepancy.

594
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,923
It doesn't always have to be a partition.

595
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,826
That's
what the that's what the importance is.

596
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,463
You're potentially
if we can have two things

597
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,299
being held simultaneously or

598
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:12,503
co-occurrence.

599
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,072
All right. Wow. Well, well blocked there.

600
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:20,912
Well, first one, the discrepancies
textbook figure to three, discrepancy.

601
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,549
Not a blanket or discrepancy
as blanket of blanket, etc..

602
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,619
And that can be a continuous
or discrete value.

603
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,689
But in non idealized

604
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,560
like non
singular path of least action settings

605
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,562
a.k.a real

606
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,565
settings,
there's always a non-zero value.

607
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,335
So that's one way to leave the door,
always a little open

608
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,839
in a way that just having to feed on zero

609
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,311
or one or any rapid
switching strategies of zeros and ones

610
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,215
doesn't really capture
that in the same way then.

611
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,749
BLUM Great question.

612
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,719
Like we asked a little bit

613
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,722
about at the beginning, why?

614
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,158
What is leading someone to consider
something

615
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,829
like a blanket in a realist
or an instrumentalist light

616
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,000
and pointed to factors
like the persistence of the organism

617
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,637
and the reality of like the action
inflow with its environments.

618
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,639
So it kind of forces
somebody to say, well,

619
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,810
if the environment is real,
then the entity and the actions and the

620
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,845
meiosis of their actions are real.

621
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,681
If stop signs are real
and stopping at a stop sign is real

622
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,184
and they're all part of the
non-equilibrium steady state,

623
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,620
what, what

624
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,056
further realism does one want to know
then that

625
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,760
there is a territory and then this is
the maps of the territory.

626
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,831
So some are going to go all the way
into territory skepticism

627
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,034
or how will they
then reframe their stance

628
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:56,240
then on the
just a few other random pieces,

629
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,478
this was in Live Stream three
when we read about communication

630
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,514
and active inference.

631
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,617
And they are,
which is a lot of in the social

632
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,087
and action setting
that we're bringing this objective

633
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,824
light to the social and active setting
that's really like

634
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:19,263
expounded upon in the Polito
and van ass paper that that goes

635
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:23,901
into a lot of the scientific
and philosophical aspects of social.

636
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,172
So here they're borrowing

637
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,309
from the framework
of Tinbergen for questions

638
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,280
and providing multiple scales of analysis

639
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,750
that are all like the four whys.

640
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,820
And these four Ys are kind of

641
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,956
like a two by two quadrant.

642
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,894
And so then that allows in biology

643
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,130
parallel of research agendas

644
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,800
and integration

645
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,803
because like the fact that brain regions
are connected to each other up

646
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:03,307
here on the mechanism side
is part of the picture, but it's a yes.

647
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:07,611
And with the pattern of DNA
divergence times

648
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,315
like you could imagine situations
where they're correlated or not

649
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:14,385
and they could be causing it or not,
and it could be either way of causation

650
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,654
or a confounding factor
or any other number of things.

651
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,724
And then neither of those have a direct

652
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,594
closed door
on like what the birdsong sounds like.

653
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,764
So without even going into
what the birdsong is like, interpreted

654
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:30,901
as there still is space within that

655
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,039
interpretive
or semiotic scientific approach,

656
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,943
that is

657
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,213
hopefully as we can explore,

658
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,581
considering

659
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,118
the research in that application

660
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,520
in a different way
than it's been partitioned

661
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:58,229
in certain
specific analyzes in the past, then

662
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,332
well.

663
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,802
So I'll, I'll throw something out there
knowing that

664
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,205
I had not really thought about it more
than while I was listening to you talk.

665
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,177
So if it's completely wrong, somebody
can can correct me really quickly.

666
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,781
I think it's really interesting
that both of these papers

667
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:21,485
provide
what I would consider to be a stable

668
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:27,525
or a stabilizing effect
on what we might describe

669
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:32,430
as something resembling strategy
for the potential for strategy.

670
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,101
What I'm always thinking about is
that strategy is not behavior behaviors.

671
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:42,940
Usually, given the label tactics,
but that strategy does

672
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,911
include the anticipation and the logic
that is applied.

673
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,449
And I think that's
where we're not in conflict.

674
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:57,588
When we say there's a triadic
and there's a code construction

675
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,292
of the social scene,
because I think both of those things

676
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,297
provide the still stability
or the platform then to strategize

677
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,333
and minimize those prediction errors.

678
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,636
So again, we can still

679
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,206
we can still build off of strategy and do

680
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,843
and we can still build off of strategy
and eliminate

681
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,581
constant, bad, consequential decisions.

682
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,752
So, again,
that's the relationship as as opposed

683
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,657
to which one of these two approaches,
these two top down approaches

684
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,996
is the
is the thing that holds the most sway,

685
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,567
because at any given time, well, one
or the other are both.

686
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,137
As long as you don't get trapped in one

687
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,242
would actually be the most

688
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,646
I would think would be the most option
generating, not option.

689
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,150
So I think as you talk in the adduction
paper about the different types

690
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,354
of abduction, what they do

691
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,390
handle,
they emphasize all of that in the end,

692
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:10,861
both of those types, the generating
and the selecting are essentially

693
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,265
you can't
you can't have one without the other.

694
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:18,202
So that's an interesting thing
to incorporate here as well,

695
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,871
or at least considered.

696
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,641
I'm not saying you have to take it up,

697
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,177
but if you did,
what would that look like.

698
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,982
Or just directly respond to a few pieces
there, then Steven and then anyone else.

699
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,686
So very interesting connection

700
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,822
with Multiscale

701
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,593
prediction error
or free energy minimization uncertainty

702
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:46,797
reduction surprises
abounding in Multi-Scale systems.

703
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:51,101
And then in this social and active
setting that Hippolyta

704
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:57,408
and Vance brought to the forefront,
that is our gripper and grips

705
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,812
in a way that a little

706
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,547
experiment

707
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,584
on a fixed mirror, active inferences item

708
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,020
or a system described
by any of the conventional mechanics,

709
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,792
classical physics, mechanics, statistical
thermodynamics, quantum

710
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,362
you're kind of
just going off on a prelude

711
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,031
to upcoming discussions with Dalton,

712
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:25,970
but I think that will pull out an aspect
which is that the Bayesian mechanics

713
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,206
broadens that discussion into

714
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,210
the cognitive dynamics
of active particles.

715
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,547
And so in that way,
a ball following becomes

716
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,983
like a special case of active particles
falling

717
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,087
that could take various paths
based upon their embodied affordances,

718
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,090
even if just described as,

719
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,293
if like the baseballs
not following the parabola equation,

720
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:54,498
but that's how the real environment
and active particle interact,

721
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,202
which is to say some melodically,
which is why they both

722
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,072
papers
mention abduction in the social context.

723
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,478
And then you mentioned
like these two top down perspectives

724
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:12,950
and how when we have the divergence
between among like multi

725
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:18,355
three body problem, we have multiple
ideas, minimum of two, hopefully more.

726
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,591
And then there are strange attractors.

727
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,961
There's, there's Lifestream
32, there's life from 26.

728
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,798
Everything happens in that space
from the top down

729
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,535
because there's always going to be
a plurality from the bottom up.

730
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:36,974
So the one error that wouldn't
just be the right course

731
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,244
training for sure is a singular

732
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:45,549
I of more laser.

733
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:49,353
And that leads to basically
the unexpected,

734
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,756
unexpected
with the reality of the bottom up.

735
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,193
And then
when there's divergence is in continuous

736
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,363
state spaces
and paths in between top down,

737
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,934
then there's a bi
directional relationship

738
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,538
with the top down in the bottom up
or the inside out in the outside in,

739
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,006
because you could even move

740
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,443
among those without feeling
like we were like violating a system

741
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,612
to sometimes
use a left to write for time,

742
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,382
or then we could use right
to left for time.

743
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,218
And so seeing those kinds of

744
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,687
cognitive moves as accessible

745
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,622
in a social setting

746
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,758
and then taking that course.

747
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,093
Lastly to

748
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:29,560
you said that

749
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,496
the two stroke engine of abduction
with the generating and selecting

750
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,735
because the laser is not on the generator

751
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,870
and that's the about
the analogy of attention

752
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,441
in a top down system
like we've seen models and mental action

753
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,410
several times.

754
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,613
Stephen Yeah, thanks Daniel.

755
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:53,150
You would,
you really go back to that four

756
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,652
by four that you had there

757
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,322
with the ultimate yeah.

758
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:04,128
And I think that this is really important
because there's also this

759
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,364
implicit enlightenment

760
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,601
assumption
that was always sitting in the background

761
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,737
where up is good.

762
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,173
And I think it's really interesting that

763
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,942
and I think you're absolutely right,
we talk about it talks about ultimate.

764
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,379
So I think it's really curious
and it talks about

765
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:26,183
we talk about this interactions
is this kind of interaction.

766
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:31,522
This is the ultimate set of interactions,
the robin and that is what the truth is

767
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:36,660
seen as what's the rational truth
when we go up and we get enlightened.

768
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,430
So then we can project down on
what's there and the idea of that,

769
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,300
what's coming up is interaction.

770
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,068
So that's the general way it's thought.

771
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,871
And there was this
magic box called Emergence

772
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,641
to sort of get around the fact
that really we didn't know.

773
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,611
But I would I would challenge that
not not to say that

774
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,182
that's not true
in terms of how it's perceived, but

775
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,386
there's another way
that bottom up can be explored,

776
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,088
and that is another way
that truth can be explored.

777
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,824
This is rational truth

778
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:11,161
and this
which I thought ultimate is quite

779
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,265
I get the sense that that is very much
looking out as this

780
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,068
is built into those words. Right.

781
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,437
This assumption that of of enlightenment.

782
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,073
But there's also intimate truth.

783
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,809
Intimate truth

784
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,878
is different to rational truth.

785
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,381
And intimate truth
is not about interactions.

786
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:34,818
It's about knowing.

787
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,920
It's about a deeper kind of knowing.

788
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,825
So when I go down, it's
not what's coming up in a bottom up.

789
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,194
It's, What am I going?

790
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,897
Well, my only way to engage
it is to go down into it.

791
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,632
Does that make sense?

792
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:52,169
And that going down into
it is also valuable.

793
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,974
Is no more primitive than enlightenment.

794
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,710
And I think that

795
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,845
that that goes to sort

796
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,848
of the very foundation of the assumption,
which we don't even notice.

797
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,951
It's there about science that everything
is trying to be enlightened.

798
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,354
But that is only partially true.

799
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,222
And I think biology sort of knows that.

800
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,524
But maybe can't speak to it.

801
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,660
That's that's my little piece that.

802
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:25,035
To try to connect that one layer
closer to,

803
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,906
I think, some academic traditions,
but by no mean a

804
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:30,741
normed ones.

805
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,943
But thanks, everybody, for sharing those.

806
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:36,280
It reminds me of the direction taken

807
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,018
in the one of the biographies
I'll paste in the title here.

808
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:45,722
This is Evelyn Fox Keller's
biography of Barbara McClintock

809
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,059
and the title is A Feeling
for the Organism,

810
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,896
and that

811
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:59,102
takes a history
and philosophy of science informed view.

812
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,439
Like What is the feeling
for the organism?

813
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,809
How does one have a feeling
for the chromosomes like this?

814
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,246
Belief that there were jumping genes from

815
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,616
certain psychological observations?

816
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,087
And then how does that really play out
when somebody is in a context

817
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,091
of professionalism and like expectations

818
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,293
around different
people who look different and so on?

819
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,496
So that takes a holistic look.

820
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,799
And I think there is that on

821
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,435
every or

822
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,571
many cases that kind of story to tell.

823
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,508
And so that is one bridge of connection.

824
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:44,982
Blue from like the evolution standpoint.

825
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:50,020
And I think like part of the question
that Steven asked earlier, like,

826
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,091
can we take multiple trajectories,
be it like top down, bottom

827
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,394
up to arrive at the same conclusion

828
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,398
or the same like end point?

829
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:05,135
And this is something like in evolution,
there is like convergent evolution

830
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,604
where, you know, completely different

831
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:12,342
genetically unrelated species
will arrive at the same trait or develop

832
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,879
a very similar appearance that makes
people think like, you know, before

833
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,549
we had DNA relationships like we would
we had species lumped together

834
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,652
because of their similar appearance
that we're actually completely

835
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,757
like unrelated, like we're very distant
on the phylogenetic scale.

836
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,394
So like it's an adaptation

837
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:35,165
that we converge on the same feature
or we converge to the same argument

838
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:39,970
or the same like place
in some kind of space.

839
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:45,075
And this is something that I think
about a lot and just going to like the

840
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:51,014
the quantum perspective, like can we
you know, all go from,

841
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:56,386
you know, point A to point Z,
like traversing a different trajectory.

842
00:50:56,386 --> 00:51:01,024
But like if everything is time reversal,
then that's not really possible.

843
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,393
Like we can't converge to the same point.

844
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,430
Like we have to follow a specific path

845
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:12,436
if time reversibility holds true.

846
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,605
So I had to just like,
throw that in there.

847
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,641
Interesting note.

848
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,743
Let's kind of return to
some of our earlier

849
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,079
frameworks, but

850
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,748
fun stuff, I guess

851
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,385
we knew
we wanted to cover the mark and blanket.

852
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:33,523
We have explored some of the threads

853
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,926
that justify

854
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:41,898
the realest or even further stance,

855
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,635
though we still have a lot of questions
for the last 20 minutes or whatever

856
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,872
about like what leads somebody
and what the implications

857
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,476
are for being different stances, causes
and consequences of different stances.

858
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,244
Why does that matter in general?

859
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,712
Studying crystallography?

860
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:59,282
Why does that matter
for the social setting like decision

861
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,385
making in governance or organization?

862
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,155
That was a justification broadly

863
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,792
for abductions capacity

864
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,928
to be compatible with active inference

865
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,199
and form type
of probably valuable relationship.

866
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,035
Both directions
because active inference gains.

867
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,770
These cognitive features

868
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,940
that were described
before these graphs were invented

869
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,612
analogous to kind of Blue's suggestion
that there was classifications

870
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,748
that were some were really insightful,
others were false competitors

871
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,550
or lump beings or whatever.

872
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,485
Before there was a way
to look at it differently.

873
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,690
That is some
of what grounds a realist interpretation.

874
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,894
So again, we're still not fully closed on
what it means to be realists

875
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,061
or what matters.

876
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,564
But now let's go to the Mark Blanket

877
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,235
in action concept and similarly

878
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:56,206
break down their angle on the blanket

879
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,010
and understand maybe what leads them

880
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,981
and what their suggested implications
are for that stance.

881
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:09,419
What kind of a person do they think
they're being by taking this cognitive

882
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:14,891
social position, which could be asking
both papers and all speech action

883
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,093
and then

884
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,130
where's the beef?

885
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,733
Then what is the

886
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:28,104
what is the between there?

887
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,140
So anyone can go for it.

888
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:37,280
What is something to bring in about

889
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,950
an action blankets

890
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,120
and or how everything

891
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,958
is brought together
in Hippolyta and then us 21

892
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,532
just go take your time.

893
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:59,703
So one of the things that I really like
about this paper is, again, it's

894
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,273
the time it takes

895
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,342
and that that they heavily emphasize

896
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,479
that as part of this code construction

897
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,150
that that enables people
to gain some sense

898
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:19,122
of what it means to be in a now
social situation.

899
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,558
In fact, they they talk about that.

900
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,427
I'm not sure where it is in the paper,
but they talk about the fact

901
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:28,031
that people that are that are

902
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,000
new to a cultural setting,

903
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,302
it requires of them

904
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:37,741
some time in order
for them to be able to pick up on the non

905
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:43,446
linguistic, nonverbal, non
expressed information that's being passed

906
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:48,084
within that social realm
and that they're not picking up on. So,

907
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,889
so what, what enables that and that's

908
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,127
when they spend little bit of time
sort of talking out

909
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,664
why that could only be then considered

910
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:05,535
a co construction
the more you do within that condition,

911
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:10,774
the more you pick up,
you can't simply be watching.

912
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,274
You can't.

913
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,477
It's in fact,
the transition is going from spectator

914
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,280
to the actual doer.

915
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,518
And so that's that's a heavy
that's a heavy burden

916
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,988
to put on the statistics actual

917
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,660
landscape as you don't sort of
sit there and go, okay,

918
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,196
so what's the probability
that this person who

919
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,664
I can't really understand
because I don't what

920
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,633
link don't even know what they're saying

921
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,902
because they're speaking
a different language.

922
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:39,703
What's the problem?

923
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:43,673
A bit like you don't sit there
and kind of do those kind of calculations

924
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:48,478
or maybe you do,
which is just not aware of it, and you're

925
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:52,482
not spending a whole lot of time
with your calculator out

926
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,019
trying to figure out what the what
the distribution is.

927
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,522
While you are trying to co construct

928
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,559
or co coordinate your

929
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,230
your active involvement in this new thing

930
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,333
that you're now trying to be a part of.

931
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:15,872
So that's one of the arguments
that I really like about their paper.

932
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,843
They basically say, in order for this
to work, first thing

933
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:24,581
we have to appreciate
is that there is a temporal commitment

934
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,185
to making anything happen going forward.

935
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,822
You could if you don't have that
temporal commitment, if you check out

936
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,792
before you've even checked in,

937
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,261
nothing changes, nothing happens.

938
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,664
So from a markup blanket standpoint,

939
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,901
that that essentially goes back
to the discrepancy question.

940
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,837
Is it is it is it a hard boundary?

941
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,472
Well, you can perceive it that way.

942
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:53,276
There's this limitation now,
because I don't speak their language

943
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,080
or you can look at it is now what is this

944
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,251
what is this evolving discrepancy
and how does it change?

945
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,519
How does it shift?

946
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,156
How does it do deviate
and then re conform, eventually

947
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,092
oscillating down
to some sort of agreement?

948
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,595
That is the instrumental piece.

949
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,565
I'm just saying most people aren't
sitting there calculating

950
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,835
that out as it's as it's happening.

951
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:22,205
They're basically just trying
to figure out what it's all aiming.

952
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,846
Live want to bring in anything on

953
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,483
and action blankets instrumental ism
and then we can

954
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,921
after that
look at what the inactive writers say.

955
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,197
Think it's been says like in the

956
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:51,034
in the in activists and instrumentalist

957
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,537
blanket perspective I don't know
that's always tends to be like

958
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,876
the classic way that I think about it
but let's let's see what the authors say.

959
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:00,510
All right.

960
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,548
Let's see in the first half
how they set up this question

961
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:10,386
and then we'll end with a fork
in the road that we can discuss.

962
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:11,321
All right.

963
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:15,492
So they start
with similarly defining blanket.

964
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:20,163
We we could look at the word overlap
in the future, but it's scale three tool.

965
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,765
Don't know if Scale Free
was said in the other situation.

966
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,002
It's introduced as a statistical tool

967
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,472
that allows us to interpret

968
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,975
and then again
we see allow for interpreting.

969
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,813
So the language has already conveyed
certain

970
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,183
flexibilities

971
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:42,752
if one is to take a charitable

972
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,955
though narrow reading.

973
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:49,425
So this isn't the only way to read,
but just in terms of how

974
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,696
below
the surface an argument is framed as an

975
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,268
as in addition to the direct rhetoric

976
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,605
immediately moving to the relationship

977
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,641
with the physical boundary

978
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,777
in the abducting case,

979
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:10,613
we saw highlighting of the reality

980
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,583
of the closure of the action
and influence loop.

981
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,453
But there wasn't a justification
of a physical boundary.

982
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,789
And so I do think it is interesting
the earlier discussion

983
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:23,059
with like how does the multi-agent
or like agent based model perspective

984
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,763
as a scientific tool help us model

985
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,033
blurry systems as like

986
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,802
swarms that are a certain resolution
or density away,

987
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,008
then going straight to the first

988
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:43,279
in variant of the Markoff blanket where

989
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:47,617
there are already active and sensory
states rather than introducing it first.

990
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:52,689
In the general case like that, it's about
statistical insulating sets that can

991
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:57,493
then under perhaps some situations
be partitioned to like an incoming

992
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,664
representing sense and then an outgoing
representing action aspect.

993
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:06,302
And so those are the blanket states
sense and action as in a here

994
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:07,370
and then be in there.

995
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,706
Figure one is the box around S and A

996
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,942
and then the ether and the MMU.

997
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,044
They're like
kind of like flips of each other.

998
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,713
I don't think that's the only reason why

999
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,781
they're those letters
and they don't have to be those letters.

1000
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,850
None of them actually
have to be those letters.

1001
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,786
But this is the connectedness, structure

1002
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,691
or sparsity of what
both the authors are describing.

1003
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,561
All right, then here's the fourth.

1004
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,197
It is possible to understand
active in Frozen two ways.

1005
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,401
I think we each had a few ways
of just today,

1006
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:42,438
a real few
that the properties of the models

1007
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,541
should be expected to exist
as an ontological property

1008
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,112
in ontological being like

1009
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,716
not in the use
of using the active inference ontology

1010
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,520
importantly differently enough,

1011
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,822
but rather describing

1012
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,826
the philosophical, ontological
or real basis.

1013
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,697
That's why it's associated with realism.

1014
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,701
Then the second way is the non
realist view that the model is simply

1015
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,336
an instrumental tool.

1016
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:17,974
So we're at the fork of these two

1017
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,943
directions.

1018
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,413
What is the moved in.

1019
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:28,051
My my sense the move is that so

1020
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:33,923
what does that not make up a whole
and I'm not saying that in the title

1021
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:37,093
logical sense
I'm saying if we're actively inferring

1022
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,263
as opposed to looking at a topic

1023
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,733
that's titled active inference, don't

1024
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:49,872
we want to incorporate the entirety,
the complexity or for the sake of

1025
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,610
for the sake of being able to

1026
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,147
to understand

1027
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,783
an action is is active

1028
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:04,921
inference kind of is it a
my question would be

1029
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:09,092
how is active inference actually
being used in each of these papers?

1030
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,829
Is it is it is it

1031
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,899
is it found in the argument
that we don't want to

1032
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,970
get completely complacent
around theory to other minds,

1033
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:26,242
or is it sitting on top of that
kind of the ice and kind of the way

1034
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,680
it can make sure that we don't go
too far off the rails?

1035
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,882
My argument is that it's both.

1036
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,818
If we're actively inferring.

1037
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:40,790
Blue,

1038
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:51,467
any thoughts?

1039
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,070
I don't know. How is active
investing used in each paper?

1040
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,372
I just want to go like look like.

1041
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,575
Like what is the drive home message?

1042
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,412
I mean, maybe that's something that
we can leave for the dot to.

1043
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,817
Wish the graphical abstract.

1044
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,484
Right.

1045
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,820
For all of these strings.

1046
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,023
Well, it is hard to fish stuff
out of the abduction paper

1047
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,058
due to like the lack of figures.

1048
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:23,099
I had to, like, go find my own figures
for the pretty picture.

1049
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,202
Okay, let's look at one layer deeper
at the

1050
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:31,174
the three ways that they suggest that one

1051
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,910
can be a non realist about markup
blankets.

1052
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:40,249
It'd be a whole nother intersection map
with whereas non realist anti-religious

1053
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:44,587
pro instrumentalist just we could do
political compasses all over the map

1054
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:50,126
and there would be even second
level questions

1055
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,795
about how things are defined
and what periods of times.

1056
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,198
And you just it's all good.

1057
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,099
And so we try to

1058
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,036
follow these again.

1059
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,206
I like Dean
the way that you've brought it back

1060
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:07,743
to like navigating in this continuous
space between two ferns,

1061
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:09,979
between two

1062
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,882
at minimum.

1063
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,786
And then that stays in a kind of dynamic

1064
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,389
navigational setting.

1065
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,993
It's then if you're the moth, that's
if you can't go too close to the lantern,

1066
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,162
either lantern.

1067
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,831
If you hit one, then you die.

1068
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,900
So your flight stops there.

1069
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,004
So that, I think,

1070
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,207
puts a very

1071
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,577
meaningful interpretive layer

1072
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,048
because just like I mentioned,
the figures

1073
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:50,253
help with interpretation
and shorter lists help.

1074
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,456
Like there's three reasons
why I'm against this.

1075
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,924
Here they are, one, two and three.

1076
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,960
Those are important structures.

1077
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,329
Yet also,
there's a reason that people don't

1078
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,033
communicate through outlines

1079
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,168
outside of certain situations.

1080
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,206
Okay, say tangent, but what are
the three ways that they're suggesting?

1081
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,209
One can be a non realist about markup
like it's

1082
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,946
what meaning less semantic tools

1083
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,616
this is
going to be I think very interesting

1084
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:24,453
they do not hold semantic value,
interpretive value,

1085
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,757
linguistic or otherwise

1086
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,960
other than that constructed
by using them to understand

1087
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,965
or predict behavior.

1088
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:40,102
In the situation where the scientist is
studying the stop sign,

1089
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,806
they could say
you have the statistical edge

1090
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,945
for me
at mind is being used instrumentally

1091
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,847
and there would be a valid stance,

1092
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:57,053
but especially when we take this semiotic
view which is very similar to semantic

1093
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,589
and they have similar seed,
but the semiotic this

1094
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:05,161
with a stop sign and the actual stopping
and the social and action of stopping

1095
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,929
and the development of the agent
that led to them

1096
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,165
having that belief in that context.

1097
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,970
That isn't just setting it up
in terms of merely propositional logic,

1098
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,907
which we hinted towards in the DOT

1099
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:21,911
zero and many,
many of the peers in the comments dot

1100
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,448
org articles lay it out much deeper.

1101
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,650
But abduction is not

1102
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,486
a static

1103
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,856
set of rules alone.

1104
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,994
The generating selection cycle includes,
at the very least,

1105
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:43,165
structured novelty
arising from internal, external

1106
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:47,003
and everything in between,
and a continuous type

1107
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:51,173
attention distribution
and strategy on attention and so on.

1108
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:56,779
So it's a much richer
setting than potentially semantic,

1109
01:06:56,779 --> 01:07:01,117
which can mean in certain
settings symbolic, which is to say

1110
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,986
the kind of symbolic logic
carried out by like a Turing machine,

1111
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,088
which can still be extensive.

1112
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,991
So even a generous interpretation
is still very

1113
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,627
plausible.

1114
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,165
But there's something different
about semiotics and the bio semiotics

1115
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,667
that was mentioned in the other paper

1116
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,772
that is not one in the same

1117
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,474
as the researchers modeling of.

1118
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,577
And that was also explored

1119
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,181
well by Yellow Bromberg in the 2016
paper.

1120
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,851
The Anticipating Brain
is Not a Scientist, which contrasted

1121
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,320
a scientific analysis modality

1122
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:43,659
with the cognitive system
as cognizant and distinguishing

1123
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:47,763
cognitive science in a way from that
through ecological psychology. The

1124
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,200
Yeah, I was just going to tag on to that.

1125
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,372
I think in order for this to happen,
I think in theory it's easy to say

1126
01:07:57,706 --> 01:08:00,209
we don't place a waiting on our priors

1127
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,445
by simply doing.

1128
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,513
I remain objective
throughout all of this,

1129
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,783
but I don't think that most of us,
even when we take that

1130
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:12,054
really strict scientific stance,

1131
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:16,592
are aware of the priorities
and the weights that we have.

1132
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,662
Even subconsciously apply.

1133
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:24,900
So again, I think I think you can say

1134
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,371
there's no there's no value add to this.

1135
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:34,477
I'm just I'm just I remove myself from it
and I'm just a passive observer of it.

1136
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:39,215
But I'm not sure how
how long we remain passive

1137
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:43,352
before we start applying weights
and values to what it is that we're

1138
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:45,721
we're

1139
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,023
analyzing especially in a situation,

1140
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,861
especially in situational analyzes

1141
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,531
that are personal
and the consequences fall back on.

1142
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,635
So now if you're simply watching
something and there is no consequence

1143
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,472
upon you as the observer,
maybe that's easier to do.

1144
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,543
But if you get to a place where
the scientist part of the experiment,

1145
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:12,681
wow, show me how that
that switch gets turned off

1146
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:16,352
and you don't place
a waiting on something.

1147
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,055
Very powerful and true.

1148
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,626
And in many ways,
implicitly and explicitly,

1149
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,096
the kind of messaging sometimes

1150
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,465
that I see in the information environment

1151
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,003
is about getting people
to update their priors, to believe

1152
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,974
that they're included in a larger,
which is an absolutely valid

1153
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,745
communication and perspective

1154
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,314
and the how of the path

1155
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,751
and the homeostasis
and the multilevel system

1156
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:52,821
and the critical path it has to follow,

1157
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:56,258
including reflexivity
and narrative and anticipation.

1158
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,461
And this bottom up, top down aspect,

1159
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,798
it's that is social and action.

1160
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:03,933
Like people can argue

1161
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,468
that there's different social structures
and different settings

1162
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,571
and it doesn't have to be a top bottom.

1163
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,472
It doesn't have to be any specific

1164
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,743
metaphor or cycle psychoanalytic
like lens, basically.

1165
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,247
But the one shortcut

1166
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,250
to collapsing all of that complexity

1167
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,453
into a data point,

1168
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:29,158
the this one trick is to approach it
like an experiment

1169
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,761
because that is
what the experiment is in a way

1170
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,464
it is about finding a manifold
where it's like

1171
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:40,836
this tube has this strand of DNA
and this set of things,

1172
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:44,373
and then that allows the
the paint on the wall

1173
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,776
and all these other factors of the true
context

1174
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,713
to be isolated from.

1175
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,781
That's
kind of like the partial information

1176
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:56,151
encapsulation
or just any other type of system.

1177
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,221
And then potentially
we see like with Quantum.

1178
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,925
Yes, some persistent anomalies

1179
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,829
that suggested
things were not always as they seemed.

1180
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,633
However, the real case

1181
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:15,271
study is not the quantum mechanics,
but it's the Bayesian mechanics.

1182
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:20,209
With the psychological study
and the neuroimaging study

1183
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:24,780
and the behavioral study by all kinds of

1184
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:30,819
people in all social and action settings.

1185
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:34,890
And that really does point towards
some of the deeper

1186
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,559
implications of interaction is

1187
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,430
formal modeling of social

1188
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,966
and cognitive systems.

1189
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,168
One could

1190
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,505
step out of that real life

1191
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,408
and enter into another

1192
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:56,412
and and situate themself
from like a third person perspective

1193
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,850
and look back onto this single path plane

1194
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,987
and see that as an experimenter.

1195
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:10,526
And that is in many ways
associated with metacognition.

1196
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,228
However, can that observer

1197
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,865
claim realism versus instrumental ism?

1198
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,469
What where people
speaking in terms of that view,

1199
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,471
I don't know.

1200
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,573
Just bringing up
that sort of like, are you,

1201
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,443
where are you?

1202
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,310
And that really relates

1203
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,213
to the self-concept of Blue brought up
and like the kind of

1204
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,683
situating this with the self-concept
and then realist instrumentalist.

1205
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,852
But let's move on through these points.

1206
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,888
Second reason why one could be a non
realist of America blankets.

1207
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,258
One could merely

1208
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:47,463
view them as valuable fictions.

1209
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,297
Yes. Okay.

1210
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,833
That allow abstracting
certain features of phenomena.

1211
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,002
But a valuable fiction

1212
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,672
one could ask
are all of the generated interpretation?

1213
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,041
Is fictions valuable or not?

1214
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,644
Or so does saying it's a fiction

1215
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,481
and saying everything is a fiction

1216
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,782
is that

1217
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:09,451
in what ways

1218
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,421
is that instrumental or in
what ways is that realists

1219
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,656
making a real claim
that that is the stuff

1220
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,961
which all things are, though
it's not of the stuff

1221
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:23,432
that potentially somebody was taught
about atoms in a certain classroom.

1222
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,736
So the persistent divergence
can some to think that one of those

1223
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,572
is scientifically grounded
and another is metaphysically grounded

1224
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,877
and or open to preference, faith or other

1225
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,848
perhaps preferences
and concerns entering that discussion.

1226
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:41,950
And then

1227
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,287
the third one is,

1228
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,823
you could be a non realist
about moral blankets

1229
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,560
because just because it's

1230
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,896
the success
of the use of the moral blanket

1231
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:58,066
justifies, the acceptance
of the epistemic value of the model

1232
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,204
without necessarily
making ontological claims,

1233
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:07,943
in other words,
just because the physical model

1234
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:11,680
is fitting well doesn't
mean it's really an AP cycle.

1235
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,349
Just because the circular orbit models
fitting well.

1236
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,150
How well?

1237
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,420
99% until somebody comes along and goes

1238
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,890
99.9 with a
totally different model structure.

1239
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,461
So it's kind of like saying how

1240
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,162
how sure could you be

1241
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:30,599
about a realist interpretation
of the structure of the model

1242
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,870
when as part of one's commitment
to the scientific,

1243
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:39,041
they might leave the door open
to some future model

1244
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:42,778
with higher explanatory
predictive power design and control, etc.

1245
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:43,579
Then.

1246
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,348
Yeah, that's
and I don't know where it is in the

1247
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,585
we actually had it
because I was looking at the slides

1248
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:53,021
from the 47 zero this morning
and there's a there's a part that's

1249
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:57,426
highlighted in the other paper, the talks
where Peirce says, leave the door open.

1250
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,528
That's what addiction is about.

1251
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,797
It's simply the door is ajar.

1252
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,300
You don't have the certainty,
but you have enough of you have enough

1253
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,370
information to make

1254
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,873
a hypothesis,

1255
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:16,211
not an explanation to best or not
something rather to best explanation.

1256
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:20,482
But you can
now you now have something to move off

1257
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:24,052
to to leverage off.

1258
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,054
And that's
because the door was left open.

1259
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,590
So again, you can come at it from

1260
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,692
you can come at this conclusion

1261
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,061
that the third one,
the success of the Markoff blanket

1262
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,830
through the instrumentalist lens.

1263
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,000
But there's people on the realist side
that are saying the same thing.

1264
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,904
The more open, the more likely
it is that you'll actually

1265
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:49,311
get to the specifics sooner.

1266
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,948
Here's a fun at example analogy

1267
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:57,119
to kind of bring it back to Stephen's
earlier request.

1268
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,522
There's a faster is slower
or slower is faster.

1269
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,991
One can just imagine both ways.

1270
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:07,362
But the empirical finding in ants
is that during certain escape

1271
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,432
evacuation situations like

1272
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,569
leaving a room
where alarm pheromone has been spread,

1273
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,406
that when there's like
a constriction in the exits.

1274
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,209
So the morphology of the nest
that they've constructed

1275
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:26,181
when there's a constriction
that situation in car traffic

1276
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:29,885
jams and in people
crowd situations can be very deadly

1277
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,956
and that can be associated
with like a crush situation

1278
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:39,895
or a liquid too solid, like jammed in
and then a fracture

1279
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:43,765
which can have all kinds of issues
on the center of where it happens.

1280
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:48,870
Whereas in the ants they slowed down
their individual movements.

1281
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,807
So it wasn't like some orderly queue.

1282
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:56,078
Everybody get in line and now we're going
to wait for number so-and-so be called.

1283
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,212
This was like

1284
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,849
their response in the situation

1285
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,919
to the bio semiotics

1286
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,822
and the niche construction of escape.

1287
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,223
Right.

1288
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:13,028
Was a slower is faster response
such that yes

1289
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:16,765
their morphology as ness mates helps them
like by having legs that are wide out.

1290
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,002
They're physically insulating.

1291
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:23,739
So it's not to say that
that is the single thing for a human

1292
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,642
to semantically keep in mind
in a physical escape setting.

1293
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,179
But active inference lets us pull back

1294
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,949
to those different settings

1295
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,621
and at the ants
and their view from the inside the end of

1296
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:43,325
so meiosis like the pheromones perception
in the neurobiology of the nest mate.

1297
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,495
And then there's the exothermic

1298
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,597
with the scientist,

1299
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,799
and then there are

1300
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,871
instruments in play. DIN

1301
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,307
So you're not thinking through

1302
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:03,345
amped minds that would be to
M instead of teaching more.

1303
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:07,182
However, there is a sense

1304
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:11,586
that there is
there is a hive mind at work,

1305
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:17,492
even though you cannot necessarily
share that hot hive mind.

1306
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:21,363
There is no blending,
there is an autonomy.

1307
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:26,301
And there is a sense
that if if I am a believer

1308
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,704
in the top down version, which

1309
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,541
is enabled by an activism,

1310
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:38,647
if I'm a believer in that,
I can also understand without thinking

1311
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,250
through the mind of a realist,
what that realist

1312
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,387
perspective is.

1313
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,989
So you're not weird?

1314
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:52,794
I would say that what Thomas and Inez
wrote

1315
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,898
from that, from a logical standpoint
makes a lot of sense,

1316
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,902
but that doesn't disqualify from my

1317
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,072
my thinking and, this other way

1318
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,075
of thinking from coexisting

1319
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:11,012
and and and having
I don't think I don't know the answer.

1320
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,849
Watching Daniel or not, maybe they are.

1321
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:17,385
I mean, maybe there's another narrative
that Daniel will share with us about

1322
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,955
when the ants became aware of him.

1323
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,823
But I'll just tell you a quick story.

1324
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:24,159
I feed Magpie.

1325
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,530
I think Corbett's
and what the of realized is it's me

1326
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:31,867
because they're very quick
to recognize faces

1327
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,737
and what they do is they return the favor

1328
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,874
I get I get little little

1329
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:41,910
I get bones

1330
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:45,614
from from from dead things
that they've eaten.

1331
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:49,951
I get the bones
set on the same rock that I place the

1332
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:54,890
the dog food on because they love this
this fish flavor, dog food.

1333
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,059
They actually return things
and contribute back

1334
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,363
because they want me to continue
that cycle.

1335
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:05,901
So I don't know if ants do that, but
I do know I do know that other species,

1336
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:10,138
whether they would describe it
as knowing my mind,

1337
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,841
certainly want to influence my behavior

1338
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:19,581
from a strategy standpoint.

1339
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,950
Awesome lot of points there.

1340
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,687
So that's in contrast with a framework

1341
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:29,324
like Panpsychism
or like the absence of psych ism.

1342
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,327
So just totally putting aside
many of those questions

1343
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:38,667
you describe like a pan
intentional stance ism, a pan strategic

1344
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,770
AM that allows for complex

1345
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,272
hollow violence, blue's microbiome

1346
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:49,578
as well as the human dog
supply chain Crow setting,

1347
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:54,883
allowing
for those to exist and be modeled

1348
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:58,386
by like decision making and control
theory, game theory, etc.

1349
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,524
because of the pragmatism of the game.

1350
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,660
It is like a doorway

1351
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:10,999
into considering all these situations
as something to play, some games

1352
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:15,937
to signal through, some games to win
in this way or to have this outcome.

1353
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,374
So that's pretty interesting. Then

1354
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:25,513
there's thinking through other species,
that's a very interesting idea

1355
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:29,584
and be cool to design experiences
like games or art

1356
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,487
that could allow
for different kinds of communication.

1357
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:38,226
And then on the point in the objective
paper about the economy of science,

1358
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:41,897
which we can return to that discussion
of Pearson's concept,

1359
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,901
it's like thinking
through reviewers minds.

1360
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,937
And so just seeing also facets

1361
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,306
or thinking through my chess opponent's
mind.

1362
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,942
It's not a total emulation

1363
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,612
but note, but being able

1364
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:01,316
to generate interfaces,
affordances, policies.

1365
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,153
There's so much in a partial information

1366
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:10,091
situation that the entity has generate
and the generation

1367
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:13,561
scope means that there has to be
a strong selection mechanism too.

1368
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:16,831
And those are the cycles of

1369
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,302
temporal objective logic

1370
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:25,407
which breaks us out of the inductive

1371
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:29,010
deductive, static, conceptual

1372
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,180
dialectic.

1373
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:36,851
And this brings pragmatism, action,
ecological psychology and so on.

1374
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:41,256
So it's really fascinating
to see what is flowing

1375
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:45,360
within that space of formal models

1376
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,998
of perception, cognition and action,
which are thousands of years old.

1377
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:54,502
And it will be important to understand
so many of these different threads

1378
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,539
because they're not all quantitative.

1379
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:01,676
And the abductor of paper and the social
and active paper are demonstrating

1380
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,379
two of the most important areas
where that's the case.

1381
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:05,747
Then.

1382
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,882
Yeah, I just want to real quick on that.

1383
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:12,187
So it wouldn't matter if I decided that
I wanted to do a situational analysis

1384
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:18,893
and based that on the very real gifting,
gifting size going on,

1385
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,730
or at least I'm interpreting it
as a gifting exercise,

1386
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,798
that would be one approach
that I could take.

1387
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,401
The other approach I could take
would be a very instrumentalist one

1388
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,169
in terms of token exchange.

1389
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,006
Either one of those things

1390
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,174
would work, putting them together

1391
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,844
like might

1392
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,513
be even more addictive.

1393
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,547
I'm not sure.

1394
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:41,583
I don't think it would be confusing.

1395
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,184
I think it would just

1396
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,755
provide two lenses on the same

1397
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,558
on the same process.

1398
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,429
Looking at

1399
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,599
I have to lead on that as is figure
two and three.

1400
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,836
So here is a perspective

1401
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,272
on social construction

1402
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:08,443
that they're pulling from non in activist

1403
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:11,980
or non active inference perspectives.

1404
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,750
The difference with Figure
three is the social action, and figure

1405
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:20,989
two under the active inference
framework is the coupling.

1406
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:25,427
And so there doesn't seem like
there be even one kind of thing

1407
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:31,399
that would be captured by this gray box
in the middle of Figure three.

1408
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:36,304
So play it safe.

1409
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:41,776
Take an instrumentalist perspective
on this gray box.

1410
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:46,448
It's one
very important node in interpretation

1411
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,651
and then pass that through the tubes

1412
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,620
to the objective reviewer

1413
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,657
who looks at it and says yes.

1414
01:24:55,657 --> 01:25:01,563
And the social actors are engaging
in objective logic.

1415
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:05,300
My background in Peirce suggests
that abduction,

1416
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,671
primacy of the generation selection
and the time dynamics

1417
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,174
and the flow of action
with the environment

1418
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,543
from Pearce's work abduction

1419
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:20,548
can be interpreted
in a realist framework.

1420
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:23,952
So this can be held instrumentally
with this

1421
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,123
view, with this I

1422
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,292
and one can then ask
whether the abduction

1423
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,430
that you're modeling it
doing objective logic

1424
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,967
may even be able
to hold an instrumental stance.

1425
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,604
But Is it instrumental
for the social actor

1426
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,107
for the end of semiotics
instead of from the Exo

1427
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:50,378
Symbiosis Blue?

1428
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:52,347
So you kind of took the words
right out of my mouth there.

1429
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,348
Good job.

1430
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:59,687
So, like, is this gray box,
this sociocultural meanings, model

1431
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:04,792
based reasoning,
like can those be subsumed under

1432
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:11,065
CMOs?

1433
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:13,101
Are you asking can it be a filter?

1434
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,137
Like is excessive meiosis

1435
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:21,876
like the imputation of such sociocultural
meanings and model based reasoning

1436
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,979
is that extra symbiosis.

1437
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,686
From the definitions
that I've seen in the usages I've seen it

1438
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:36,691
XO means from the outside and means
insight in general in scientific words.

1439
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,094
So meiosis is the meaning
construction process.

1440
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:45,600
So exo
symbiosis is a view from the outside.

1441
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,770
For example,
looking at that stop sign situation

1442
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,440
unfolds, looking at that aunt pheromones
situation unfold.

1443
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:58,112
Whereas the end dose of meiosis,
the interpretive semiotic process

1444
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:04,619
by which something comes
to have an internal meaning,

1445
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:07,655
which then could be asked
whether it's in a symbolic or a cognitive

1446
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,657
or an intentioned way
and all these different aspects.

1447
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:16,464
But I hope that that's an accurate
distinction.

1448
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:21,669
You actually are you are you trying
to make this simple for my little brain?

1449
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:26,874
Are you asking whether not a person
can take a third person perspective?

1450
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:31,412
So I'm just trying to understand, like

1451
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:37,485
the symbiosis is very clear to me, but

1452
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:42,857
but like this exo symbiosis,
like when I like look it up, right?

1453
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:44,792
Right. Like so,

1454
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,429
Anderson,
meiosis is like the signal transmission

1455
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:51,933
into the interior
that's like and those symbiosis like the

1456
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:57,805
right like the interpretation of science
into the inside.

1457
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,942
But like this exo
symbiosis is like between

1458
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,445
organisms, like the silent

1459
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:08,916
and signal transmission
between organisms of the same species

1460
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,320
or of different species, like,
for example, the thermal.

1461
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,690
Like that's what I read as exo symbiosis.

1462
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:19,260
So when you look at that figure
three like

1463
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,297
is that not exo symbiosis?

1464
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:27,168
I mean it looks model representation
and what was the other thing in there?

1465
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,203
So looking for the.

1466
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:31,539
Here's

1467
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:34,909
a fun view I think on the exo
so yes I think we're in agreement here

1468
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:37,779
and the symbiosis is like the signaling
within the organism

1469
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:39,347
or the view from the inside.

1470
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:43,818
But that right there is the heart of also
the boundary as a physical versus

1471
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,520
boundary as a functional. So

1472
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:47,755
there's a whole

1473
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:51,092
complexity with bio semiotics,
which is usually I think why people talk

1474
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:54,962
about the bio semiotics
and just recognize the complexity

1475
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:58,166
rather than take a stance
too early on that partitioning.

1476
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,868
But then this one is the axis
and like perspective

1477
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:07,442
constructing messages
to alleged extraterrestrials.

1478
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:08,576
So if we look who.

1479
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:11,045
Are the others,
who are the authors of that paper.

1480
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,148
They're listed here. Douglas A coach.

1481
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:15,583
But yeah.

1482
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,250
Let's

1483
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,154
well so

1484
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:23,825
so just this like sociocultural
meaning imputation

1485
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:26,894
and like in the mean paper
that Daniel and I

1486
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,731
just put out and in

1487
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,767
with RJ and Rachel

1488
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,203
the semiotic representation

1489
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:39,374
is culturally like relative.

1490
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,777
I mean, like, there's no a stop sign
that isn't going to be a stop sign

1491
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:48,416
to like someone in like the aboriginal
like very like native primitive

1492
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,852
like lifestyle, right.

1493
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:53,287
And so

1494
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:55,189
the this exo exo

1495
01:29:55,189 --> 01:30:00,161
semiotic is like a transmission
between organisms of the same species,

1496
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:03,731
but like also like the same culture
I would say.

1497
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:08,169
Because like how do you you can't like
and even I don't know if that's true.

1498
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:12,407
And pheromones, like if segments of
different species mean different things,

1499
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,742
like the same pheromones
can have more than one meaning.

1500
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:18,880
Is that also true or the same,
like kind of molecular compounds.

1501
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,718
I mean,
I think we probably don't know enough.

1502
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,820
I think I think I understand
what you're asking now.

1503
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:30,758
Is there
is there an assumed sense that there

1504
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:35,596
they're some some type of form
of entanglement has to be present

1505
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:40,201
for any of that
to make sense to make sense

1506
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:46,240
implies that something has existed
that didn't maybe exist

1507
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,978
in the in that in the distant past.

1508
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,347
It wouldn't exist in a different context.

1509
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:57,251
So so that's
why the socio cultural meanings like,

1510
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,288
like I think of that as like exo exo
some exists.

1511
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:02,590
Like you.

1512
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,261
I mean kind of goes

1513
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:09,397
without saying that there's just
different

1514
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,301
closeness is along different axis

1515
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:16,404
like people
who are speaking the same language

1516
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,806
but different vocabularies or

1517
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:23,110
you know, the situation matter
so much the body language

1518
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:26,747
then, the more distal or different

1519
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:30,151
the cognitive structure is

1520
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,487
relative to what it becomes

1521
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,323
harder to, quote,
put yourself in their shoes

1522
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:37,892
and so on.

1523
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,761
And I feel like that's a

1524
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:43,564
question with the multi scale system
phenomena is

1525
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,534
whether they're dissipative
or persistence,

1526
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,605
diverse intelligences, understanding

1527
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:54,108
what the water we swim in
is cognitively and linguistically

1528
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,211
because the water we swim in,

1529
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,781
some of it is going to be the signal

1530
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,784
or something else.

1531
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:05,887
It could be the influence signal,

1532
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:09,624
like the B matrix in active influencing

1533
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:13,094
causal relationships in the world
as part of the water you swim in.

1534
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:16,998
It also could be like modifications
through stigma, e.g.

1535
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:20,134
niche modification,
like your physical influences,

1536
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,137
which might be the water you swim
in, in the sense you don't notice them.

1537
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:28,175
Like many things that come out of and
through us, we don't direct awareness of.

1538
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:33,581
So they're like the paint on the walls
in that PCR experiment.

1539
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:37,852
It's amplifying the DNA because
it's the parts that, whether we like it

1540
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:42,390
or not, they get condensed down
to a dot or a path

1541
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:45,560
and then that becomes, ah, like sense

1542
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,663
making from local partial information,

1543
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:53,301
as if a lot of the invisible part
we could just disregard.

1544
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:57,171
And we do cognitively like we talked
about like the exhaust heat with Chris

1545
01:32:57,171 --> 01:33:01,108
Fields in quantum like you have to burn
information to pay attention

1546
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:05,079
and and you have to pay attention
to deal with a real complex niche.

1547
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:08,482
So there's a lot of tensions

1548
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,286
in that path and

1549
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:14,522
especially with

1550
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,558
this dyad
and I'm sure so much other related work.

1551
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:21,829
But with this dyad
and I think with the lens that Dean,

1552
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:24,565
you helped approach it to with

1553
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:30,171
it is putting some of those

1554
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:33,841
threads into a different light,

1555
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:36,978
and especially for those who

1556
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,081
in this semiotic way

1557
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:44,885
add some Bayesian surprise,
some cognitive state updating

1558
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:49,590
from any number of different things.

1559
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:51,959
That's like proof of concept

1560
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,363
social in action,

1561
01:33:55,363 --> 01:34:00,534
but not in a corroded
or in a performance art.

1562
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:04,739
Although who would say
it's not performance art but still way

1563
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:08,309
that brings the realism into the social
through the formal

1564
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:11,345
and doors.

1565
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,748
Dean And then blue.

1566
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:17,084
I think, I think I see
both of these papers as pillars.

1567
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:20,254
I see them as really stabilizing
for different reasons.

1568
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,823
And I would rather stand
on both of my feet

1569
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,627
and have something stable under
both of them than try to stand on one

1570
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:30,131
or both these standing on one cylinder.

1571
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:34,435
Because I find that I find that
just based on my more and more difficult.

1572
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:36,570
But as

1573
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:39,540
as we tried to
take up this new season of live streams

1574
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,277
and bringing two things together
that felt like a frontier moment.

1575
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,013
And I think that one of the things that

1576
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:50,084
I hope we have conveyed is that

1577
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:54,388
looking at two things
at once is by nature

1578
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:57,458
more complicated,
not necessarily complex.

1579
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:00,094
The complexity exists
in each of the papers.

1580
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:03,931
But two, to look at two things
at once is more complicated

1581
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:08,436
and therefore is more fraught
with the error of the trial and error

1582
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,805
relationship.

1583
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,941
I'm not saying that
we made it much mistakes, but I think

1584
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:16,944
the first

1585
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:19,413
the first rule of generation is

1586
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:22,316
you won't get it right

1587
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,151
right away.

1588
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:27,955
You will have to again
have that temporal commitment

1589
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:30,991
in order to be able to get
wherever the heck you think you're going.

1590
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:35,196
And I didn't really know where this
was going to go other than

1591
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:36,597
I wonder

1592
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:40,801
what happens if
we don't narrow our regime of attention

1593
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:44,672
and necessarily know we were widening it.

1594
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:49,477
But I did know at some point
we might get the authors

1595
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:53,781
coming on and asking us, asking us

1596
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,383
why these two.

1597
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:59,086
I don't think it has to necessarily
be these two papers.

1598
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,355
It's just that both of these papers

1599
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:06,193
create and create a nice symphony, right?

1600
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:11,031
So it could be any set of papers.

1601
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:14,502
It takes a chocolatier
or a wine connoisseur

1602
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:17,171
to really make the pairing special.

1603
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,741
Yet there's other situations

1604
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:23,611
where any pairing can be
potentially fruitful and insightful.

1605
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:27,114
Like, sometimes I think about that
in a community context.

1606
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:31,118
Like you're always going to share between
zero and one context, and wherever

1607
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,421
you are on that continuum, the parts
where you're sharing is awesome.

1608
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:35,489
In the parts where you're different.

1609
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:39,393
We can also respect as great
or the overlap between two papers.

1610
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:43,964
Well, the word used was opposite or
it was like contrary in some other way.

1611
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:47,368
Okay. And then with a stance.

1612
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,270
So then I thought of

1613
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:53,507
the kind of like games where people have
to stand on a single pole

1614
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:55,442
in a, in a

1615
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:58,712
tropical, beautiful location
and try not to fall.

1616
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:02,016
So I thought when you have both feet,
like you said on one position

1617
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:04,084
narrow

1618
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:06,821
then Buffetts of wind

1619
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:10,291
are assaults on your equilibrium
steady state,

1620
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:13,861
especially when it's like
which one of these one person

1621
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:16,864
is going to be a professor
just as an example.

1622
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:20,401
So why not resist

1623
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:24,138
and return to a fixed mode?

1624
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:27,374
Because that's like sort of the mode
seeking that we heard about

1625
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:30,311
in some of Dalton
and Maxwell's recent work.

1626
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:35,015
The fixed mode is the center of gravity.

1627
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:38,652
And then another way
that you describe with I kind of having

1628
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,489
like a nonzero divergence
and the space between

1629
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:46,427
is like in basketball
the triple threat stance

1630
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:49,630
because you could dribble
or pass or shoot

1631
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,167
by like going for the basket.

1632
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,269
And yeah, that's a different stance.

1633
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:59,306
And it's also in a field of affordances.

1634
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:01,609
So it's not just
that they're in a different position.

1635
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:04,945
Like the feet here are not much
wider than the feet here,

1636
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:07,348
but this is

1637
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:11,986
the invest
again mood, as Peirce would have

1638
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,390
maybe alluded to it, that in a context

1639
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:21,095
with an action, ecological psychology,
all of that in a context

1640
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:24,965
with an instrument and a game

1641
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:29,403
and something outside
the game that supported the game.

1642
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:33,674
All those levels
are in the triple threat.

1643
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:35,676
But how did I get here?

1644
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,779
Why am I on the green one

1645
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:41,882
is a limited context and

1646
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:46,820
I still think that.

1647
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,422
Yes, it's still highly skilled.

1648
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:53,127
Nobody's questioning how how much energy
is being poured into doing that.

1649
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:56,063
And that's that's hard work.

1650
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:58,499
And there's a huge reward for doing it
well.

1651
01:38:59,066 --> 01:38:59,967
And there's many.

1652
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:02,870
And so I totally agree.

1653
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:06,640
And even intend that people
could have trained a lot for this one.

1654
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,243
This could be someone who doesn't
play basketball.

1655
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:12,346
And so that's why it has to be
a little dynamic and situational, but

1656
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:16,450
just seeing them as kind of like
extreme modes of paper interpretation

1657
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:20,387
in an extended paper
interpretive metaphor,

1658
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:25,492
one could see
different modes of receiving

1659
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:30,331
some meiosis
from literature or discourse.

1660
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:33,901
And then what is the role
of participation

1661
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:35,903
and feedback.

1662
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:40,641
And then that multi-agent setting
that we mentioned,

1663
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:44,545
I hope that's not too random

1664
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:46,680
in our last.

1665
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,283
Yeah blue go for it.

1666
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:54,755
So one like pairing of papers
that I would have liked to have done

1667
01:39:55,022 --> 01:40:01,161
is this objective reasoning paper
with the Chris Fields quantum paper,

1668
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:03,263
the one from the 40

1669
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:07,134
like because I was just reminded of it so
much as I was reading through the paper

1670
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:11,005
and just like learning about objective
reasoning and what does that look like

1671
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:16,276
and how like we, you know, in objective
you don't have complete information.

1672
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:18,479
It's like partially observable.
And so like

1673
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:22,082
you just make your best prediction
from like a partial observation.

1674
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:25,652
And it made me think of like the quantum
reference frames

1675
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,590
where you don't like it, like you can't

1676
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:33,761
get full overlap with someone else's
quantum preference frame.

1677
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:35,095
Like, like it's not

1678
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:38,432
like even with perfect learning,
there's still going to be some noise

1679
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:44,171
or some overlap between the quantum
reference or some incongruence. The

1680
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:47,808
quantum reference frames, some area
that's not overlapping.

1681
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:50,911
So, so I don't know,
I just those two things

1682
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,448
that's like one pairing
that I would have liked to see.

1683
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:58,419
That's that's really interesting.

1684
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:02,056
Like as alluded to earlier, the quantum

1685
01:41:04,825 --> 01:41:07,361
broke the glass

1686
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:12,032
on the reflexivity question
in philosophy of science.

1687
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:16,203
I hope that's not to overstated to say
and it wasn't

1688
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,173
the only piece in the building
or the weakening of the glass,

1689
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:23,343
but the earlier mentioned persists.

1690
01:41:23,343 --> 01:41:26,880
An anomaly regarding experimental context

1691
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:31,185
expanded the scope of certain questions
in science

1692
01:41:31,718 --> 01:41:35,789
beyond discourse
in certain cultural circles

1693
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:39,693
during the last like 500 years
that Stephen alluded to parts of

1694
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:43,730
so quantum is where

1695
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:49,636
abductee of temporal relationality
it's there when you see it now,

1696
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:54,541
it's not proto active particle of the
electron or just a pebble.

1697
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:57,544
This wouldn't be happening.

1698
01:41:57,544 --> 01:42:00,848
Or if the electron were a pebble
that were bigger,

1699
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:02,015
this wouldn't be happening.

1700
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:03,317
But would it not be

1701
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:06,520
or would it not be happening
because we could measure it better?

1702
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:10,491
All of those questions about points

1703
01:42:10,491 --> 01:42:13,894
and particles and waves

1704
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:16,930
under Bayesian mechanics

1705
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,466
as a mechanics for cognitive

1706
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:23,370
particles, the reflexivity

1707
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:27,508
now can flow in
not just from electron scale,

1708
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:30,577
but I feel like there are multiple

1709
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:33,981
contact surfaces with reflexivity

1710
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:37,117
at the semiotic

1711
01:42:37,117 --> 01:42:39,786
narrative ecological.

1712
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,923
The real scales

1713
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,558
outside of the experiment.

1714
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:47,461
And I think that is what partially
speaks to

1715
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:52,833
the way that we entered this dot
one discussion.

1716
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,736
So in our last

1717
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:59,439
five or 10 minutes, what would we like to

1718
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:03,677
have or note
talked to just to the authors

1719
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:06,613
if they listened to this in the time
between or not?

1720
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,983
We're looking forward
to talking to anybody who wants to,

1721
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:13,787
whether it's for the DOT
to or any point in the future.

1722
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:16,089
There's always a dot three avoidance.

1723
01:43:16,089 --> 01:43:20,060
So we hope to continue this discussion
with those who have authored

1724
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:23,063
and those who have not not yet authored,

1725
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:27,100
because there's so much
to build on, on on this vector.

1726
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,870
So both of you don't feel free
to as long as you would like,

1727
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,373
just mention any points
that you want to discuss for next week.

1728
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:40,847
Dean had brought up earlier.

1729
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,182
Like where?

1730
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:43,417
Where is active in France?

1731
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:44,151
Is it is it

1732
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:48,722
the basis is it like resting on top of
is there some kind of duality there?

1733
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:52,092
I think that's something
that I would like to kind of look back

1734
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:55,562
at each paper and and figure out,
like where I where, I want to put

1735
01:43:56,797 --> 01:43:59,499
active inference in that pillar
or on that pillar.

1736
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,236
Or is it the pillar?

1737
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,136
I don't know.

1738
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:04,371
Yeah.

1739
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:08,809
Are we going to be able to go with
our active inference colored highlighter

1740
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:13,714
and say okay these two words yet
or you know this clause.

1741
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:16,550
Yep, this paragraph

1742
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:21,221
with this paper or
this interaction of the paper, this tool

1743
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:25,359
developed by the paper,
where would one be to highlight

1744
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:32,132
how I saw the paper?

1745
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:35,569
And I know
Stephen would completely agree with you.

1746
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:40,207
Can I just get you to put behind where
in brackets when is active inference?

1747
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:43,677
Because
again, I think that matters so much

1748
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:47,381
about inductive logic and rest reduction.

1749
01:44:48,048 --> 01:44:51,285
The other thing is, is that I,

1750
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:53,720
I hope that that lose

1751
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:58,125
thinking about well, what,

1752
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,194
what if we pulled other papers
and entangled them.

1753
01:45:01,194 --> 01:45:02,696
What what might that.

1754
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:04,998
I hope that's an opening.

1755
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:06,867
I will say this

1756
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:10,170
it takes incredible
amount of preparation.

1757
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:16,310
If all two papers together
and not do the proper respect

1758
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:21,214
for the amount of work that the authors,
the originators of that work have done.

1759
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:25,952
So whatever the whatever the preparation
is in terms of quantifying it

1760
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:28,789
for a single paper to it justice,

1761
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,992
it's many multiples of that
to two papers.

1762
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:35,829
But I think if we are going to be active
and first

1763
01:45:36,196 --> 01:45:39,299
not just subject matter
experts on activity trends,

1764
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:43,937
that that exercise is difficult
and is time consuming as it is.

1765
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,840
It literally,

1766
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,210
literally changes that game
because we talked about the game here

1767
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:54,314
quite a bit today, which again,
I didn't think that was going to come up,

1768
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:57,250
but thank goodness, did

1769
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,186
because it's not oppositional.

1770
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:02,155
The game can be
everybody gets in the canoe

1771
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:05,859
and works together
to arrive at Hawaiian Islands.

1772
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:09,062
That can literally,
literally be the game.

1773
01:46:09,062 --> 01:46:09,396
Right?

1774
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:11,898
It doesn't have to be a competition.

1775
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:12,966
It's not a race.

1776
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:15,802
It's do we survive

1777
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:17,371
given the limited amount

1778
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:20,340
of information that we need to glean here

1779
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:26,980
as as as important to our are our
we are ability to continue on.

1780
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:29,883
I think that's
what being an active employer is.

1781
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:33,053
That's where we shift
from a subject matter expert

1782
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,454
to a prediction matter expert.

1783
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:36,490
Actually transitions.

1784
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:39,926
So I want to thank people again for

1785
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:43,864
what feels like hanging yourself
out there in a real risky way

1786
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,134
because it is risky if that's

1787
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:51,204
what it is.

1788
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:54,474
Thanks again. There's so much to say.

1789
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:59,646
I hope that it's an honor
and a privilege to be in epistemic spaces

1790
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:02,482
and have one's

1791
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:05,285
homeostatic variables secured.

1792
01:47:05,719 --> 01:47:07,921
So that opens up an amazing

1793
01:47:08,355 --> 01:47:10,991
space and approach.

1794
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:13,460
The temporal aspect of abduction

1795
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:17,731
sounds so great to return to
because I think another

1796
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:21,935
one of those points of contact
communication is the dynamic.

1797
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:26,072
What were the only formal isms
in either paper in terms

1798
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:29,543
of like equations
and mathematical symbols?

1799
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:32,612
It was three representations
of dynamical systems

1800
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:37,083
of happily
to invent s to connect and ground

1801
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:41,021
a contact point
from where they were taking a stance and

1802
01:47:41,054 --> 01:47:47,394
and a skilled performance into the
mathematical symbolic scientific.

1803
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,763
Someone says this paper
is a philosophy paper.

1804
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:51,698
Yes, but it has equations.

1805
01:47:51,698 --> 01:47:54,901
So that is going to come
to be something different.

1806
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:56,970
And then

1807
01:47:57,704 --> 01:48:00,106
you start reading a paper,
change the game.

1808
01:48:00,106 --> 01:48:05,445
But reading multiple papers
changes the game and it is in a way true.

1809
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:08,381
It is more

1810
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:12,085
rides to keep in mind because

1811
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,455
at least under some norms

1812
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:17,624
and preferences for paper discussions

1813
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,827
like personally I prefer

1814
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:24,297
and find myself at home
when people don't extensively speak

1815
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:29,069
from what a person thought
and take the end semiotic perspective

1816
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:32,973
from them or from like a whole culture
which seems implausible to me,

1817
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:38,044
but situates the semiotics of themself

1818
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:44,150
in relationship
with a non-trivial and a symbiosis.

1819
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:48,388
And where do those two threads meet?

1820
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:51,491
The blanket, which is in

1821
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:54,027
potentially its most elegant course
screening

1822
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:58,632
represented by the gray box here.

1823
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:03,370
And why would we want to delimit
or even grip?

1824
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:07,541
Maybe the gripper that we
have at this point are like

1825
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:10,310
car pliers

1826
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:12,579
and this is something very different

1827
01:49:13,713 --> 01:49:16,683
and or something active.

1828
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:19,819
So at this or any point in time.

1829
01:49:19,819 --> 01:49:23,623
It seems absolutely valid
to look at the structure of Figure

1830
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:27,661
two and three and hold so many stances

1831
01:49:28,695 --> 01:49:32,132
at once or in rapid navigation.

1832
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:35,101
So wow, what a fun discussion.

1833
01:49:36,236 --> 01:49:38,538
Thanks,
Steven, for joining and Blue and Dean.

1834
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:44,844
And we will look forward to some
interesting times in the data and beyond.

1835
01:49:45,145 --> 01:50:16,643
So peace out.
