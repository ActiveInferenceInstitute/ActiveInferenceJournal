00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
it is august 3rd 2022

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
welcome to the active inference

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,239
institute

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
we are a participatory online lab and

10
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
institute that is communicating learning

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,280
and practicing applied active inference

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,039
you can find us at some of the links on

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,320
the slide

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,680
this is a recorded and an archived and

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
transcribed and published live

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
so please provide us with feedback

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
so we can improve our work

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,080
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
welcome and we'll be following video

etiquette for live streams

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
all active inference institute

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,200
activities are participatory so do let

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
us know if you want to contribute or get

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,600
involved head over to

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,960
activeinference.org and click the links

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,799
to participate directly and to learn

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
more

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,600
well

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,119
we are about to set off on a

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,560
odd-numbered

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
and unique adventure in 47.

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
we're going to be discussing and

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
juxtaposing not one paper as per usual

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
but have a multiple eyes open approach

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
towards two papers in this situation

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
we're going to be learning and

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
discussing

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
in a juxtaposed fashion two papers

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,439
active inference and abduction in 2021

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,439
by ati vaiko

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
pieteren and majid beni

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
also we'll be discussing an active

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
dynamic social cognition and active

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
inference by ines hippolyto and thomas

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,758
van s also from 2021

46
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,038
all videos

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
dot zeros and otherwise are

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
introductions to these ideas and

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
additional context not a review or

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
evaluation or final word

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
and we are going to

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,680
consistently we hope use this coloration

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
of a light red for the abductive paper

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
and a light blue for the inactive

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
leaving the space open for new colors

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
and combinations to arise that

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
demonstrate some areas of synthesis

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,519
and we're gonna talk in this dot zero

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
with some big questions and go over our

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
aims as well as reading in between those

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
aims which is a little bit different

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,599
than many live streams

63
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
we're then going to provide

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
overview information on each paper in

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
terms of aims the claims the roadmap and

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,239
the abstract

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
we'll then move to a background in

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
context section

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
that will include a lot of information

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,280
on inaction semiotics abductive logic

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
and so on

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
we'll then move into a juxtaposition of

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
the two papers

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
and we're going to have a lot of time to

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,440
discuss with hopefully multiple authors

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
in the upcoming

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,760
discussions.1.2 and maybe beyond so

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
today we wanted to bring a big picture

79
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
context

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,120
talk about some very interesting threads

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,799
provide a little bit of background that

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
helps one enter into this space and then

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
provide an initial juxtaposition and run

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
through these papers that again will

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,120
just get somebody excited to read the

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
papers dive in more deeply and bring

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
their own perspective to bear on these

88
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
very interesting topics

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,560
so

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,959
we'll move to the introductions

91
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
california

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
and i'll talk more about what's exciting

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
in the coming slides i'll pass it to

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
dean

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
uh good morning my name is dean i'm in

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,879
calgary and uh i guess i was

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
maybe the the warped mind that tried to

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
put this idea together and maybe

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
change a little bit the way that we look

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
at active inference by trying to pull

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
two different papers of seeming

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
seemingly

104
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
different folk focuses

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
and then

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
both of those also

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
incorporating the use of active

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
inferences as a methodology

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
to situationally analyze and so what are

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
the implications for that

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,919
so i find that really kind of exciting

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,280
and i'll pass it over to stephen

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
so thank you dean yes stephen here i'm

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,040
in um toronto canada um

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
and i'm really

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
interested about both of these papers

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
because

118
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
they both speak a lot to kind of

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
participatory

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
approaches in general and the idea of

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
how people are engaging in the world

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,560
um so the the questions around

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
um inaction

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
is is really relevant as is the

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
abduction piece so

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,320
um

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
while they're both quite different

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
papers the they're both

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
speaking

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
uh to me quite strongly so that's really

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
interesting so i'm looking forward to

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
being able to

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
sort of explore that i'm i'm i work with

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,199
uh participatory theater

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
community psychology community

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
development and multi-scale

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
development processes and i'm really

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
excited to

139
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
to just see how

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
this scientific take

141
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
can meet a more

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,639
what might be called a practice-based

143
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,160
participatory question that i've been

144
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
looking at so i'll pass it back to

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
daniel

146
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
excellent thank you both and dean thanks

147
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
again for the many month

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
journey

149
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
the many email and month

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
and message journey that we've walked

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
because i i do hope this will

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
unfold and include in a way that is

153
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,360
taking the live streams

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
and the kind of materials that we're

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
working through beyond where we have

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
gone

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
and

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
in

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
spirit of that i will pass the dean to

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,440
introduce some of the big questions here

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,479
well

162
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,840
if you're gonna pull two papers that

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,199
don't seem to have

164
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,880
a heck of a lot in common in terms of

165
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
their subject matter you're gonna have

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
to come at it from a little bit of a

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
different angle in terms of not just

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
ferreting out what's within a paper but

169
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
how those papers might be

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
compared so we pulled together some some

171
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
questions around the idea

172
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,919
of what role as a situational analysis

173
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,520
either tool or

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
reality method active inference might

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
play in

176
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,479
pulling things that seem to be a long

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,199
ways away and apart and entangle them

178
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
and so the questions were basically can

179
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
active inference be both

180
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
something that holds or contains or

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
bounds something and also be the thing

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
bounded or being gripped what is active

183
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
inference or if what if active emphasis

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
both the thing

185
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,080
being contained

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
um say a partitioner line in a table

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
and a cell

188
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
so that the actual gap that we can

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,160
actually put more information into what

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
that look like what it would look like

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,960
both as a constraint and a separator

192
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
simultaneously and i think it's that

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,599
mutuality piece that we're going to try

194
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
to tease out in the next few live

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
streams and what is similar or different

196
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,879
in getting a grip

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,080
on models and a different process which

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
is modeling

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
thank you steven do you want to add

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
anything here

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
no i think that

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
that covers a lot of it the only thing

203
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
that that x that's there is is sort of

204
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,400
denoting

205
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
you know can active inference models

206
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,919
modeling

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,240
um frameworks so this this this

208
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,080
contextualization of the term um sort of

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
comes into play but we're going to talk

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
about that a bit later so yeah thanks

211
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
awesome and

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
this is

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,800
one of potentially the first our aims

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
slides because

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,039
it is hopefully going to help to come

216
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,520
back to this level

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
the meme

218
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
here represents this live stream

219
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
bringing together

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
the two papers in a way where we've had

221
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,120
one hand clapping

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,760
now we're gonna bring that together into

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
two you can hear the sound coming out of

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
the live stream already especially if

225
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
you're listening

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
dean what would you describe about r

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
ames or how would you

228
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
um summarize oh and one other note i'll

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
add about rna ames is we want it to be

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
comprehensive but also to have videos

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
that are listenable and of reasonable

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
temporal duration so there will be many

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
slides that will have a lot of text

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
copied out of the paper and will merely

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
note pause the video if you'd like to

236
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
read but we're just going to move on

237
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
from many of the text slides we just

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
really wanted to make sure that all the

239
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
text was there invisible but we're not

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
going to read everything so

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
please dean uh summarize what of these

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
aims you'd like to

243
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
talk about you know i'm just going to

244
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,160
talk about the sort of the the

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
the root of each one of these bullets

246
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
which is take a closer look at the

247
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,440
realism instrument instrumentalism

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,760
debate i don't have to go into what that

249
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
is if you've been a participant in it

250
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
you know what we're describing

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
uh reinforce a two eyes open approach

252
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
where one eye takes in the pair of

253
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
active inference papers the inactive

254
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
dynamic social condition

255
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
and abduction while the other man if the

256
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
other eye manifests active inferences

257
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
as an integrator of both

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
because we think that it actually can do

259
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
that without blending

260
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
it can actually cause a weave or a braid

261
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
and then the third bullet is make

262
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
explicit the absolute necessity if we're

263
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,279
going to do those first two things of

264
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
understanding the temporal depth of

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,079
models that would actually

266
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,440
incorporate

267
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
two papers of seeming distant

268
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
topics as we make active inference into

269
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,920
two different subjects

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
and then just what we did is pulled out

271
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
different um

272
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
things that the authors noted about

273
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
their papers

274
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
thank you and stephen if you could carry

275
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
forth with reading in between those aims

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,519
or adding anything you'd like from this

277
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
slide

278
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
yeah thanks daniel so

279
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
you know one set of authors says you

280
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
know is really looking at

281
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
instrumentalism

282
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
and you know you know it's a valid

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
scientific perspective but you know

284
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
there is there then describes you know

285
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,480
this question about the road towards

286
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
um

287
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
realism

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
and normalism so

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,079
you know where

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
the idea is that in

291
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
one paper that instrumentalism is is is

292
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
the way to sort of

293
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,959
capture or to

294
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
to sort of hold ourselves in this

295
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
scientific work

296
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,360
well that can be challenged um

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
and we would we would see ways that we

298
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,800
might need to

299
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
to loosen that when we get into

300
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
participatory approaches so something in

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,680
between which loosens that scientific

302
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
space and is a practice space so the

303
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
same with the second point

304
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,560
um

305
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
where okay is is instrumentalism

306
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,040
um you know the way forward so what what

307
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
constitutes

308
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
behaviors when living in a niche what

309
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
constitutes living beings

310
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,519
um and how do we resolve

311
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
which way forward so if there's if there

312
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,480
are contradictions

313
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
should we reconcile them if we're in a

314
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,560
team trying to use this

315
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,480
um should we just live with them and

316
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
just move forward

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
um or where should we actually highlight

318
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
them so this is in a way trying to think

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,000
in a um outside of maybe this sort of

320
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
laser focus

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
on the scientific

322
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
philosophical point and saying okay when

323
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
we're trying to bring these into a team

324
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
context

325
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
should we would we loosen some of that

326
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,519
so

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
and so just it just mentions here to

328
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
give an application should we then also

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,839
think about

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
active imprints being prefaced or

331
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
suffixed you know adaptive active

332
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
influence effective active influence or

333
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
active inference modeling

334
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
you know is how important is that

335
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,360
clarification to then

336
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
also think about how the instrumentalism

337
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
realism piece might be utilized in in

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
these other ways

339
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
do we need to position um

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
you know fully in one fully on another

341
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,240
and if we're in between

342
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,519
you know

343
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
can there be greater or lesser access to

344
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
knowing based on the context so often in

345
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
participatory work

346
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
different types of practices you know

347
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,360
the context is key

348
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
and then this sort of speaks a little

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
bit to my own idea of the co-creative

350
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
work and i know that um

351
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
you know daniel's very much with teams

352
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
and

353
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
deans very much with transformation you

354
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,959
know often there there's a co-creation

355
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,880
piece there's a there's a bit where you

356
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
you want to support the butterfly

357
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,519
without crushing it there's something

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
quite delicate there

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
so how can we

360
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
at times

361
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,079
bring this into spaces where it's it's a

362
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,320
co-creative space you know where there's

363
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
modeling happening in a more subtle

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,440
contextual way

365
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
and

366
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
while we have these

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,079
scientific definitions and strategic

368
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,560
designs and hard analysis

369
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,839
and they're useful we don't want them to

370
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,519
crush um what's happening

371
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,720
and there's a couple of pictures there

372
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
that

373
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
sort of speak to that and i'll pass it

374
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,880
over to dean maybe and you can speak to

375
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,480
the sampling

376
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
of waters in between and the mind the

377
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
gap

378
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
well i i think i think

379
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
that was a beautiful explanation and i

380
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,720
think

381
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
when if and when the authors are able to

382
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,959
come on that'll be something that we'll

383
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
now be able to put some color to i think

384
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,279
we've i think we put some anchors in the

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
ground but we haven't said how much

386
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
how much flow

387
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,320
can go between those different nodes and

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
that's what i think we wanted to

389
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
establish right here is the betweenness

390
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
lots of times

391
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
like it says mind the gap that's the

392
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,040
only thing that can kill you at the

393
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,079
subway

394
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,600
all right because you're not paying

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
attention to the gap and i think the

396
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,079
sampling of the waters in between does

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,160
the same thing except it provides a

398
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,360
little different

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,839
subtle difference in terms of the

400
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,000
fluidity of those kinds of gaps so i

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
think it would be really interesting if

402
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,120
we if we use that as our portal into how

403
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
we might bring things together and

404
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
make them

405
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
dance when they otherwise would be

406
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,560
sitting on chairs on the opposite side

407
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,160
of the room that might be an interesting

408
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
conversation to start in the dot one and

409
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
two

410
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,720
thank you both and the only comment i'll

411
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,839
add here is

412
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,320
this discussion we've been having on the

413
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
adjectives that preface

414
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,199
the adaptive affective etc active

415
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,320
inference

416
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
and then also stephen the focus you've

417
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
brought to the suffix that x and

418
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
brackets

419
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
active inference model as one instance

420
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
or case or realization

421
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
active inference framework active

422
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
inference process theory what what

423
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
follows and this really reminds me of

424
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
left branching and right branching

425
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
clauses in grammar and syntax

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
and that there's a base clause

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,759
what is our base clause and then what

428
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,800
branches before during and after i think

429
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
there's a very rich space and i really

430
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,040
like these embodied

431
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,639
and flux based metaphors that help us

432
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,600
understand um

433
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
so much so

434
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
into the paper overviews

435
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
this will just be some metadata and

436
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,160
descriptions on the papers before we

437
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
pull back to the background in context

438
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
and then move forward into the papers

439
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
running through their main points

440
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
so we're not going to read the abstracts

441
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,639
they're both

442
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,040
of course available for these papers

443
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
here is the abstract for active

444
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
inference and abduction

445
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
here's the abstract for inactive dynamic

446
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,839
social cognition and active inference

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
here are the keywords for both of these

448
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
papers the inactive paper

449
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,079
has the keywords social cognition niche

450
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,279
construction

451
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
active inference theory of mind and

452
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
activism and dynamical systems theory

453
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
the abduction paper has the key words

454
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
abduction active inference free energy

455
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,320
principle first and blanket

456
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,559
triadic relations and pierce

457
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,520
let's go to the aims of

458
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,359
and the claims of

459
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,520
the abduction paper

460
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,559
so

461
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,559
dean would you like to cover

462
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
any of the aims of the abduction paper

463
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,599
what i would like to do is just sort of

464
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,119
foretell what

465
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,839
both of both papers want to aim at and

466
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
that is you'll see a key word in the

467
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
second bullet of this one which is

468
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
alliance and then there are words that

469
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
you're going to see in the other paper

470
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
where they're again saying

471
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
we want things to come together

472
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
but we want to be careful on how we

473
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
describe that coming together we don't

474
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
want it to be perceived metaphorically

475
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,880
as a blending as an undoing of

476
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
two two or more things that we believe

477
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
have an associative

478
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
um relationship and so i think when

479
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,160
you're going through the aims of the two

480
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,640
papers if you if you kind of step back a

481
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
little bit you'll see that the authors

482
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,600
of both papers are are

483
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
doing a hard ex explanation on what

484
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
relationship

485
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
they want us to pay attention to and so

486
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
that's something that they both papers

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
share it's a heavy emphasis on

488
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
relationship

489
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
great point and they both are very

490
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
richly and powerfully written

491
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
and here we see alliance and allegiance

492
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
and certainly there's going to be a lot

493
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
of discussion in both the papers about

494
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
integrating disparate or partially

495
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,799
related ontologies and vocabulary sets

496
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
and different thinkers different threads

497
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,880
of intellectual development

498
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,799
these quotes from the paper can be read

499
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
and of course are expanded upon in the

500
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,440
paper

501
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
but as dean said this paper's focus is

502
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
on the intellectual alliance

503
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
between active inference and free energy

504
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
principle fep and primarily the work of

505
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
cs pierce

506
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
in terms of semiotics pragmatics

507
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
grammaticism abductive logic that is the

508
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
aim synthesis is bringing those two

509
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
together in a way that's synergistic and

510
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
and is providing meaning stephen

511
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
yeah and just following on from what

512
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
you're saying the both these papers and

513
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
particularly the abductive one

514
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
it gives a way to look at

515
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
areas that are really hard to

516
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
simulate for computers um and

517
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
the the way that abduction happens or

518
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
particularly with humans is

519
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
very sophisticated and i think

520
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,200
it's really helpful to then see

521
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
semiotics which is actually used a lot

522
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,080
in

523
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
theater sonography and set design

524
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,760
um pragmatism so brought into this with

525
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,160
a with a with a really

526
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,799
a theory that's you know transcends

527
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
science often right is often used in

528
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
other fields like

529
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
the natural sciences has some use for it

530
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,799
but it's often used in the humanities so

531
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,760
i think

532
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,360
this is speaking to that piece about

533
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
what is it that

534
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,440
is revealed that kind of secret sauce

535
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
that kind of hit in the soul which is

536
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
normally missing and in action

537
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
there's also something that's like that

538
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
awesome

539
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,200
claims of the paper

540
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
are throughout the paper but just to

541
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,000
highlight some of the key claims

542
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,159
they're claiming that that aim that they

543
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,520
set out to make

544
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,080
between the work of active inference and

545
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
the abduction and semiotic perspective

546
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,720
appears they're claiming that that is

547
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
feasible and that they're providing an

548
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
initial sketch for it

549
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
in this theoretical theoretical

550
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
integration

551
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
of the new and the old

552
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
something red something blue something

553
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
new something old

554
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
and the two frameworks the new and the

555
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,919
old respectively

556
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
are the modern instantiations of

557
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
neuroscience and cognitive science

558
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
represented by a free energy principle

559
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
and on the old a historically accurate

560
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
and precise interpretation of abductive

561
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,679
inference including the importance of

562
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
the economy of research all things that

563
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
we're going to come back to just wanted

564
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
to clarify the claims there can i just

565
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,720
add one yes please

566
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
real quick so theoretical integration

567
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,200
there i mean from what if you can think

568
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
back to when we were talking about our

569
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,840
aims

570
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,760
now the question is this is what the

571
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
authors are saying

572
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
what we're wondering is does that make

573
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
active inference both the integration

574
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
product and the integrator the process

575
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
and again i want to i want to kind of

576
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
tease back that one step because i think

577
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,039
that's going to happen again when we

578
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
look at the other paper

579
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
they'll use different nomenclature but

580
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
they're going to say the same thing and

581
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,520
again

582
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,320
it's it's hard to see the commonalities

583
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,159
unless you and you don't have to make

584
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,280
them up

585
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
you just have to

586
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
notice them in in

587
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
the two different types of forests

588
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,559
and a point on that they're

589
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,559
both in a way using active inference as

590
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
an integrator as well as a

591
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
differentiator we're making an

592
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,240
integrated model of internal and

593
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
external and blanket states

594
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
by differentiating them and then of

595
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
course integration and differentiation

596
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
also have a joint

597
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
usage in mathematics with the integral

598
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
and the derivative notation so there's

599
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,840
going to be a lot of things coming

600
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,880
together um

601
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,559
steven's your hands still up yes please

602
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
yeah just one thing as well i think this

603
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,320
is really helpful to talk about

604
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
neuroscience in this computational

605
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,679
neuroscience and to highlight that

606
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,200
because i think

607
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
something that

608
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
is the reality in the world out there

609
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
the culture out there where

610
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,919
where these ideas are circulating is

611
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,919
that neuroscience

612
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
is turned on its head basically by

613
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
active influence

614
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
neuroscience as a field

615
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
as people understand it

616
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,919
is

617
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,840
some sort of

618
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
deductive

619
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
process of stuff coming in and then

620
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
being evaluated and

621
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
concretized as opposed to this

622
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
predictive journey so i think it's

623
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
really really useful

624
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
because this is this is something that

625
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
we all face and i think what i also have

626
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,240
noted when i've spoken to some

627
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
neuroscientists is they've actually had

628
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,200
like an existential crisis and shifted

629
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
partly often by coming up with inactive

630
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
claims and seeing really if inactive

631
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,960
claims are there how can their work with

632
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,039
neuroscience be

633
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
so held together so

634
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
there's this there's there's a piece

635
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
here that relates to the general and and

636
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,279
that that general

637
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,679
piece is is more important

638
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,400
when we start to bring um

639
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,559
active influence out from

640
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
the specialist areas where it's kind of

641
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,799
enclaved and its rules of the game are

642
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,559
known and you're into the areas where

643
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,159
people say neuroscience well i know what

644
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,679
that means

645
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,600
and off you go so thanks great thank you

646
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
the paper has relatively few sections

647
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
it has an introduction

648
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
it then presents a

649
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,600
a pairing

650
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
of active inference in the light of

651
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,559
abduction

652
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,240
abduction in the light of active

653
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,279
inference

654
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
slightly oblique reference to nothing in

655
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
biology makes sense except in the light

656
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,760
of evolution or except in the light of

657
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,960
something and these are two lights

658
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
back to that islands what is the space

659
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
between

660
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
and then there's a discussion

661
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
on the economy of research and its free

662
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
energy naturalization and the conclusion

663
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,640
and the pierce rabbit holes run deep

664
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
we're going to go into a few soon

665
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,240
on to the inactive paper

666
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
so here we're going to be describing the

667
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,960
ames claims and roadmap of the inactive

668
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
dynamic social cognition and active

669
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,279
inference paper

670
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,240
the paper presents a two-fold aim

671
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
to dissect new accounts

672
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,559
that blend in activism with inferential

673
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,960
accounts and explain why doing so

674
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
involves contradiction

675
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
is the first aim

676
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,559
and the second aim is to offer

677
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,400
the only reasonable account linking in

678
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
activism and inferential accounts

679
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
especially on this case of social

680
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,480
cognition

681
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,200
so

682
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,840
yes please no guess what i was hoping

683
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
could you now turn the word linking

684
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,960
purple for us

685
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,120
yes

686
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
thank you

687
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
yes

688
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
we have different ways of describing the

689
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,159
between that stephen did a lovely job of

690
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
of emphasizing before we actually

691
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
started looking at the um

692
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,039
the papers themselves

693
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
yeah it's in between yeah

694
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,000
it's awesome and it is actually

695
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
through your request and the slides

696
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,360
platform it becomes an active dynamic

697
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,760
social stigmargic

698
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,200
and so

699
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
that's a proof of concept for what

700
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
but this is the aims of this paper okay

701
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,120
they also have many claims

702
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
articulated throughout the discussion

703
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
and they actually use some very clear

704
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
notation to describe the specific claims

705
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
from other work and from their own work

706
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
and about which claims and hypotheses

707
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,720
have which logical relationship

708
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,520
um

709
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
they're going to make claims about the

710
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
nature of cognition and its embodied

711
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,360
basis

712
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
they're going to be discussing some of

713
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,840
the claims related to the human social

714
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
cognitive niche

715
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,360
and talking about the importance of

716
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,440
relationship enculturation niche

717
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
construction

718
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
and then they're going to be talking

719
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,440
about theory of mind tom

720
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,520
and about the compatibility or

721
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
contradictions

722
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
associated with linking

723
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
inactive

724
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
claims with

725
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,799
theory of mind or inferential accounts

726
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
the paper's

727
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,279
roadmap lays out many of these aims and

728
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
claims quite clearly they begin with an

729
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
introduction

730
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,120
and introduce a

731
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,600
recent though influential work in the

732
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
active inference field which is the

733
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
thinking through other minds framework

734
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,240
ttom

735
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,320
and they as they say dissect this

736
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,279
account

737
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
to try to tease apart the way that in

738
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,559
their view

739
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,880
the inactive and the inferential counts

740
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
were brought together

741
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,240
they also have a figure describing a

742
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
markov blanket which is going to be a

743
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
concept that plays keely in both of

744
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,279
their papers

745
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,279
section 2 something's got to give

746
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,360
rejecting inactive inference through

747
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,799
other minds

748
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,480
they're going to utilize two assumptions

749
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
namely that social cognition reduces to

750
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,720
mental representation and two that

751
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,520
social cognition is hardwired from birth

752
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
and they're going to disagree with both

753
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,440
of these assumptions and in their

754
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
opposition to these assumptions

755
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,320
supported by subclaims and evidence

756
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
that is going to lead them to their

757
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
broader conclusions

758
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
they're going to use dynamical systems

759
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,039
theory

760
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
and talk about how dst

761
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,960
can be linked with an activism in terms

762
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,640
of its compatibility and what these two

763
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
frameworks offer each other within an

764
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
instrumentalist reading

765
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,559
and then they're going to discuss active

766
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,600
inference specifically in the context of

767
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,159
dynamical systems theory on one hand and

768
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
inactive

769
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
cognition social cognition on the other

770
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,080
hand that's the inactive dynamic

771
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
hyphenation

772
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
they'll describe with a few figures

773
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,520
about similarities and differences

774
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,159
between social inaction generally as

775
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,760
conceptualized outside of active

776
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,039
inference and then they're going to

777
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,679
introduce visually how active inference

778
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,200
enriches that picture

779
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,799
and then they have a very interesting

780
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
table distinguishing between or amongst

781
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
phenomena observed in the natural world

782
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
and observed behavior in the natural

783
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,399
world

784
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,520
okay

785
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
awesome to run through the papers that

786
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,399
way

787
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,360
now

788
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
let us move to the background in context

789
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,559
section so in this section of the dot

790
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,520
zero

791
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
we're going to

792
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,120
use some quotes from the paper for sure

793
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
but we're also going to pull a step back

794
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
and demonstrate just the tip of the

795
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
iceberg of the scholarship and the

796
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
research that we carried out leading up

797
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
to this point

798
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
hopefully to excite

799
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
the listener or reader

800
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,360
and to provide some context into these

801
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,159
very deep threads that are going to be

802
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,840
approached and approximated in the

803
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
papers

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
i'll provide a first note here or dean

805
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
please go for it

806
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,640
just i guess i think this is a

807
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
spectacular moment to say

808
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
okay so

809
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
background and context so we're talking

810
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,200
maybe

811
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
the temporal and the physical

812
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,799
setting

813
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,559
so that's now something that we can

814
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,799
situationally analyze

815
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,080
and again

816
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
it doesn't matter whether you use active

817
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
inference or whether you use a cast

818
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
model or whether you use

819
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
professional initiatives programming

820
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,760
bottom line is everybody is trying to

821
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
figure out

822
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,840
what the situation is

823
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
through an analysis method and and and

824
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,760
i would imagine that every one of those

825
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,799
methods

826
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,240
has a greater or lesser viability

827
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,960
depending upon what the situation both

828
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
temporally and physically is

829
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,039
so i i think

830
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,039
that's the critical things we're not

831
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
saying that each of these papers

832
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
are good or bad

833
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
we're saying that each of these papers

834
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,440
has a focus on a different

835
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
background context combination minimum

836
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,120
of two so now if we pull the two things

837
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,840
together we can't say

838
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
that that it's going to be the same

839
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
thing that we're going to come up with

840
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
that our aims as people who have now

841
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,159
looked at the two papers side by each

842
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,520
that's going to create a whole new

843
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
entity

844
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
thank you

845
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
to lead off this background and

846
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,640
contextualizing section i wanted to

847
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
invoke one of my favorite artisan poets

848
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,679
william blake

849
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,919
and blake wrote

850
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,559
contraries are positives a negation is

851
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,399
not a contrary

852
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,279
negations are not contraries contraries

853
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
mutually exist

854
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,279
but negations exist not

855
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,440
exceptions and objections and unbeliefs

856
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
exist not nor shall they ever be

857
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,880
organized forever and ever

858
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,440
end quote

859
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,399
contraries in this blakeyan

860
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,960
fourfold logical framework

861
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,240
in fact

862
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,039
are part of a dialectic and they exist

863
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,120
as a function of each other like convex

864
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
and concave or like gravity and

865
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
radiation as buckminster fuller might

866
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,440
take it towards

867
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
and so negations in this poetical

868
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,519
framework

869
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,120
are those which

870
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,720
exist not

871
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,000
whereas a and b can be on the contrary

872
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,679
whereas a and not a have a different

873
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,080
logical relationship and this kind of

874
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
four-fold logical approach

875
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,440
to recognizing the state space and the

876
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,480
truth claims that multiple juxtaposed

877
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,320
assertions can have with

878
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,679
amongst each other

879
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
is also foresaged in a lot of world

880
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,679
knowledge traditions

881
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,480
um for example the kata scotty

882
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,640
and this is a logical

883
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,559
tool and method that's been applied for

884
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,440
a very long time in the uh the dharmic

885
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
traditions of the indian context

886
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,960
wanted to provide that and also um

887
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,640
with these images which either of you

888
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,399
are welcome to explore

889
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
what does one hand clapping or a person

890
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,279
doing the splits

891
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,120
have to do with contradiction and

892
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
negation

893
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
yes dean yeah

894
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,679
regarding contradiction as well and i

895
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,559
think this

896
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,320
points to

897
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,519
the the kind of the contextual piece

898
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,720
um

899
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,399
the situational

900
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,320
uh analysis piece

901
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,519
is

902
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,240
there's there's the situation

903
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
inside which

904
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,240
there's there's there's the

905
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
contradictions are constructed if that

906
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
makes sense

907
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,320
um and that's also embodied and enacted

908
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
through our life so it might well be

909
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,360
as a baby we you know

910
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
the the morphology of the child at

911
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,360
different

912
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,559
stages in different contexts gives the

913
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,760
ways

914
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,559
to

915
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,039
establish situational

916
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,240
awareness

917
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
and the contradictions within that

918
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,760
as things become codified so you've got

919
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,039
these these

920
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,880
these situational

921
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,799
um

922
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,440
processes are kind of um are what we're

923
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,159
doing in this ongoing modeling flow the

924
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,039
kind of the fields of practice

925
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,840
in these different papers that underpin

926
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,159
them the inactivist feels a practice or

927
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,320
the um the more computational fields of

928
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,000
practice they've they're what we kind of

929
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,960
embody and we get into and we learn

930
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
and that's what we're kind of

931
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,480
intuitively modeling in a way we get a

932
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,960
feel for how we should model being

933
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,359
in these situations the contradictions

934
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,119
but that modelling

935
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
often and this is the danger

936
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,839
when it gets

937
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,399
overpowered by someone with their model

938
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,359
i.e

939
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,359
someone's in their world modeling what

940
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
it's like to be themselves or trying to

941
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,079
process it they go and see a counsellor

942
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,639
with their model and that model

943
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,119
is being used to fit them to the model

944
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,839
and then that counselor will tell us

945
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,480
what their problem is how it's framed so

946
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
i think this model model in

947
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,960
um is

948
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
quite relevant here because you know

949
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,040
once these contradictions are

950
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
established it might well be that

951
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
there's a model created within that

952
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,599
domain

953
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,918
and then someone who's not necessarily

954
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,520
in that domain

955
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,240
can

956
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
be ascribed to the model they don't know

957
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,960
what the game is they're not in the

958
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,599
process and the model takes over so that

959
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,040
sort of switches over to the splits

960
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,800
because then okay we've got two things

961
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
they're together

962
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
we we're talking about this yes let's

963
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,560
you open up and you've got a stance

964
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
okay so i'm slightly and at some point

965
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
it's like that's not a stance brother

966
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
that's that's a split you've got into

967
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
there you're going to have to be careful

968
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
right so you've gone into this idea that

969
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
you're opening things up now were they

970
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,440
one thing to start with were they a

971
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,640
stance that they were held in some ways

972
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,520
have they split in a in in a way where

973
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,960
they're now

974
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,520
isolated from each other you know i

975
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,119
suppose we're trying to hopefully find a

976
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,400
way to neither push them into one

977
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
neither having split maybe have a stance

978
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,240
in between

979
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,480
that is um somehow agile and uh

980
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
relates in this case to realism and

981
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,680
instrumentalism that kind of echoes some

982
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,280
broader themes

983
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,640
thank you dean

984
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
just real quick um a lot of people have

985
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
heard the yogi baronism of when you see

986
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
a fork in the road

987
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,880
take it and i know that with the with a

988
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
lot of the term joint

989
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
has come up a lot joint probability for

990
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,960
example and so the idea of split here

991
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,640
is a really good one for metaphorically

992
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,160
speaking because

993
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,440
if you are

994
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,640
looking at something with active

995
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,119
interference and you are assuming that

996
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,000
in a tea maze experiment you have to go

997
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,880
left or right well human beings

998
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,280
can see a fork in the road and take it

999
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,000
that's kind of the standing joke

1000
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,119
if you see a fork in my legs take them

1001
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
don't necessarily

1002
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,000
you have to choose a orbee you can take

1003
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,079
the whole thing and i think that's what

1004
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,040
blake is trying to point at with this

1005
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,680
exercise and so is that a contradiction

1006
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
no if i see utensil on the road i can

1007
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,160
take it but if i'm not open

1008
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,839
to the idea that fork doesn't only mean

1009
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
left or right

1010
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,320
then i'm already self-limited in terms

1011
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
of what i am testing what i'm

1012
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,280
situationally analyzed

1013
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,079
thank you both all right into the more

1014
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,800
direct keyword pieces

1015
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
so in action from thisdefinitions.net

1016
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
site an action is one of the possible

1017
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
ways of organizing knowledge and the

1018
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,240
forms of interaction with the world

1019
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
inactive knowledge is knowledge that

1020
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
comes through action and is constructed

1021
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
on motor skills such as manipulating

1022
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,480
objects riding a bicycle or playing a

1023
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,800
sport that's just one of many

1024
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
definitions that have been provided

1025
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
we've also had several live streams and

1026
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
paper discussions on an action in active

1027
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,760
inference

1028
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
for example

1029
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
in active live stream number six

1030
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
way back when in 2020 we discussed

1031
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,599
ramstead at all a tale of two densities

1032
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,920
active inference is an active inference

1033
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,839
in

1034
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,680
2021 we discussed a paper also of

1035
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,000
hippolyto at all embodied skillful

1036
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,560
performance where the action is

1037
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
and interestingly

1038
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,240
for saging in some ways this very

1039
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,640
discussion here's a slide from

1040
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
that live stream um

1041
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
with uh of the hippolyto paper

1042
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
and here we had the piercing

1043
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,920
uh triad and we had the symbolism and

1044
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,040
this the semiotics and the references to

1045
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
french

1046
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
so we actually were talking about the

1047
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
very related concept of representation

1048
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
and indeed those who support

1049
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,040
and or reject and or find contradiction

1050
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
and linkage all of the above

1051
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,839
the discussion around

1052
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,680
inactivism and the inferential account

1053
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,000
is going to hinge very much on the

1054
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,240
question of representation and cognitive

1055
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,119
representations what those are where or

1056
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,920
if they exist and so on

1057
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,480
um that was livestream 23.

1058
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,520
also from this paper of sangati at all

1059
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,359
uh they lay out just visually we're

1060
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,760
gonna see more representations soon

1061
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
in their view

1062
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,400
some of the distinctions between

1063
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,480
traditional social cognition

1064
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,640
and inactive social cognition

1065
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
and so rather than just a visual

1066
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,079
interpretation of the image name deem

1067
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
would you like to provide it

1068
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,040
no i i wait to you down in the next okay

1069
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,960
so here here what i see is that in the

1070
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
traditional social cognitive inferential

1071
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,720
accounts

1072
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,839
the gears are turning inside the brain

1073
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,480
and then there's perception action loops

1074
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
and linkages that connect social

1075
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,480
entities that are in their body but the

1076
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,640
body is seen as like an interface

1077
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,440
for that kind of information transfer

1078
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,520
one extreme stance or simple visual

1079
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,720
representation

1080
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,800
and then here in contrast we see like

1081
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,119
the gears are everywhere including in

1082
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,880
the environment in the niche in the

1083
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,240
space between

1084
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,359
and that yes the brain is doing things

1085
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
but also it's part of an enacted system

1086
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
that is implementing this encultured

1087
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
social cognitive process a little bit

1088
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,119
more in a holistic framing so dean yes

1089
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,119
yeah i was just going to say

1090
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,400
in a minute we're going to look at what

1091
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,079
the abduction thing talks about but for

1092
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:12,880
now

1093
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,119
i would like people just to sort of hold

1094
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,960
in their mind the idea that

1095
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,440
this is speaking to a type of temporal

1096
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
depth but that temporal depth is

1097
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,599
vertical

1098
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,240
i think abduction looking at longer

1099
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,400
timelines for hundreds of years is more

1100
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,040
horizontal so just keep in mind that

1101
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,880
we're talking temporal depth but the

1102
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,440
focus is on a vertical or a deep

1103
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,800
temporal depth instead of a wide lateral

1104
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
temporal depth

1105
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,319
they both matter but they're orthogonal

1106
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,560
doesn't mean that they're in conflict

1107
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
with one another it just means they're

1108
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,200
going in different directions that's all

1109
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,119
i want to say about that

1110
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,200
it's funny left and right or west and

1111
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
east those are contrary directions but

1112
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,079
they're not negatory directions and so

1113
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,520
right there is where we start to see

1114
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
like how orthogonality or sparsity

1115
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
or conditional independence

1116
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,720
granted by a markov blanket for example

1117
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,560
how those can be seen in the framework

1118
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,119
of contraries though not negations

1119
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,200
stephen

1120
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,760
and that gear in the in the right hand

1121
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,640
diagram there the the gear in between

1122
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,400
you know that can have temporal depth

1123
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,520
that can have this mind-body environment

1124
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
piece is definitely there like you're

1125
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
saying and obviously makes as a unit of

1126
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
analysis that's really challenging and i

1127
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,280
would also put in there as a gear words

1128
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
words are

1129
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,560
twitch

1130
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
twitching of our voice box is giving us

1131
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,599
words in space around us

1132
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,319
so you know they're being used as tools

1133
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
as well so suddenly

1134
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,880
we're much more enmeshed even if it's

1135
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,440
just speech

1136
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
yeah and it takes time for the speech to

1137
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,520
travel through the internet and through

1138
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
space and time

1139
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
a little bit more depth on social

1140
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,880
inaction

1141
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,760
this uh inaction research resource

1142
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,400
describes several meanings and senses of

1143
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
inaction

1144
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,040
in the performative and the bringing

1145
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,520
forth senses so please read

1146
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,480
and also a really nice 2009 paper in

1147
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,040
cognitive semiotics by de bruyne and de

1148
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,079
haan

1149
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,720
discuss some of the relationships of an

1150
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,119
activism in social cognition

1151
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,119
and they did an excellent job of

1152
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,560
summarizing what the inferential

1153
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,880
and the inactivist accounts can bring

1154
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
together and sort of

1155
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,359
discuss that linkage yes please dean

1156
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,960
yeah i

1157
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,880
read that people because i found it and

1158
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,640
here's an interesting thing if they're

1159
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
going to use a bridge metaphor

1160
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,960
i think an activism does have a bridge

1161
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,119
it's just a vertical bridge

1162
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,760
it's the side of a building going up

1163
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
and so

1164
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,920
um

1165
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,839
nothing not in not to criticize what

1166
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,680
they've written here but i think there

1167
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,359
is a debt

1168
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,760
and there is an ability to span it's

1169
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
just that it's going

1170
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,240
vertical it's not going traditionally

1171
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
side to side

1172
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,599
awesome

1173
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,480
so on to a little bit of depth into

1174
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,440
abduction and semiotics

1175
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,480
well

1176
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
we had quite the learning journey

1177
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,640
together

1178
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
and the

1179
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
abduction paper

1180
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,960
with

1181
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,200
one or one and a half or even two of the

1182
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,400
authors being true pearson experts

1183
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,640
provided many details

1184
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,040
pierce was a prolific writer and thinker

1185
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,520
and collaborator and also much of the

1186
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
work was unpublished which means that

1187
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,119
there are some arcane reference systems

1188
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,920
and not all of it is hyper accessible

1189
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,880
we found the commons.org site to be

1190
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,599
immensely useful in providing many

1191
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,119
definitions as well as links to

1192
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
resources dean would you like to

1193
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,760
summarize anything on this page

1194
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
nothing other than if you if you

1195
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,720
if you are interested in

1196
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,880
pragmatism and you want to get past

1197
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
william james actually william james and

1198
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,760
charles sanders pierce had a bit of a

1199
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,560
they were they were maybe 150 years ago

1200
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,839
the first

1201
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,599
conflictors around how things work

1202
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,640
um it's actually really it's an amazing

1203
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,440
takeoff point in terms of how people who

1204
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,119
appear to be in competition with one

1205
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,560
another actually make one another

1206
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,280
smarter but in fact a lot of the things

1207
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,079
a lot of the ideas that we 150 years

1208
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
later are now looking back on we would

1209
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,480
have to say they may felt they were in

1210
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,160
competition with one another but i think

1211
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,800
what they were doing was relaying or

1212
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,359
somehow building a better model because

1213
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,960
they weren't always looking at things as

1214
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
through the same eyes they had both eyes

1215
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,520
open so that's i'll just say go go to

1216
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,760
the common site it's it's really good

1217
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,079
yeah it's great this representation

1218
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,319
ironically slash

1219
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,200
appropriately is of the well-known

1220
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,920
pearson triad semiotic framework where a

1221
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,319
stop sign is called the representamen

1222
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,760
the represented

1223
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,920
instance the physical stop sign the real

1224
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,280
stop sign

1225
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,480
the object is the message cars must stop

1226
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,280
here and the interpretant is i should

1227
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
stop here and that's where we get that

1228
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
entity agency

1229
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,680
i found a interesting paper

1230
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,079
about the user interface

1231
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,079
which brings some of these truly

1232
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,240
timeless discussions on semiotics and

1233
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,040
logic into a digital context

1234
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,200
they're applying that semiosis to the

1235
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,440
user interface metaphor

1236
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
one could imagine if that were a stop

1237
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,640
sign in the real world or if it were a

1238
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,720
button on a website in a user interface

1239
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,920
context

1240
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,800
and

1241
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,760
anyone may pause and read some of these

1242
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,359
very excellent selections from quotes

1243
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,960
and uh

1244
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,640
lectures given

1245
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,839
on how

1246
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,400
copies signs and symbols are linked

1247
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,560
through logic and semiosis

1248
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,040
a lot here but we'll carry on

1249
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,599
to abduction specifically so this was a

1250
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,839
little bit on pierce and the definition

1251
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
of semiotics as opposed to

1252
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,720
the science of things the more positive

1253
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,440
sciences and the science of forms which

1254
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,560
are the more formal sciences

1255
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,200
what is abductive reasoning

1256
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
this was very fascinating to explore

1257
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,680
this is a quote from the abduction paper

1258
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,440
they wrote it is common in the secondary

1259
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
literature

1260
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
eg that building on pierce

1261
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,960
to conceive abduction as occurring in

1262
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,359
two parts or two kinds

1263
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,160
generative abduction and selective

1264
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,839
abduction

1265
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,240
here's another perspective on the two

1266
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,079
types or the two varietals or two

1267
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,599
components two-stroke engine of

1268
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,720
abduction from the stanford encyclopedia

1269
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,319
uh philosophy

1270
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,839
they wrote in the philosophical

1271
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,000
literature the term abduction is used in

1272
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,640
two related but different senses

1273
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,400
in both senses the term refers to

1274
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
explanatory reasoning

1275
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,880
in the historically first sense it

1276
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,000
refers

1277
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,720
to the place of explanatory reasoning in

1278
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,119
generating hypotheses that's generative

1279
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,680
abduction while in the second sense

1280
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
which is the sense which it is used most

1281
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,359
frequently in the modern literature it

1282
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,760
refers to the place of explanatory

1283
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,880
reasoning in justifying or evaluating an

1284
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,359
enumerated set of hypotheses

1285
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,040
and in a sense it makes it makes sense

1286
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,440
the content has to be generated to be

1287
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,960
curated the ideas have to be specified

1288
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,160
enumerated in order to be justified or

1289
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,160
evaluated

1290
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,680
dean please continue on this

1291
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,559
well just just real quickly so

1292
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,559
we now have red and blue which was

1293
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,160
really really important to highlight

1294
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,960
that you need both you need a minimum of

1295
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,920
two for the explanation to

1296
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,440
appear

1297
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,720
next abductive reasoning in the

1298
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,400
probabilistic sense is also known as

1299
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,720
inference to the best explanation is a

1300
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
form of logical reasoning that looks to

1301
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,520
the most likely hypothesis to explain

1302
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,839
something an example did the white beans

1303
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,240
in the left hand come from the bag of

1304
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,319
objects held in the right hand here we

1305
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,800
can see how the hypothesis put forward

1306
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,240
depends on

1307
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,000
an incomplete observation or an

1308
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,319
inference are there beans also in the

1309
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,200
bag and even if so is that the source

1310
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,119
for what has been transferred to the

1311
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,280
left hand so again temporal depth

1312
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,400
when you arrive into a situation

1313
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,319
what what kind of background and what

1314
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,680
kind of context do you possess

1315
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,760
is going to go to this this fourth form

1316
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,640
of logic that or purse look literally

1317
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,240
spent a lifetime

1318
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,359
trying to

1319
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,280
disentangle and then

1320
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,880
reform into some sort of coherence

1321
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,760
and

1322
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,319
those listening along may start to see

1323
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,920
inklings of priors sensory observations

1324
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
posterior updating of beliefs about the

1325
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,640
world even action selection coming into

1326
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,040
play especially translation of the

1327
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,520
affordances instantaneous action

1328
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,400
availabilities into policies which can

1329
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
be evaluated by their expected free

1330
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,240
energy but we're going to get there

1331
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,520
let's turn

1332
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,680
to abduction and here are some of the

1333
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,160
very fascinating papers available on

1334
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,920
commons related to abduction a lot there

1335
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,319
and to kind of continue on with one of

1336
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,720
the resources from commons on

1337
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,680
abduction as practical inference

1338
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,040
by thomas capitan

1339
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,880
this work

1340
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,240
which we're not going to read everything

1341
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,559
about goes into a lot of interesting

1342
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,520
points

1343
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,040
about that dual nature of abduction

1344
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,680
with hypothesis generating

1345
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,319
and hypothesis selection

1346
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
and distinguishes that hypothesis

1347
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,000
selection

1348
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,359
can make deductively valid evaluations

1349
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,520
however the creativity phase is

1350
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,280
non-inferential that has a lot of

1351
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,960
resonance with like not pre-censoring

1352
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,040
ideas and having like an inclusive

1353
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
discussion when brainstorming

1354
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,760
and recognizing that there has to be a

1355
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,920
winnowing in a finite period of space

1356
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,319
and time

1357
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
additionally there's some discussion

1358
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,160
here

1359
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,200
this was

1360
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,160
relating

1361
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,400
as we move back towards or interweave

1362
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,280
with free energy principle

1363
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,760
initial awareness of the hypothesis

1364
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
comes with the observation of a

1365
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,520
collogated whole by means of an

1366
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,599
uncontrolled insight into the world of

1367
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,640
ideas into what he called thirdness as

1368
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,200
given in perception

1369
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,319
the novel conceiving of any instance of

1370
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,920
premise 2

1371
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
citing a previous part of paper is

1372
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,880
caused by prior cognitions

1373
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,160
priors

1374
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,359
its content is suggested by the facts

1375
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,839
observations sensory observations

1376
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,920
but not everything suggested is inferred

1377
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,400
from the cognition of the facts

1378
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
and so

1379
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,440
pierce goes on to describe there are

1380
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,800
operations of the mind which are

1381
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,640
logically exactly analogous to

1382
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,720
inferences

1383
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
accepting only that they are unconscious

1384
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,319
and therefore uncontrollable and

1385
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,960
therefore not subject to criticism so

1386
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,640
leaving aside questions like whether

1387
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,920
unconscious processes could be

1388
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,079
considered controllable

1389
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,920
here we very much see hints of

1390
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,319
perception as unconscious inference and

1391
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,800
we see also continuity

1392
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
between processes of attention and

1393
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,920
awareness

1394
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
conscious inferences

1395
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,960
and other subconscious inferences and so

1396
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,440
in a way this is also providing an

1397
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,760
integrated framework of perception

1398
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,559
learning belief updating temporal depth

1399
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,200
conscious and unconscious awareness all

1400
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,160
of these features are explored in the

1401
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,960
persian work and the abduction

1402
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
paper is going to very specifically

1403
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,640
highlight that fact

1404
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,760
okay carrying on a little bit more

1405
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,040
uh abduction and retroduction

1406
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,240
would you like to add anything on this

1407
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,119
one dean

1408
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,520
well i mean people that studied it and

1409
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,440
analyzed this

1410
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,680
wonder at times whether or not this was

1411
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,920
a

1412
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,480
morphology or whether or not we can use

1413
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,839
the two terms simultaneously or

1414
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,160
interchangeably

1415
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,520
again it's probably one of those things

1416
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,880
where if you

1417
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,720
want to find out what the details are

1418
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,079
you should probably go and have a look

1419
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,800
because it's interesting but it doesn't

1420
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,440
at this point all we basically want to

1421
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,839
do is

1422
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,839
here i'll just read this

1423
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,680
retroduction of the process whereby from

1424
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,359
the surprising array of facts we are led

1425
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,160
to a

1426
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,640
conjectural we've used conjecture a lot

1427
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,640
theory to account for them many

1428
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,720
logicians refuse to call this last

1429
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,000
inference

1430
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,319
because its conclusion is so extremely

1431
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,640
problematical as to amount a little more

1432
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,559
than an interrogation

1433
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,160
i'm sure they are wrong however they

1434
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,520
have not possessed

1435
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
themselves of the true scientific

1436
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,760
definition of inference so what he's

1437
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,400
basically saying here is let's not

1438
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,760
call

1439
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,440
abductive reasoning infrared um

1440
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,280
inductive reasoning

1441
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,880
the logical justification of a

1442
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,640
retroduction of which the proper

1443
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
conclusion is that the conjectured state

1444
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,240
of things is likely

1445
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,720
in the vague sense of tending

1446
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
to resemble the real

1447
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,200
state of things and i this is the part

1448
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,440
where so what replaces that

1449
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,280
instrumentalism

1450
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,359
whatever whatever we define as

1451
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,040
instrumentalism

1452
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
this is again

1453
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,280
this is one of those conundrums if it's

1454
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,720
not if it's not

1455
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,599
real

1456
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,720
state is it what isn't then what is an

1457
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,680
unreal or a non-real state because it's

1458
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,960
there

1459
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,640
we've labeled it

1460
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,880
what what fills that what feels that

1461
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,839
eventually to make the whole that's the

1462
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,920
question here

1463
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,559
and also again worthwhile reading some

1464
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,960
of the prior work of one of the authors

1465
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,520
of the abduction paper and one can see

1466
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,480
in their research a strong line of

1467
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
developing and extending and modernizing

1468
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,920
a lot of the work

1469
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,040
let's just

1470
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,599
yeah so i put down those uh bear signs

1471
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,880
because i want to tell a really really

1472
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,640
really quick story

1473
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,359
so if you live somewhere where there are

1474
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,559
bears if the bear sign stays up

1475
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,200
people begin to ignore the actual

1476
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,559
sign

1477
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,599
object

1478
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,680
and they no longer become interpreters

1479
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,760
they they willfully

1480
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,640
lose that triadic so

1481
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,119
if you're in the business of

1482
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,640
of animal

1483
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,440
welfare and you don't want bears to

1484
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,520
become too

1485
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,760
used to human contact you have to be

1486
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,839
very selective when you put the sign up

1487
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,400
and most importantly when you remove the

1488
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,760
sign

1489
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,520
so i wanted to put that up there because

1490
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,599
that's a big part of the abductive and

1491
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,760
retroduction piece it's

1492
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,240
you have to sometimes take things away

1493
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,200
for abduction to work it's the removal

1494
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,960
of possibilities

1495
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
that actually

1496
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,440
creates an emphasis

1497
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,359
i think we'll just carry on to realism

1498
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,720
and instrumentalism because we're going

1499
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,400
to come back to abduction in the

1500
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,480
subsequent discussions more so

1501
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,160
here are some quotes from a fair bend

1502
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,760
paper

1503
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,079
according to realism such knowledge

1504
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,760
factual knowledge is descriptive of

1505
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,680
general or particular features of the

1506
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,079
universe so that doesn't mean that the

1507
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,200
model of gravity is gravity doesn't mean

1508
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,880
that the model of gravity is what the

1509
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,040
objects of gravity are

1510
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,280
but a realist would remark that for

1511
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
example formal models of gravity teach

1512
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,160
us of the existence of

1513
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,440
objects acted upon by the force gravity

1514
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,680
and license the description of a force

1515
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,520
which cannot be directly seen heard or

1516
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,559
felt but still has noticeable

1517
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,599
influence

1518
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,760
forces are real things are real

1519
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,599
according to instrumentalism

1520
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,040
even a theory that is wholly correct

1521
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,760
does not describe anything but serves as

1522
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,119
an instrument for the prediction of the

1523
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,960
facts that constitute its empirical

1524
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
content

1525
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,760
and so again on this newton's

1526
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,079
gravitation example the instrumentalists

1527
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,839
could take the position there are no

1528
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,040
entities

1529
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,359
gravitation force and gravitational

1530
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,480
fields

1531
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,440
are merely instrumental applications

1532
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,280
of statistical

1533
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,520
arguments or potentially even social or

1534
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,680
power dynamical arguments

1535
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,520
and an instrumentalist may deny the

1536
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
existence of objects

1537
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,079
entities and forces in this case

1538
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,880
and even take things to the level of

1539
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
having skepticism around words as

1540
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,680
instruments and the relationships around

1541
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,119
communication

1542
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,520
and how it orders and predicts sense

1543
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,400
data

1544
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,680
we've explored realism and

1545
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,079
instrumentalism quite a lot over the

1546
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,880
streams and we highlighted a lot in mel

1547
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,040
andrews work in live stream number 14.

1548
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,559
one more slide on realism and

1549
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,640
instrumentalism and then either of you

1550
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,400
please feel free

1551
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,200
um

1552
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
i'll describe some of the bottom ones

1553
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,680
again the map territory distinction is

1554
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,480
very

1555
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,440
key to the realism and instrumentalism

1556
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,960
conversation

1557
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,599
there's also been variety of excellent

1558
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,760
philosophical work

1559
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,839
for example a successor to the realism

1560
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,319
anti-realism question

1561
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,079
those two by the way i would say are

1562
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,079
negations whereas realism and

1563
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,440
instrumentalism

1564
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,200
we are suggesting might be seen as

1565
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,559
contraries

1566
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,480
and also helen longano's work on

1567
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,119
scientific pluralism has a lot to say

1568
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,240
about this by taking a

1569
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,599
multi-disciplinary lens on realism and

1570
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,960
instrumentalism

1571
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
and then dean would you like to describe

1572
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,119
anything about this top paper you found

1573
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,119
uh

1574
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,880
i could i don't remember this in the

1575
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,359
grand schemes to be honest it's here for

1576
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,359
people to read there were many papers

1577
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,640
and again we're just putting a lot of

1578
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,400
text up for those who want to pause and

1579
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,920
follow the trails

1580
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,799
and it all kind of gets enmeshed in

1581
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,559
stephen any comments on realism

1582
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,280
instrumentalism

1583
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,640
i suppose the piece that i

1584
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,119
comes to mind for me a lot is

1585
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,240
all of this is then underpinned

1586
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,680
within action at some level so

1587
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,799
the the

1588
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,119
the idea of looking for

1589
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,280
um different

1590
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,319
contradictions or different um

1591
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,760
retro

1592
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,680
approaches

1593
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,720
could be a case of you imagine

1594
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,640
when someone thinks about taking a path

1595
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,160
through the woods

1596
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,040
you know or you could re-embody a lot of

1597
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,160
these things

1598
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,799
or and maybe everything at some level is

1599
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,520
is goes through some embodiment

1600
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,440
um and when it's conceptual that

1601
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,839
embodiment is just happening in a more

1602
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,760
conceptual space

1603
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,200
um that doesn't rely on as many other

1604
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,240
um

1605
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,400
kind of stories or

1606
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,960
feeling your way through things

1607
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
so um

1608
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,240
the difference that happens when you're

1609
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,920
in a field of practice is that you're so

1610
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,680
used to being in that field of practice

1611
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,799
that

1612
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,599
that embodiment becomes the water that

1613
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,160
you swim in

1614
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
so that could be

1615
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,720
something that sort of relates to this

1616
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,960
great yes dean just real quick so

1617
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,680
again we'll ask at this point yes to

1618
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,359
realism

1619
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,839
yes to instrumentalism

1620
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,559
yes to the end

1621
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,119
not or

1622
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,480
undone

1623
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,359
we had a little ampersand here and we

1624
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,599
the and here

1625
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,040
um one brief note on for e cognition

1626
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,920
we won't go into depth here but 4e can

1627
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,040
refer to as per the xiavio and van der

1628
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,200
schiff 2018 paper which was in the

1629
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,280
context of music pedagogy which is a

1630
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,040
very fascinating area 4e is embodied

1631
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,880
embedded embedded

1632
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,799
extended enacted

1633
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:14,240
encultured etc etc etc 7e 11e 22e all of

1634
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,799
them and then a fun quote from carl

1635
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:17,839
fristen

1636
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,280
from our

1637
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,040
applied active inference symposium in

1638
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,559
2021

1639
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,559
he said one key thing about active

1640
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,599
inference

1641
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,359
is it's it's beyond predictive

1642
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,359
processing it's beyond sentience and it

1643
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,440
emphasizes or reflects the pragmatic

1644
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,920
turn at the beginning of this century

1645
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,240
really epitomized by the four e's

1646
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,760
to make it clear that sentience is

1647
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,720
active

1648
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,119
and that you are talking about

1649
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,200
the circular causality of engagement

1650
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,680
with any particle personal or plant with

1651
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,400
whatever's out there purple circular

1652
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,040
causality and all of that entails

1653
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,200
then quite briefly we're not going to go

1654
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
into any of these details but here's a

1655
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,440
bunch of work that's relevant for the

1656
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,880
inactive paper

1657
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,400
just some of the other background

1658
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,880
citations and other work that one might

1659
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,480
want to look into

1660
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,280
and for the abductive paper

1661
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,440
and also a little bit of leaning even

1662
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,839
into something hopefully the authors can

1663
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,559
unpack for us on the the role and

1664
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,720
relationship of nominalism with all of

1665
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,440
this but many previous papers by the

1666
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,720
authors here

1667
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,359
listed and a lot of great work again so

1668
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,119
thanks you fellows for

1669
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,400
this journey

1670
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,280
now

1671
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,680
we can enter into the two papers or the

1672
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,399
space between

1673
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,000
let's have an initial juxtaposition of

1674
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,640
the two papers i'll put our video will

1675
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,480
be the tip of the iceberg here so dean

1676
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,319
you're the tip of the iceberg what would

1677
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,559
you like to say about these two papers

1678
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,079
in an initial juxtaposition

1679
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,720
well as i said i think

1680
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,680
if you actually step back and realize

1681
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
that what people are doing by

1682
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,559
by pairing to active inference

1683
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,160
you are saying

1684
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,960
i have i have a a particular kind of

1685
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,520
situational analysis that i would like

1686
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,400
to perform and in doing so i would like

1687
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,039
to try to remove contradictions or i

1688
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,240
would like to

1689
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,559
formulate integrations

1690
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,520
and if you step back to that place

1691
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,400
your

1692
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,839
your example of so your your hyper your

1693
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,640
hyper um

1694
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,720
your head your subject is is sub uh

1695
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,119
situational analysis your example

1696
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,799
fitting under that

1697
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,200
you're not now making

1698
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,799
the mistake of saying

1699
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,280
my way of do it looking at things

1700
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,559
automatically negates or turns other

1701
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,400
ways of looking at everything that's

1702
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,280
under that title a situation situational

1703
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,760
analysis to dust now

1704
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,760
there are comparisons and they're not

1705
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,359
written here and they're so ready along

1706
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,400
i just basically chose examples within

1707
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,160
each of the papers where

1708
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,640
papers are talking about two different

1709
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,119
focal points but they're still within

1710
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,960
this larger larger

1711
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,079
marginal

1712
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,839
boundary of active inference and how

1713
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,200
active inference

1714
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,280
is behaving

1715
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,440
around the behavior

1716
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,200
within a regime of attention and opening

1717
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,000
that up to something more available than

1718
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,079
the specifics or the scale friendly

1719
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,359
thing of does theory of mind necessarily

1720
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:26,400
blend

1721
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,319
with active inference or

1722
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,359
does the idea that abduction the moment

1723
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,000
when i arrive actually

1724
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,799
negate any possibility of using

1725
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,079
instruments to extend my my sensory

1726
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,359
window

1727
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,880
right so again we're not going to spend

1728
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,559
a whole lot of time

1729
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,240
pulling those other things out but if

1730
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,960
people want to actually see how when you

1731
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,440
set approximately two papers beside one

1732
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,280
another you can find a ton of

1733
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,599
similarities

1734
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,280
it's kind of an interesting exercise it

1735
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,400
takes a while

1736
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,000
but when you actually see them side by

1737
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,240
each and entangled there's a there's a

1738
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,359
lot of braiding going on

1739
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,480
thank you dean stephen

1740
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,960
yeah i like this um

1741
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,480
like dean was talking about there you've

1742
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,640
got these two papers it could almost be

1743
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,280
seen as two icebergs where

1744
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,039
their their philosophies are kind of

1745
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,559
frozen and

1746
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,640
given shape and form and there is stuff

1747
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,480
underneath and stuff above

1748
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,319
but there's also the water around in

1749
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,599
between

1750
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,039
which may have

1751
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,200
lots of uh shrimp and all sorts of

1752
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,599
things swimming around so

1753
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,680
i think in this this list here where

1754
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,640
you've kind of got realism

1755
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,000
instrumentalism well they're your two

1756
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,599
icebergs right

1757
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,440
we want them to be nice and sharp

1758
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,200
and maybe you get knocked a bit if you

1759
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,839
bang off them and then okay statistics

1760
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,160
and model comparison

1761
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,440
you know

1762
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,440
they they they're still out there but

1763
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,359
they might jive a little bit multi-agent

1764
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,359
belief communication oh hold on we've

1765
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,520
got something flowing here

1766
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,000
things as assembled ensembles sorry

1767
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,319
models as ensembles

1768
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,000
perspective

1769
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,319
or tights perspective or where are those

1770
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,960
perspectives coming from ways of knowing

1771
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,440
stochasticity complex systems

1772
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,680
and so forth

1773
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,559
um

1774
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,559
we're now maybe

1775
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,559
i don't know if we're not dissolving the

1776
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,640
the iceberg that's not about that the

1777
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,400
iceberg's there but we're they're

1778
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,240
different types of um

1779
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,599
ways and

1780
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,119
of starting to maybe be more flexible

1781
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,400
and less stable

1782
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,720
awesome so into the inactive paper we go

1783
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,920
so to keep things reasonable and also

1784
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,200
have a lot to discuss in the one and two

1785
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,079
again we put a lot of content onto the

1786
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,119
slides for your pausing and enjoying

1787
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,680
most of the content is copied and quoted

1788
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,760
from the paper so that is the point of

1789
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,520
reference to learn more

1790
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,599
we'll just walk through

1791
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,680
in the order of the roadmap some of the

1792
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,480
key

1793
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,839
pieces that the papers go through so

1794
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,799
in section one of the inactive paper

1795
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,920
they're going to begin with a

1796
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,359
summarization

1797
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:16,799
of vessier at all's 2020 argument for

1798
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,960
understanding others in the world and

1799
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,119
that's presented in this thinking

1800
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,760
through other minds ttom paper and then

1801
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,559
tom is theory of mind

1802
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,319
they summarize

1803
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,480
or capture the argument of thinking

1804
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,599
through other minds as one

1805
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,000
premise one social cognition is inactive

1806
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,119
and embodied two inactive and embodied

1807
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,079
the social actor cannot directly grasp

1808
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,319
social cognition

1809
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,240
three anything that cannot be directly

1810
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,240
grasped must be inferred

1811
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,000
ergo qed conclusion inactive and

1812
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,240
embodied social cognition must be

1813
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,280
inferred there must be inference about

1814
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,520
social cognition

1815
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,079
and the authors of the inactive paper

1816
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,280
state that by premise two and three

1817
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,960
ttom joins the tom orthodoxy

1818
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,960
understanding the world and others to

1819
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,240
them comes down to the ability to infer

1820
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,880
and attribute mental states

1821
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,480
that is the uh summarization of thinking

1822
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,920
through other minds

1823
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,400
and they are going to call into question

1824
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,799
on this critical dissection that such a

1825
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,319
ttom account is indeed making this happy

1826
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:34,000
marriage with an activism

1827
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,119
they're going to pull on yes any anyone

1828
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,520
or continue okay they're gonna they're

1829
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,760
gonna they're gonna pull out on a few

1830
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,000
different of these premises

1831
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,960
and what hidden assumptions might be

1832
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,960
underlying those premises like what

1833
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,440
axioms lead one to generate such

1834
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,880
premises

1835
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
the contradiction between p1 and p2

1836
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,280
results from two hidden assumptions in

1837
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,240
that t2m argument so here we see p123

1838
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,200
above

1839
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,119
and then hidden assumption one

1840
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,599
social cognition reduces to information

1841
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,000
in explicit propositional form

1842
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,720
mental representation and ascription

1843
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,119
they are going to say this they are

1844
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,880
feeling this way as a mental

1845
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,319
representation

1846
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,839
and hidden assumption too social

1847
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,560
cognition is hardwired with the concepts

1848
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,799
and logical tools for inference for

1849
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,000
example

1850
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,520
at birth

1851
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,080
and in the subsequent sections

1852
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,679
they're going to analyze and clarify the

1853
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,520
contradiction between premises one and

1854
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,719
two

1855
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,799
this tension of

1856
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,560
if social cognition isn't active and

1857
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,679
embodied

1858
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,198
is it really the case or is it a

1859
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,960
contradictory claim

1860
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,960
that social cognition cannot be directly

1861
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,920
grasped by such a social actor

1862
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,679
they're then going to critically assess

1863
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,000
from the inactive perspective what

1864
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,600
problems might underlie these

1865
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,839
assumptions the hidden assumptions and

1866
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,238
why an activist reject these hidden

1867
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,439
assumptions

1868
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,600
and hence reject the premises listed

1869
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,960
above

1870
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,359
and then they're going to be exploring

1871
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,799
what are these non-representational

1872
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,399
methods and mechanisms of

1873
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,080
co-construction in social action

1874
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,960
they have a markov blanket

1875
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,439
a representation visually that we've

1876
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,040
seen here before

1877
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,000
with the internal states external states

1878
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,520
and the mediation of internal and

1879
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,000
external states by blanket states

1880
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,080
which as per the pearl 1988 definition

1881
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,719
are the blanket states making the

1882
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,080
internal and external states

1883
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,759
conditionally independent

1884
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,920
sometimes people go further and describe

1885
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,000
a fristen blanket where the blanket

1886
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,120
states b

1887
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,080
are partitioned into two kinds of states

1888
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
sense and active

1889
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,759
and those two kinds of states are

1890
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,719
defined by their incoming from the

1891
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,120
perspective of internal states

1892
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,600
statistical dependencies sensory states

1893
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
and outgoing statistical dependencies

1894
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,920
which can be interpreted as actions or

1895
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,600
interfaces from

1896
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,480
the entity or thing towards the niche

1897
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,400
but we'll come back to markov blankets

1898
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,280
and more later

1899
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,360
yes stephen go for it

1900
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,960
just coming back to that

1901
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,880
actually the page the slide before this

1902
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,040
but relating to this is when it says

1903
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,440
things cannot be directly there's a

1904
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,960
couple of things that directly be

1905
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,520
grasped well i would argue that with

1906
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,880
that that's a useful distinction because

1907
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,280
when we think about um we're talking

1908
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
about the grip and the grip or a pair of

1909
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,440
pliers and i can't directly grip a hot

1910
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,199
pipe i need the pliers i can't directly

1911
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,159
um do a number of things without maybe

1912
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,000
more than one tool

1913
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,440
but there's a sense that

1914
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,080
when we talk about grasping things or

1915
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
when people are thinking about if

1916
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,280
something is

1917
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,360
you know to grasp something

1918
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,040
that is explicitly propositional

1919
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,800
you know we have other kinds of tools

1920
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,719
that might be coming to play even when

1921
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,719
we think about words

1922
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,480
and the act of ascribing

1923
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,960
all of these things can be

1924
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,600
performances with tools at every level

1925
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,800
so there's a

1926
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,640
there's an interesting blending going on

1927
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,320
here depending on how

1928
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,120
the iceberg gets melted

1929
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,400
great

1930
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,159
in section two one

1931
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,040
which you can read in the paper or pause

1932
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,520
here and capture many aspects of it

1933
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,960
they're going to question the assumption

1934
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,040
that social cognition reduces to mental

1935
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,560
representation

1936
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,360
and

1937
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,040
their point can be distilled as

1938
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,800
understanding others is a matter of

1939
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,960
being skilled at shared non-explicit

1940
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,920
meanings

1941
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,679
and potentially some

1942
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,440
abductive

1943
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,320
ding-ding-ding and model-based reasoning

1944
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,159
all of which are context-specific

1945
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,320
modifiable and dynamic

1946
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,239
and they are going to unpack in the

1947
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,199
further paragraphs that in there in lies

1948
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,120
an evident contradiction between those

1949
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,120
first two premises which is really like

1950
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,280
the achilles heel or the soft spot where

1951
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,239
they're gonna be targeting their logic

1952
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,840
in section two

1953
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,440
they're going to question that second of

1954
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,880
the assumptions which is that social

1955
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,760
cognition is hardwired from birth

1956
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,800
and so while they do qualify the ttom

1957
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,000
position

1958
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,840
and they say vessier do not hold a

1959
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,480
nativist position for example like a

1960
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,880
pure inborn perspective

1961
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,560
because they do have a focus on the

1962
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,520
developmental and ecological dynamics of

1963
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,600
how culture is acquired

1964
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,840
they do call into question the

1965
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,400
acquisition of the starter pack

1966
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,800
and they're also exploring more in this

1967
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,000
section some inactivist critiques of for

1968
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,960
example hardwired perspectives on social

1969
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,520
cognition

1970
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,360
in section 3

1971
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,679
having critiqued assumptions that in

1972
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,320
their mind highlight the contradiction

1973
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,760
inherent within thinking through other

1974
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,480
minds they're going to suggest another

1975
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,000
relationship oh you don't like that dish

1976
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,679
let's try this one

1977
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,159
and this is going to be a

1978
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,719
approach from dynamical systems theory

1979
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,040
or dst they write

1980
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,560
dst

1981
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,480
as we shall argue in this section is an

1982
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,159
approach that serves to learn about and

1983
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,560
generate predictive power about the

1984
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,120
socioculturally situated practices of

1985
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,320
agents constructing their niche

1986
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,719
because dst has at its core

1987
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,880
useful tools such as emergence

1988
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,120
non-linearity and spontaneity etc

1989
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,640
it allows us to move away from

1990
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,679
prefabricated notions of tom theory of

1991
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,760
mind-like theories of social cognition

1992
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,600
one should therefore refrain from making

1993
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,600
ontological assumptions

1994
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,080
ontological here being about how things

1995
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,760
are in the world

1996
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,159
so more of the philosophers ontology

1997
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,840
rather than the computer science

1998
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,400
knowledge management sense of ontology

1999
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,840
one should refrain from making these

2000
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,679
kinds of ontological assumptions

2001
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,320
licensed by realism

2002
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,719
about the complex system based upon a

2003
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,159
tractable model

2004
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,600
so just because the model is so

2005
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,719
tractable

2006
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,360
doesn't mean that we have the license

2007
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,480
to make ontological assumptions

2008
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,920
since the tractable model is an

2009
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,920
opportunity for learning about the

2010
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,239
complex behavior only epistemic claims

2011
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,280
are allowed

2012
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,440
let us take a closer look at the claim

2013
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440
to make it tractable we can represent a

2014
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,600
dynamical system by a static

2015
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,760
relationship as follows and here are

2016
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,080
their equations one two and three with

2017
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,760
the captions below

2018
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,080
and they're using these very

2019
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,000
simple kind of like the kernel of the

2020
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
dynamical systems theory is

2021
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,360
understanding how

2022
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,320
things are a function of how they change

2023
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,560
broadly and it's represented in a few

2024
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,000
different ways

2025
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,640
in terms of a successor model and more

2026
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,040
of a ray of change model

2027
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,120
stephen

2028
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,719
i think this is a very

2029
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,199
useful point point number three there

2030
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,840
the bullet point because it also speaks

2031
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,840
to that sense of

2032
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,400
this is a modelling approach

2033
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,480
let's see what the model in

2034
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,040
is telling us rather than a model

2035
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,080
fitting

2036
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,440
approach

2037
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,600
um which is often you know what ends up

2038
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,960
happening if you have the defined

2039
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,640
ontology

2040
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,440
you know you effectively

2041
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,480
so many things so

2042
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,280
um

2043
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,960
that's maybe a key

2044
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,840
piece

2045
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,360
that links

2046
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
a lot of how things can be bridged in

2047
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,719
terms of active inference and how it

2048
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,480
could be held between

2049
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,360
you know

2050
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,760
that that is a

2051
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,159
is a stance in a way

2052
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,920
it's it's holding the legs apart and

2053
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,719
saying

2054
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:45,679
okay

2055
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,199
am i doing the splits or have i got my

2056
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,480
legs together

2057
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,000
right so

2058
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,400
let's find out rather than

2059
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,280
you t someone expert tell me

2060
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,400
um

2061
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,440
and

2062
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,120
yeah thanks

2063
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,800
thank you dean yes

2064
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,000
yeah i just wanted to add to what

2065
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,920
stephen was just saying i

2066
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,960
up to this point i really and i i love

2067
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,080
the paper

2068
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,400
that it's the constructivist piece

2069
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,679
though that i think

2070
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,120
has me

2071
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,800
pausing for a minute because i believe

2072
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,040
that in order for

2073
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,880
us to be able to

2074
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,480
make that decision

2075
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,440
is it the splits or is it a fork is it

2076
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,000
literally a fork and instead of having

2077
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,080
to go left to right that requires a

2078
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,520
deconstruction

2079
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,920
that i think is oftentimes left out

2080
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,640
prior to a reconstruction

2081
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,080
so again i'm not arguing with the

2082
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,199
authors because i think they're

2083
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,440
respecting the autonomy

2084
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,199
and i think they've done a brilliant job

2085
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,600
of saying okay this logic this deductive

2086
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,480
path that other authors have taken

2087
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,960
may not necessarily apply here because

2088
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,840
it causes too much blending so good good

2089
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,239
good you you're you're holding up what

2090
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,239
actually is left and right

2091
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,320
but you're leaving out the add

2092
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,560
the and part is it could be a fork that

2093
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,480
i could literally pick up and the only

2094
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,000
way you can see that is if you can

2095
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,360
deconstruct

2096
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,600
before you reconstruct and deconstruct

2097
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,440
doesn't mean differentiate that's

2098
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,000
already present deconstruct literally

2099
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,760
means as

2100
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,040
the oneness

2101
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,000
when did i arrive in this moment what

2102
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,239
have i what what parts of the puzzle am

2103
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,960
i still missing because i'm

2104
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,760
in in a hurry to figure out if i'm

2105
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,040
supposed to go left or right next

2106
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,679
especially in total context especially

2107
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,679
there

2108
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,520
yes stephen if you would like to give a

2109
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,120
quick point here thanks just adding to

2110
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,520
that um

2111
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,880
that piece of the situationalness

2112
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,320
um i

2113
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,000
believe that's where you come into the

2114
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,239
awareness of what's going on so science

2115
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,080
is very much telling us what's going on

2116
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,520
what is that thing what is

2117
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,600
this what is that

2118
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,719
but that fork in the road or being you

2119
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,199
know a team team age junction or

2120
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,280
something else

2121
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,840
ultimately there's awareness piece

2122
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,239
where is that situated and in active

2123
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,640
inference that's often more

2124
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,199
complex nebulous

2125
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,040
with the scientific being about the

2126
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,320
accuracy

2127
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
of the method well

2128
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,600
other times the awareness and the

2129
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,760
complexity comes in active inference can

2130
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,880
have both of those yeah great continuing

2131
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,600
on through the latter parts of the paper

2132
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,600
they talk a lot about complexity which

2133
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,120
many of us love

2134
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,960
so complexity complexity science

2135
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,520
complexity theory brings so many

2136
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,800
great

2137
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,600
terms concepts people methods tools

2138
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,120
ideas everything

2139
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,520
and they talk a lot about autopolicies

2140
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,440
and this recursiveness so there's a lot

2141
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,080
of really creative linkage linkages made

2142
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,480
in the inactive paper and complexity is

2143
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,280
used in a really valuable way

2144
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,800
in section four

2145
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,239
they're going to move into active

2146
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,760
inference in an inactive dynamic setting

2147
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,920
and that is where active inference is

2148
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,280
going to be deployed as an insightful

2149
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,600
instrument to learn about and understand

2150
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,440
the dynamics underlying cultural

2151
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,440
co-constructions

2152
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,440
considering it does not necessarily take

2153
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,120
agents as passive

2154
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,280
agents together are the authors of the

2155
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,520
states of one another

2156
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,120
and so

2157
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,040
kind of analogous to the inactive

2158
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,199
figures shown earlier where we had the

2159
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,480
gears in the head

2160
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,840
and then that went to like the gears

2161
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,440
being more distributed in the body and

2162
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,800
in the mind

2163
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,280
here in figure 2 there's more of a

2164
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,560
classical

2165
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,199
meaning and model based reasoning where

2166
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,120
different social actors are kind of

2167
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,920
having this inferential account that is

2168
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,159
very like one directional as shown here

2169
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,440
with an arrow pointing just to the

2170
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,320
middle and in figure 3 they're depicting

2171
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,960
the social action in figure 2 under

2172
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,760
active inference in terms of labeling

2173
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,640
here

2174
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,199
the internal states of the social actor

2175
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,480
2

2176
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,239
and the external states being social

2177
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,600
actor one so this is from the

2178
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,000
perspective of social actor two

2179
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,080
where the blanket states are being

2180
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,040
framed as sociocultural meaning and that

2181
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,960
model based reasoning

2182
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,360
which opens up for inferential accounts

2183
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,120
that are distributed

2184
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,719
and enacted

2185
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:21,310
and

2186
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,800
[Music]

2187
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,040
hopefully we'll go into more detail

2188
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,199
because this is where they are

2189
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,360
supporting their positive

2190
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,360
instrumentalist application of active

2191
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,960
inference into the social inactive space

2192
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,639
and then they write characterizing a

2193
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,800
social scene as analogous to scientific

2194
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,840
practice

2195
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,320
is there by a mischaracterization it's

2196
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,400
almost like taking what happens in the

2197
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,040
laboratory in a certain context and even

2198
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,960
a certain view on what happens in the

2199
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,679
laboratory in a certain context

2200
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,159
comma in a certain context

2201
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,639
and then critiquing that

2202
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,800
and thinking a bit more expansively

2203
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,080
about what happens in the hallways of

2204
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,840
the laboratory and in the basement and

2205
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,000
in the world around the building

2206
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,719
and that is also really nicely connected

2207
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,920
to some yellow bronberg at all's work on

2208
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,600
the anticipating brain is not a

2209
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,840
scientist which also focuses on the

2210
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,639
inactive perspective from an ecological

2211
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,639
perspective not only necessarily the

2212
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,560
social but the social is an important

2213
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,880
case

2214
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,040
in table 1

2215
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,520
they're going to discuss a little bit

2216
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,520
more about

2217
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,080
some of the dividers and contents of

2218
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,639
cells related to the natural world and

2219
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,760
scientific tools and constructs

2220
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,840
for sure we're going to return here in

2221
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,239
subsequent discussions so just check out

2222
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,600
table one

2223
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,960
see what you think

2224
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,480
what other lines would you draw would

2225
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,320
they be kind of like curved lines like

2226
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,239
look like letters would you circle

2227
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,080
anything would you draw some triangles

2228
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,840
would you add another row would you make

2229
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,560
it a tensor what else would you draw on

2230
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,920
table one

2231
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,239
even if only another double bounding

2232
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,560
line to emphasize that it's perfect as

2233
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,840
is dean

2234
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,560
all i would say is if you do go and have

2235
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,280
a look at this ask yourself why these

2236
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,440
hyper parameters and why

2237
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,520
these laterals

2238
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,360
because i think that will

2239
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,600
that will lead to all kinds of

2240
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,080
well for me it just got me so twisted

2241
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,679
around

2242
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,480
fun

2243
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,800
okay and then conclusion before we move

2244
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,360
to the second paper

2245
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,280
we have shown that holding both an

2246
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,520
activism and theory of mind entails

2247
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,040
contradiction and confusion

2248
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,960
this is evident when we critically

2249
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,120
dissect the two hidden assumptions held

2250
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,840
by tom like theories such as ttom which

2251
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,960
are rejected by inactivism those two

2252
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,360
covert assumptions that they believe

2253
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,239
disrepute the linkage

2254
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,199
and then

2255
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,040
they reiterate the co-constructive

2256
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,000
nature and the embedded and ecological

2257
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,639
components of social inaction

2258
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,120
and the recursion and the unfolding

2259
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,520
through time the rolling out of social

2260
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,719
inaction

2261
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,639
and they suggest that dynamical systems

2262
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:07,520
theory

2263
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,520
and active inference instrumentally

2264
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,320
applied as a type of dynamical systems

2265
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,440
modeling

2266
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,280
has promise

2267
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,239
and is a suitable and complementary tool

2268
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,239
to consider social understanding as

2269
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:23,280
generalized synchronization

2270
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,760
held in a certain way

2271
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,560
so that was that paper and

2272
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,719
it will now be paired

2273
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,520
with the abductive paper so

2274
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,080
one breath before we move into abduction

2275
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,520
yes stephen

2276
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,560
taking that breath um that last sentence

2277
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,360
there about how it can be

2278
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,000
um almost a bridge they're the the

2279
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,239
complementary um

2280
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,120
use of dynamical systems theory

2281
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,120
and sort of fills a gap they're sort of

2282
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,360
filling the gap and in a way i think as

2283
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,159
we talk about the abduction paper some

2284
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,239
of the gaps that doesn't fill

2285
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,520
i know we're not trying to talk about

2286
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,880
filling gaps here but let's say you're

2287
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,000
filling gaps

2288
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,760
abduction

2289
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,560
might also feel so you know the

2290
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,159
the beauty of the beauty of active

2291
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,679
inference and the bayesian approach is

2292
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,639
that lots of different

2293
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,440
scales and modalities and can be

2294
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,639
weighted and blended to give you

2295
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,360
um potentially a feel

2296
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,719
for what to do right so

2297
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,679
it doesn't mean one excludes the other

2298
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:34,800
awesome

2299
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,920
okay

2300
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,120
inter abduction

2301
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,239
we obtuse away

2302
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,560
the paper begins with a relatively

2303
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,280
short and very concise

2304
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,600
introduction to some of the key points

2305
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,199
of the paper

2306
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,440
we described earlier in their aims that

2307
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,080
they're interested in this naturalistic

2308
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,199
rendering

2309
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,920
of some of cs pierce's later

2310
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,320
eg post 1903 or post 1905

2311
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,880
mostly unpublished work

2312
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,960
unpacking the semiotic and logical

2313
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,280
notions of abductive reasoning which we

2314
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,480
covered in the context section

2315
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,639
they're aiming for this biological model

2316
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,560
of abduction

2317
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,800
which is going to

2318
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,159
thread the needle

2319
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:26,560
weave the fabric whatever it is

2320
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,400
that maintains the functional integrity

2321
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,080
of the organism

2322
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,080
the evolutionary imperative for that

2323
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,639
living being's existence and to be

2324
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,040
compatible with modern neuroscience

2325
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,040
they focus on the allegiance and the

2326
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,280
alliance which we talked about earlier

2327
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,360
and they'll introduce also in the

2328
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,719
introduction the markov blanket concept

2329
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,320
which will be a great point of

2330
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,120
juxtaposition to add a little bit more

2331
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,159
detail like if it is a front a contact

2332
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,000
front with active inference with social

2333
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,080
inaction and abduction

2334
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,960
then these are like hot points or points

2335
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,080
of contact within the interface front to

2336
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,880
really zoom in okay how is internal

2337
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,199
state being used in these two models and

2338
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,639
that's where the active inference

2339
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,320
ontology is of immense value because

2340
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,760
even when people are speaking in

2341
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,280
different languages or we have a

2342
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,400
computer program an equation a poem and

2343
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,480
then a scientific paper

2344
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,080
when we can link and proactively use or

2345
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,639
proactively annotate with the active

2346
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,400
inference ontology

2347
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,639
we gain the ability to not just say well

2348
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,960
we're both pointing at the moon

2349
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,800
is your finger my finger or are we

2350
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,320
pointing at the same finger because it's

2351
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,239
so far away and so maybe it's a little

2352
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,960
bit off and your your ray is missing the

2353
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,800
moon from my point of view

2354
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,600
and so on instead we can actually get

2355
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,679
down and not

2356
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,320
bleed out on the operating table

2357
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,280
but rather pin down transiently and find

2358
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,239
a attractor that helps us really go into

2359
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,719
that intersection rather than merely

2360
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,880
hitting and running with just points of

2361
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,719
resonance dean

2362
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,040
yeah again

2363
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,960
i'll just summarize that by saying we

2364
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,920
can situationally analyze better because

2365
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,840
we now actually have

2366
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,120
a way of being able to hold some some

2367
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,040
common

2368
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,639
thing together

2369
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,400
so that's all i want to add to what you

2370
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,080
just said

2371
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,159
and just adding one on to that as well

2372
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,960
is yeah sorry but um

2373
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,480
and where there may be

2374
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,080
a difference so

2375
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,360
you know like

2376
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,679
there could be this understanding of a

2377
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,920
lot of the terms the ontological

2378
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,080
understanding and say

2379
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,760
what often is a problem is if there's

2380
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,840
something that's not

2381
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,920
aligned but is

2382
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,040
just not noticed or is brushed over say

2383
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,360
okay this is different okay there's an

2384
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,960
ontological change here

2385
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,719
there's a way there's there's there's a

2386
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,199
way for that to be tractably

2387
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,560
like we have with active inference it's

2388
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,000
a tractable way to do it because

2389
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,840
otherwise there's so many ontological

2390
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,520
things floating around in this space

2391
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,360
which is its beauty

2392
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,760
that it's it's not cognitively possible

2393
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,199
to find what you need to look at

2394
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,480
thank you

2395
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,239
the next section

2396
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,159
again with these two lights

2397
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,880
co-illuminating co-constructing

2398
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,040
no two lights can physically overlap so

2399
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,600
there must be parallax induced by these

2400
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,840
two lights and shadows and all kinds of

2401
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,760
effects and maybe it's not the same

2402
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,679
wavelength and maybe you're walking

2403
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,280
around and different sides have

2404
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,679
different illuminations

2405
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,920
the section is on active inference in

2406
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,880
the light of abduction

2407
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,840
this

2408
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,960
is very

2409
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,040
fascinating section

2410
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:51,679
because they're going to take that

2411
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,080
almost

2412
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,960
quasi-algorithmic

2413
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,520
but certainly

2414
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,159
pre-computational

2415
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,440
framework

2416
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,600
being developed in the latter 1800s

2417
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,920
and early 1900s

2418
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,840
and start to

2419
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,360
interface and see

2420
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,000
how it relates to active inference

2421
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,320
so we can highlight more and we'll look

2422
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,000
forward to discussing in further

2423
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,920
sections so do pause it if you want to

2424
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,040
read all of this or read the paper

2425
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,639
but they're focusing on the late schema

2426
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,560
yes please dean all i was going to say

2427
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,159
is it's mood lighting if you actually

2428
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,000
look down at the bottom bullet the

2429
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,239
lighting is actually trying

2430
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:35,120
purse talked about it maybe maybe i

2431
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,440
don't know if he actually did have the

2432
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,239
formalisms to back that up

2433
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,239
but active inference actually does now

2434
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,880
talk about the kind of

2435
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,880
level of energy

2436
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,920
that we can now maybe

2437
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,199
see within the the two

2438
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:56,400
constraints that that that that idea of

2439
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,360
um

2440
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,760
parameterizing back to the vice grip

2441
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,520
sort of thing

2442
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,920
thank you so just a few quotes that are

2443
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,920
really fascinating here

2444
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,639
so

2445
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,520
in science abduction can be likened to

2446
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,719
the logic of discovery of hypotheses

2447
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,120
which as we discussed earlier has a

2448
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,520
generative creative element and then a

2449
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,360
secondary selective component like

2450
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,199
bayesian model selection bayesian model

2451
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,400
reduction

2452
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,159
and they even add with a cautionary

2453
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,400
remark that no full

2454
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,480
assimilation of pearson abduction can

2455
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,800
occur to ibe that's inference to the

2456
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,000
best explanation which is one half of

2457
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,280
the two-stroke engine and commonly

2458
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,679
people will use abduction to refer to

2459
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,080
probabilistic reasoning from a given set

2460
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,920
like abduction elsewhere in the writings

2461
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,400
this later schema

2462
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,120
those ones that are after 1903

2463
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,159
but

2464
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,400
according to experts have been the least

2465
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,000
research ones

2466
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,840
there's beginning with an observation of

2467
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,280
surprising factor events

2468
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,159
observation surprise

2469
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,800
and through a conditional major premise

2470
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,920
concludes in a co-hortative mood again a

2471
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,719
mood

2472
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,679
which piers termed the investigant

2473
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,960
it's like it has and right in it

2474
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,360
and that is that something of imperative

2475
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,760
importance ought to be done

2476
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,760
pragmatism inaction policy selection

2477
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,480
initially aroused by curiosity

2478
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,280
uncertainty reduction entropy

2479
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,719
that leads to the formulation of a

2480
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:33,679
question

2481
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,360
which is semantic

2482
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,159
and

2483
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,440
there's more discussion of the

2484
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,120
investigand mood and other moods

2485
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,440
yes dean one other quick thing

2486
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,679
cohorted or co-constructed from the

2487
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,760
other paper again

2488
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,040
share a common prefix that we

2489
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,040
again i think will maybe be able to

2490
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,080
tease

2491
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,600
some more of that

2492
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,600
the importance of that in the next few

2493
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,719
livestreams

2494
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,120
awesome

2495
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,440
they're going to continue with this

2496
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,199
question of the economy of research

2497
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,080
so

2498
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,800
they formed three argumentative course

2499
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,239
really specified areas of contact with

2500
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,400
active inference and abduction that

2501
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,800
they're suggesting form an initial trio

2502
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,239
or triad

2503
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,239
that will start to form the allegiance

2504
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,159
between active and abductive inference

2505
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,800
first the presence of

2506
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,840
non-degeneratively triadic relations

2507
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,320
then the utilization of the leading

2508
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,840
principles of abductive reasoning

2509
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,480
b and third the subjunctive conditional

2510
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,840
formulation

2511
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
there are some logical technicalities

2512
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,360
thrown around but

2513
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,239
that's what the streams are for

2514
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,000
in point a

2515
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,120
which you can pause and read the text of

2516
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,800
they're going to highlight the markov

2517
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,560
blanket concept

2518
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,760
or rather

2519
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,440
their realist

2520
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,159
interpretation as frist and blankets

2521
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:05,040
and

2522
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:05,920
argue

2523
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,719
that

2524
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,120
the markov blankets again implemented in

2525
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,159
a realist first and blanket sense

2526
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,400
have a markedly piercing

2527
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,679
irreducibly triadic form

2528
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,920
focusing on the boundary as mediator

2529
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,320
between external internal states and

2530
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,880
therefore the thirdness arising in

2531
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,480
semiosis

2532
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,159
there's a lot more to say but if either

2533
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,599
of you want to give one more point on a

2534
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,840
okay in b

2535
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,480
they're going to continue on by talking

2536
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,639
about some of the guiding principles of

2537
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:39,760
inference

2538
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,159
and specifically discuss abduction's

2539
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,040
role in guiding inference

2540
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,360
what is the leading principle of active

2541
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,679
inferences then

2542
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,040
here they're going to describe some

2543
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,600
technical details of active inference in

2544
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,080
terms of free energy variational or

2545
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,199
expected as bounding surprise

2546
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,600
and then they'll connect that to some of

2547
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,639
the primary sources of pierce and

2548
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,440
discussions of biosemiotics which have

2549
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,280
also been connected in a lot of

2550
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,560
discussions that we've had on

2551
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,440
representation and meaning and so on

2552
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,280
and

2553
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,719
it goes even further or deeper afield

2554
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,880
with discussions of

2555
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,320
synechism

2556
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,920
as well as this

2557
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,239
question of universal mind which is

2558
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:29,360
force aging in some ways the universal

2559
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,560
cognition pan cognitive dynamics

2560
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,280
distributed cognitive systems

2561
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,800
matter is effete mind by von schiller

2562
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,119
and then they're going to argue about

2563
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,360
pristine blankets and their construction

2564
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,520
in terms of triadic relationships

2565
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,360
pearson triad sign object interpret ant

2566
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,199
leads to unexplored semantic

2567
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,119
possibilities

2568
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,440
bringing together some of these broader

2569
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,560
qualitative threads in semiotic analysis

2570
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,280
with potentially dynamical systems

2571
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,920
theory quantitative bayesian methods and

2572
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,679
everything else that active inference

2573
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,440
brings along with the toolkits to

2574
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,839
implement

2575
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,360
and see

2576
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,880
they're also in c going to unpack some

2577
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,320
extremely

2578
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,520
interesting though nuanced logical

2579
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,600
constructive elements

2580
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,480
of

2581
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,719
the semiotic proposition

2582
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,159
if i could call it that

2583
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:29,679
go into it more

2584
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,760
in further discussions

2585
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,000
but they're going to explore

2586
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,840
how different

2587
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,360
framings of logical relationships

2588
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,600
amongst clauses or assertions and

2589
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,000
warrants and all this rhetoric

2590
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
relate to

2591
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,600
realism

2592
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,119
abduction

2593
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,000
and

2594
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,960
pierce's version of realism as the

2595
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,159
possible is what can become actual

2596
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:57,840
yes there are things that are possible

2597
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,520
but cannot become actual and then what

2598
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,760
do we use for that adjacent or

2599
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,400
realizable

2600
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,600
possible

2601
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,119
and

2602
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,119
where might we want to use it and what's

2603
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:10,639
going to break that symmetry where is

2604
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,600
pragmatism well what would be useful to

2605
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,840
consider would be the space of all

2606
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,760
possibles that could happen and none

2607
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,400
other and not be surprised by adjacent

2608
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,320
possibles that we didn't consider but

2609
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,760
did happen

2610
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,880
and then maybe it's not so bad to spend

2611
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,800
a little bit of extra thought or a few

2612
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,679
extra computer resources on considering

2613
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,880
possibilities that couldn't happen

2614
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,119
but we wouldn't want to get lost in the

2615
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:40,159
potentially exponential space of

2616
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,400
possibilities that can't happen

2617
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,159
and end up losing our focus and

2618
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,920
attention on possibilities that can

2619
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,400
happen which are what pierce describes

2620
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,000
as real possibilities

2621
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,760
and the pragmatist stance

2622
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:56,960
and mood

2623
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,800
also closes the loop with policy

2624
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,600
selection and pragmatism in active

2625
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,719
inference

2626
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,239
where they say that the pragmatist

2627
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,639
meaning of beliefs in the bane paris

2628
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,840
formulation

2629
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,960
is that upon one that upon which one is

2630
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,520
capable of acting

2631
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,040
and there's a lot of resonances there

2632
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,280
stephen

2633
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,679
yeah i think this also speaks then to

2634
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,000
the need to have

2635
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,080
we talk about scale friendly or levels

2636
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,800
or

2637
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,639
you know some sort of structure that

2638
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:27,760
enables

2639
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,920
this to be present because

2640
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,000
you know active influence can sort of go

2641
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,159
all the way down and brought in down to

2642
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,000
the cellular level as there's ways of

2643
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,360
looking at it

2644
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,040
here there's a sense that okay we're

2645
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,080
looking at

2646
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,600
these um

2647
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,760
ideas of um a signifier

2648
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,360
but we know with active inference it's

2649
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,360
not that it believes that we have

2650
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,679
signals coming in which get processed

2651
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,520
and aggregated

2652
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,199
so there's there's a sort of a scale at

2653
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,840
which you have the structures that you

2654
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,960
have the

2655
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,679
morphogenesis maybe to get to

2656
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,679
a scale to make

2657
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,840
the stop sign make sense

2658
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,159
to be

2659
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,400
interpreted

2660
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,440
um as its own

2661
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,840
signifier so i think that may be where

2662
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,080
there's this um tension going to happen

2663
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,119
between the inactivists here and and

2664
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,119
where that can happen but the argument

2665
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,280
could well i would say is that certain

2666
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,480
scales

2667
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,480
certain structures

2668
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,040
and maybe certain realist

2669
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,440
ways of things happening

2670
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,280
something like that

2671
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,159
is feasible

2672
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,920
great just dean and then we'll quickly

2673
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,760
move through the rest let me just be

2674
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,719
real quick here i think especially in b

2675
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:47,760
and and until lesser extent and c

2676
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,880
the

2677
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,159
the business of how we take piercings

2678
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,360
piercing

2679
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,320
thinking

2680
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,119
into the active inference realm

2681
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,800
is built on an assumption and that is

2682
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,119
that the continue our our continuing

2683
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,679
existence our continuing

2684
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,679
reality um

2685
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,520
means that we're accumulating more

2686
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,639
experiences with the tools

2687
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,840
in the world the rules in the world and

2688
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,239
the pools and by pools i mean those

2689
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,400
aggregations that stephen was just

2690
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,000
pointing to thank you for bringing that

2691
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,199
up steven because that made me want to

2692
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,920
write this down aggregations as

2693
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,520
densities

2694
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,119
tale of two densities materializing

2695
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,760
so again i don't know

2696
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:32,960
that you

2697
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,840
exclusively say everything is real and

2698
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,920
then all the examples underneath it are

2699
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,159
also real because even pierce himself

2700
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,639
said that there is an aspect of this

2701
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:45,840
reality which we will never

2702
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,000
be able to describe as anything other

2703
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,719
than

2704
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,639
non-reality

2705
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,679
even though we're fundamentally using it

2706
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,440
so how does that

2707
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,960
how does that

2708
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,520
enable these densities to form and i

2709
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,600
know that sounds way the heck and gone

2710
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,639
out there

2711
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,639
i'm sorry but it's actually something we

2712
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,280
have to contemplate

2713
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,199
thanks

2714
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:10,960
they're then going to

2715
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,520
flip the script or at least the syntax

2716
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,159
and talk about abduction in the light of

2717
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,840
active inference

2718
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,000
here is where they kick off with that

2719
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,480
acknowledgement of the two-stroke engine

2720
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,880
with generative abduction and selective

2721
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,239
abduction

2722
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:28,320
and then they're going to connect that

2723
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,239
to some of the ontology of active

2724
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,960
inference in terms of like seeing

2725
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,280
selective abduction

2726
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,719
as a sampling

2727
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,000
process

2728
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,760
and understanding where generative

2729
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,760
abduction fits in

2730
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,000
so continuing on with seeing abduction

2731
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,400
from the light of active inference which

2732
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,400
we might even operationalize as saying

2733
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,360
like

2734
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,159
framing or viewing abduction

2735
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,679
from the perspective of the active

2736
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,360
inference ontology

2737
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,040
so rather than us

2738
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,560
self-electing

2739
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,080
as interpretance of active inference as

2740
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,840
some

2741
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,000
concept which we cannot necessarily

2742
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,239
speak for a concept

2743
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:10,639
we can't speak for english but we can

2744
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,639
use english words

2745
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,119
and so analogously we don't need to

2746
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:19,520
necessarily speak for active inference

2747
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,119
though i'm the last to say what those

2748
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,119
should or shouldn't do

2749
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,119
it's possible to

2750
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,440
use the active inference ontology and

2751
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,480
then it's kind of like a two-step

2752
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,520
checklist

2753
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,360
was the term in the act of inference

2754
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,440
ontology in the core supplement or

2755
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,760
entailed sections

2756
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,040
was it used

2757
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,800
in a way that was pragmatic that made

2758
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,880
sense in that situation

2759
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,840
in that multi-scale context

2760
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,239
and that is actually a two-step process

2761
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:48,880
to ask if we're speaking

2762
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,199
using active inference rather than if

2763
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,159
we're speaking for like an advocate or

2764
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,080
like a salesperson for active inference

2765
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,440
per se

2766
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,400
and they're going to restate the case in

2767
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,119
terms of the fap framework in the sense

2768
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:06,159
of and using the terms of

2769
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,360
and they're going to highlight the

2770
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,840
relationship of internal states

2771
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,000
to external states mediated through the

2772
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,960
blanket

2773
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,000
and they then go through this syllogism

2774
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,960
and they restructure and restate their

2775
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,480
qualitative schema of abductive active

2776
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,480
inference

2777
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,320
and they describe this

2778
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,400
action cognition perception

2779
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,280
loop

2780
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,159
where

2781
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:33,280
a surprisal any incoming

2782
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,920
sensory information is experienced

2783
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,199
and then

2784
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,840
they take that not just into the passive

2785
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,520
or even active interpretation of it

2786
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,440
in the context of a bayesian generative

2787
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,480
model

2788
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,000
but rather something that is unfolding

2789
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,760
in that mood of the investigant

2790
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,480
they do continue on

2791
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,760
and bring in uh important piercing idea

2792
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,400
of the economy of research

2793
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,560
so we'll go over this again hopefully

2794
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,840
with authors

2795
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,719
um it relates to pierce's theory of

2796
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,800
science

2797
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,840
pierce's original paper in 1970 or 1876

2798
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,920
on the economy of research

2799
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,840
wrote the doctrine of economy in general

2800
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,320
treats the relationships between utility

2801
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,000
and cost

2802
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,080
and specifically that is going to be

2803
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,719
related to research in this socially

2804
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,119
enacted pragmatic sense

2805
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:36,560
by asking how given expenditure of money

2806
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,400
time and energy

2807
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,760
what is

2808
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,199
going to obtain the most valuable

2809
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,719
addition to knowledge

2810
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,960
what experiment that my eyes could

2811
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,520
cicade to will have the most information

2812
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,639
gain

2813
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,800
what experiments could the researcher

2814
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,280
carry out to reduce their uncertainty

2815
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,920
the most about the natural system

2816
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,719
not merely to verify something they know

2817
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,480
not merely to falsify something that

2818
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,560
they know will be falsified but rather

2819
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,520
to exist in this optimal experimentation

2820
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,719
space

2821
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,760
and then pierce and later the authors

2822
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,040
are going to naturalize contextualize

2823
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,080
bring to the social cognitive area

2824
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,920
by asking well how does money time and

2825
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,080
energy happen because that optimal

2826
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,280
experiment is in cultured and it uses

2827
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,159
energy it uses reagents so perhaps in

2828
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,760
this way we could say that pierce was

2829
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,400
one of the first modern program managers

2830
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,040
for a major funding agency but no he

2831
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,000
wasn't and they discussed this economy

2832
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,600
of research a bit more

2833
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,119
they describe in this section

2834
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,199
how pierce

2835
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:48,320
promotes several

2836
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,679
values or virtues or qualities

2837
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,239
that characterize the economy of

2838
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:58,000
scientific hypothesis making

2839
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,600
in complexity

2840
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,560
which is like a de-risking

2841
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,840
breadth

2842
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,800
which speaks to unification

2843
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,560
and caution

2844
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,800
as the economic quality of avoiding

2845
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,040
diminishing marginal returns

2846
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,119
by skillfully breaking down questions

2847
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,360
into a series of small questions that

2848
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,360
can be answered with reasonable limits

2849
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,719
of investment

2850
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,639
how many interesting threads are being

2851
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:24,239
brought together

2852
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:25,920
for example questions that are broken

2853
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,119
down to binary yes no questions

2854
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:33,360
can be connected to information theory

2855
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,480
and quantum as well

2856
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:40,639
here dean i will let you

2857
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:44,119
speak to fairness

2858
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,400
i'll just read it to be fair and as

2859
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,600
briefly at the beginning of this paper

2860
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,800
there are no instrumentalist

2861
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,639
interpretations of fep and it's

2862
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,400
ingredients such as markov blankets

2863
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,520
but

2864
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,520
this is a footnote in this paper but our

2865
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,960
faith for one of a better word and

2866
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,520
realist credentials of fep as its roots

2867
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,000
in the pragma pragmatist optimism or

2868
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,199
rather its act of ameliarism about the

2869
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:08,400
gains from the alliance between

2870
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,880
evolutionary evolutionarily useful

2871
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,639
processes to contribute to maximizing

2872
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:13,760
survival

2873
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,920
if this pragmatist approach to realism

2874
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,320
displeases the elevated taste of one who

2875
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,400
looks for some staunch metaphysical

2876
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,159
criteria let a thousand

2877
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:24,800
flowers bloom i think what's fascinating

2878
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,520
about this is that

2879
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,119
to hold the idea that there is a realism

2880
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:34,400
is a very easily defendable position to

2881
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,119
take but even in the previous slide one

2882
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:38,560
of the things that

2883
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,440
that

2884
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,159
first talked about without saying them

2885
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,719
directly or at least not in those quotes

2886
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:45,840
was that

2887
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,639
that optimal position is some some

2888
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,080
element of exploitation or economy

2889
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,639
or simplicity or or somebody's done this

2890
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:56,480
before me

2891
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,320
is that a shortcut

2892
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,280
and exploration which tends to take

2893
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,280
longer has more

2894
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,440
trial and error

2895
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,480
but also doesn't have you constantly

2896
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,080
over fitting

2897
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,400
to a particular outcome

2898
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,600
so

2899
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,400
um

2900
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,159
that's the reality

2901
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:18,000
and again i wouldn't i wouldn't push

2902
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,880
back on the claim that there is a very

2903
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:21,679
real

2904
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,040
piece to this

2905
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,000
playing

2906
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,719
play a minimum of two going back and

2907
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:28,000
forth in this

2908
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,360
um

2909
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,239
so

2910
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,560
i'm not just in fact i fully agree with

2911
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,639
these authors like i fully agree with

2912
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:36,560
the other authors about

2913
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,280
about the idea of a co-construction so i

2914
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,880
don't know that

2915
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,600
you you you are

2916
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,119
you are necessarily um confused if you

2917
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:52,719
can say yes and yes and yes again

2918
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,639
steven

2919
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,280
yeah sort of adding to what being saying

2920
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,920
there and

2921
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,320
the idea of

2922
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,000
implementation or

2923
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,639
exploitation definitely is being alluded

2924
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:07,360
to

2925
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,199
and in science

2926
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,360
there's

2927
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,560
experimentation is sort of the way of

2928
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,080
gaining knowledge

2929
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,639
but there's the exploration piece and my

2930
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,360
i would argue that

2931
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,880
you can't get

2932
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:25,040
exploration per se within

2933
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,159
the kind of

2934
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,280
objective domain there has to be this

2935
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,679
journey into the into the into the

2936
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,080
performative subjective into subjective

2937
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,679
liminal

2938
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,080
as einstein did with his mind games all

2939
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,440
these and you create these sort of

2940
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,800
mental uh constructs in a way what some

2941
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,040
of what's happening today is a mixture

2942
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,320
of that and then that's brought back

2943
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,199
and modeled experimented with whatever

2944
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:53,920
um

2945
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,000
so i think there's a i mean modeling is

2946
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,080
interesting because

2947
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,719
it's uh it kind of can come on that

2948
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,040
journey a little bit as well

2949
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,159
so that's

2950
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,600
that's could be something which

2951
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,239
experiments can't do

2952
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,960
here's a summary of an old joke person a

2953
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,639
says a

2954
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:15,280
and the referee says you're right person

2955
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,239
b says b the referee says you're right

2956
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,400
and person c says well a and b can't be

2957
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,880
right and the referee says you know

2958
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,199
you're right

2959
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:26,960
it's a little rapid humor for those who

2960
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,480
like that genre

2961
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,239
um they then have a conclusion section

2962
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,040
and

2963
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,280
we have many questions and points to

2964
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,119
make and a lot of connections to bring

2965
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,000
back

2966
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,560
to a lot of the naturalization here

2967
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,400
like the fields in levin

2968
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,159
work and they even take it to the

2969
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:47,040
regenerative capacities of flatworms so

2970
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:47,840
from

2971
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,480
flat worms to flatmates

2972
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,320
that's where we're going today

2973
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,719
and then we also saved up for the dot

2974
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:55,760
one

2975
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,560
some of the juxtaposition of the markov

2976
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,760
blanket concept specifically

2977
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,000
the social and active components of

2978
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,080
science which are super important and

2979
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,080
majeed has brought on to these

2980
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,480
discussions previously is a great point

2981
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,199
of contact with the abductive paper and

2982
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,199
the social inactive paper

2983
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,760
markov blankets represent like a very

2984
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,159
constrained even technical

2985
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,400
contact front that will provide a lot of

2986
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,840
discussion in the dot one

2987
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,199
and that is where

2988
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,520
we close the dot zero

2989
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,880
with uh

2990
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,320
again so much excellent groundwork and

2991
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,080
backpack packing

2992
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,560
by dean and steven so

2993
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,560
is there anything else you'd like to add

2994
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,639
at this point or anything arising that

2995
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,760
you want to discuss in the dot one yes

2996
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,000
dean then stephen if you'd like daniel

2997
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,400
fantastic job we just did an order of

2998
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,280
magnitude 3 from what was typically a

2999
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,440
single paper live stream and we still

3000
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,360
got it in under two hours so that you're

3001
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,440
you're to be applauded for that and

3002
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,119
secondly i just want to

3003
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,040
as maybe as a bit of a tip off for the

3004
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,599
dot one there's a research by the name

3005
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:08,480
of israel israel nunez who talks about

3006
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,400
if you want to be able to

3007
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,960
look at how things are deconstructed and

3008
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,639
constructed you have to look at both

3009
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:17,440
product in process an example being how

3010
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,199
do i build a car

3011
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,679
and process in product

3012
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,199
what is

3013
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,360
what is the thing that either a

3014
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,119
branching

3015
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:30,400
point or an actual utensil

3016
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,040
and so if you if you open your mind up

3017
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,199
to both that inversion

3018
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:37,360
along that continuum

3019
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,159
it opens up all kinds of possibilities

3020
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,880
in terms of bringing things into a place

3021
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,560
where they don't necessarily come into

3022
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,760
conflict yes they can integrate in braid

3023
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,000
and so maybe that will be

3024
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,360
after today

3025
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,520
something that people who are using

3026
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,760
active inference which in my opinion is

3027
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,400
both product and process and process and

3028
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,360
product

3029
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,599
at the same time it's the gripper and

3030
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:04,080
the grip maybe they'll maybe they will

3031
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,280
give some thought over to them

3032
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,520
it's almost like the pragmatist sees the

3033
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,320
fork in the road and uses it

3034
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,400
and maybe you use the fork by going one

3035
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,040
way and maybe you do pick it up maybe

3036
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,960
you use it by completing the table

3037
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,800
setting for someone else who will dine

3038
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,880
there and so there's so many ways to use

3039
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,639
because use is

3040
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,719
socially enacted abductive

3041
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:28,719
contextualized etc

3042
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:31,280
and again at the fork

3043
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:34,080
is where that conversation is happening

3044
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:37,520
and at our field site or at base camp is

3045
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,760
where we can imagine the forks and the

3046
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,040
roads that will come across stephen

3047
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,760
yeah and next in the in the dot one sort

3048
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,760
of finding a way

3049
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,840
to

3050
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,159
bring the authors if whoever's there you

3051
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,159
know on a bit of a journey maybe down

3052
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,840
one of the forks maybe it goes to the

3053
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,199
edge of the lake and we need to get in

3054
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,599
and get a bit wet

3055
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,480
so how can scientific

3056
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,159
abduction or some of the sort of more

3057
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:06,400
scientifically bounded

3058
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,639
models rules substantiated by

3059
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,080
experimentation and instrumentation okay

3060
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,199
when

3061
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,599
when does that get moved away maybe

3062
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,119
because of participation maybe because

3063
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,960
of transdisciplinarity maybe because of

3064
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,280
transformational processes maybe because

3065
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,920
of deep exploration

3066
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:28,000
outside of the field um i wonder this is

3067
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
something you might want to think about

3068
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,080
how can we

3069
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,320
give

3070
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,199
some sort of clear

3071
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,679
journey options right so that they can

3072
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:40,400
come

3073
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
a little bit off without getting stuck

3074
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,119
in a you know in quicksand or

3075
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,280
drowning in the in in the deep water

3076
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,199
right so we we want to sort of navigate

3077
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:52,159
but i think this this is given

3078
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,800
some of those um pointers i think of

3079
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,239
where there is

3080
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:58,239
sort of

3081
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:01,119
waze off-ramps as well as on-ramps so

3082
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,280
thanks

3083
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,639
thank you fellows

3084
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:05,920
thank you

3085
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,960
thank you

3086
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,760
this was huge i really really appreciate

3087
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,679
all your help

3088
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:16,040
great times see you in the doll one

3089
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,719
you
