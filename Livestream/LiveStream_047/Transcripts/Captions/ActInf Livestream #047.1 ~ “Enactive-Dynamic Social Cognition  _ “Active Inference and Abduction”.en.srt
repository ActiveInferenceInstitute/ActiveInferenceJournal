00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:27,680
[Music]

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,720
all right

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,400
hello and welcome everyone

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,399
it is active livestream number 47.1

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,160
on august 10th

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
2022

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
and we're continuing our explorations

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
into the paper dyad inactive dynamic

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
social cognition and active inference

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
of hippalito and venice

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
and active inference and abduction by

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
pietarennen and benny

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,199
welcome to the act imp institute we're a

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,520
participatory lab and institute that is

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
communicating learning and practicing

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
applied active inference links are on

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,959
the slide

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
this is recorded in an archive live

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,560
stream so please provide us with

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
feedback so we can improve our work

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
all backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,240
welcome

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
and we'll be following video etiquette

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
for live streams

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,720
head over to

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,080
activeinference.org to learn more about

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,640
other projects at the institute and how

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
to participate and join learning groups

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,960
today in

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
stream 47.1

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
we're continuing to learn and discuss

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
this pair of papers mentioned earlier

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
and on the previous video

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,640
and

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
we're going to open with some

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
introductions and then probably just

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
jump in wherever

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
anyone has a new

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,840
question they'd like to ask maybe ending

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,479
the introductions with blue so that you

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,520
can

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
bring um a new vector into the

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
conversation

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
so

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,399
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
california

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,119
and i'm looking forward to

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
taking a 0.1

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
lens a little bit to the paper

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,879
which had

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,400
an extended

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
dot 0 as there was so much to learn

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
on a few of these angles and so much to

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
kind of think about

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,470
that um

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,959
[Music]

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,440
what is the difference between

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,959
being in the bathtub and then in the

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,920
middle

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
of

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,959
the paper pair

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
versus for example coming into it to

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
contextualize it or trying to leave it

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
to apply it something in between even

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,239
there

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
i'll pass it to uh dean

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
thanks i'm dean i'm here in calgary um

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,360
i don't know if uh i don't know what the

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
dot one means because we've never done a

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
dot one where we've tried to pull two

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,760
things

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,319
put them proximal and see what happens

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
because sometimes that's

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
fire and water and just get a lot of

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
steam and sometimes it's uh nitro and

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
glycerin and the whole thing blows up on

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
you so i'm kind of looking forward to

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
that that's kind of the

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
risky part that i think is kind of

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,560
exciting i'll pass it over to stephen

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,040
hello thanks dean yes stephen here i'm

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
in toronto um

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
i'm really curious around

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,120
what this infusion of two different

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,879
approaches

87
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,280
to active influence can yield so

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
what's behind it all you know what's

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
behind

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
an approach of an activism that brings

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
in instrumentalism

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,720
or an approach that's more

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
mathematically focused bringing in

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
realism so i'm curious and hopefully

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
it's going to be useful and practical

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
i'm going to pass it over to

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
blue

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
hi i'm blue i'm in new mexico

99
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
i really um enjoyed reading so i've read

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,879
the i think we did the um hippolyto

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
paper before on another live stream um

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
and so i've read that one before but i

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
really enjoyed reading this

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
abduction and active in french paper i

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,238
do not have

106
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,000
like a strong philosophy background so i

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,918
kind of come at this like with a what is

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,919
this what is that like i have to go

109
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,800
search wikipedia 100 million times to

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,080
kind of get more information um about

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
from a philosophical um aspect and so

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
one of the key things like where i was

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,040
having a hard time like locking in

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
on this abduction paper active inference

115
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
and abduction

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
is um

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
why

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,120
do first in blankets

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
like like uh they presented the authors

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
presented it as if the first and

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
blankets like necessitate a realist

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
perspective so so is that true and if so

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
why is that

124
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
all right

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,919
thanks everyone

126
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,840
so two

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
threads blue in what i

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
heard and i think two areas for us to

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
kind of

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,639
get on the slide and and see at the same

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
time

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
so one was like different approaches

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
that can be taken both by an individual

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
like different backgrounds in

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
different fields or disciplines

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
and then kind of going beyond one

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
person's just learning trajectory

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
and thinking what are the

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,320
conceptual approaches that we can take

140
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,199
to in this case active inference

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
but this might be

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
studying active inference and applying

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
active inference kind of both ways might

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
come into play

145
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,039
and then the question of the first and

146
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
blankets

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,639
something like what aspects of what

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
enable

149
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
a situational realist

150
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,600
or a

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
instrumentalist

152
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
why are people taking the stances

153
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,700
they're taking

154
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,520
[Music]

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,240
on a given situation

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
sometimes even like

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
mixed across different contexts for the

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,039
same system they might use one or

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
another or something like that stephen

160
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
and this brings action back into the

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
equation i sense that action is is quite

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
important because

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
the idea of instrumentalism is in a way

164
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
is there's a use of

165
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,880
certain instruments um and that's that's

166
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,479
the best way

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
to think of what's happening with the

168
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
blankets actually i think it's really

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
cool that you brought the blankets up

170
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
because uh

171
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
that that question of

172
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
uh comes you know in an active way it's

173
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,599
like the the temptation is to make

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
everything realist and then it's like

175
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
okay we've got a blanket so it's kind of

176
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
like well

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
maybe we should make sure we keep the

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
blanket question in an instrumental way

179
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
to avoid all those traps and then on the

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
other side it's like

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
on the math side it's like well

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
these

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,680
potentially fundamental

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,000
dynamics

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
well as they're being acted in some way

186
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
they must have some relation to reality

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
in some way

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,479
so it's sort of almost the mirror

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,080
it's not the mirror but it's something

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
that's sitting on the other side

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,560
in an interesting way i don't know what

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,290
dean thinks from that point but um

193
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,479
[Music]

194
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
i i i

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
was going to mention that i

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
i think if we are taking two papers and

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
actually

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
doing

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,720
a bit of a what happens when they get

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
entangled thing we're looking at what

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
happens when something is actively

202
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,520
inferred as a process as opposed to

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
active inference as a subject matter or

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,039
topic

205
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,759
and so when we do that we're essentially

206
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,800
asking

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
what the big questions on one of the

208
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,280
next slide here is

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
so is active inference both as process

210
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
as actively inferring and of process

211
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,720
something falls out of that and we

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
we asked it in the in the using the

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,560
metaphor of being both a gripper

214
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
right something as processing and a

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,160
process being gripped and so um

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
yeah i think if we if we

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
if we actually look at it as what's

218
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,599
what's going on not just from the

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
doing sense but from the

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,958
observing sense or participatory sense

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
um

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
i think it leaves us with no choice but

223
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,839
to

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,480
say that there's got to be some

225
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
going back and forth between both but

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,839
that's just my

227
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,839
take

228
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
so let me let me read this quote from

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,839
the paper um specifically going back to

230
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
to the blanket the one that that set off

231
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
my my my question bell that's like

232
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
unanswered

233
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
um it says

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
um okay according to recent

235
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
interpretations of the fep the dynamical

236
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,440
interaction of living systems and the

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
external world under active inference

238
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
can be interpreted semantically this is

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
a ramstead 2020 citation by assuming

240
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,160
that sensory states are meaningful

241
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,680
representations of the reality

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
this is especially the case if we assume

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
that the development of markov blankets

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
by fristen

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
unlike their original characterization

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
and works of judea pearl on

247
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
probabilistic causal networks admit a

248
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
realist interpretation of the

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
relationship between the organism and

250
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
the environment

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
so it says while the role of the

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
concepts of markov blankets and pearl

253
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
blankets in many treatments of the free

254
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
energy principle is an instrumentalist

255
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
one whereas in pierce's even stronger

256
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,040
terms concede to a nominalist

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,959
interpretation of their meaning first in

258
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,640
blankets are realist not only in the

259
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,839
non-instrumentalist sense but also in

260
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,839
the sense of being non-nominalist

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
entities the modal terms of references

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
to real possibilities such as what is

263
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,279
conceivable or produced by imagination

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
or anticipatorially related to the

265
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
future states of affairs are used in

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
making sense of the key aspects of the

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
theory

268
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,640
um

269
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,600
and and so in my recollection the first

270
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
in blanket like i didn't have that

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
linked to

272
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,320
realism necessarily per se

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
so

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
daniel like maybe ken do you have any

275
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,000
more clarification like is that like a

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
realist a first time blanket is a

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,160
realist interpretation of the pearl

278
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,880
blanket or or am i just forgetting that

279
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
when i read that part

280
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,720
i didn't know what nominalism was

281
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,959
so according to the summary

282
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,880
the view that universals and abstract

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
objects do not actually exist other than

284
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
being merely

285
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,719
names or labels

286
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
one version denies the existence of

287
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,880
universals

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
the other the abstract so it's an

289
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,920
anti-generalist position so let's see

290
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
where that was used with the first and

291
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
blanket

292
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,450
because this is the um

293
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,959
[Music]

294
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,079
crux

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
of the discussion like one of the

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
frontiers of contact

297
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
other than just saying well an activism

298
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
and dynamical systems theory work like

299
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
this coarsely or this broad area math

300
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,800
and chemistry work together like this

301
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,959
this is starting to get into the real

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,240
contact points of

303
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
turf

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
semantically that are being

305
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
vied over people have different

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
perspectives on

307
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
how to interpret

308
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
base graphs in different contexts

309
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
and so then the markov blanket

310
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
it's like it still might even be too

311
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,279
coarse grained

312
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
for that whole turf to be

313
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
controlled by one view or another

314
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
so then

315
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,839
let's look at

316
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,399
how the abduction paper

317
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,399
and anything else that you

318
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,320
see

319
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
where would it be more justified just in

320
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
your sense

321
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,020
um

322
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,480
[Music]

323
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,120
what and then we'll unpack this because

324
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
i think this was just copied in to

325
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
discuss today

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
since it's obviously a clear area where

327
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
both papers are talking about their view

328
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
on the markup blanket which might make

329
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
it clearer

330
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,200
to see how multiple views on

331
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
blankets and graphs

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
come into play

333
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
but let's unpack both of their

334
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
perspectives

335
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
seeing the nominalist um

336
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,880
interpretation and as as you're

337
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
unpacking that like it's something i

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
didn't have to look up because it's a

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
very um prominent theme in buddhism

340
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
right like that um you know

341
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,160
it's like the absence of any kind of

342
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
inherent existence like that existence

343
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,639
is nominal

344
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,360
and so it's interesting that in this um

345
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
abduction paper

346
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
that

347
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
they take this this um

348
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
you know construction by pierce of

349
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
nominalism but but also like more than

350
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,160
once in that paper they

351
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
point to an objective reality uh which

352
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
is like if if things are interp

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
interpreted if all stuff is nominally

354
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
interpreted

355
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,839
then

356
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,040
um

357
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
what is this objective reality other

358
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,839
than like linguistics or semantics or

359
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,680
perhaps semiotics

360
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,880
um yeah so

361
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
even

362
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
that's a very good point um because it

363
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
also ties back you mentioned about um

364
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
when we're talking there about the

365
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,600
relationship almost being the reality i

366
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
sensed that they were kind of saying if

367
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
there's a relationship

368
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,199
those relational

369
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,279
dynamics or they didn't use the word

370
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
dynamics therefore

371
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880
have

372
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,680
some

373
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
can be called real you know

374
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,920
which i think is a fair assertion in

375
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,839
some senses

376
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,959
although

377
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
you know again

378
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,399
there could be an over extension because

379
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,199
there's a question about how much you go

380
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
up into transcendental

381
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,320
and how much you go down

382
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
into

383
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
the kind of more morphology and

384
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,079
the whole morphogenesis and there's

385
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,839
actually a really good there's a

386
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,320
hector lazar he's actually it does a lot

387
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
of work with theater of the oppressed

388
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
and worked with

389
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
you know people have been tortured and

390
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,160
stuff like that and he talks about

391
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
um the medicine is in the wounds the

392
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
medicine is in the wounds when people

393
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
get you know

394
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
trauma etc and one of the things that's

395
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
interesting there is that

396
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,720
we may be in a culture there's times

397
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,920
when we might try to explain things or

398
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,639
and do transcendental work

399
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,839
to to transcend a situation

400
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,920
or avoid us and we may actually avoid a

401
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
situation but sometimes when you go into

402
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
the wound

403
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,399
what you might find is is literally a

404
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
bloody mess

405
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,320
so

406
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
that may not be real in the normal sense

407
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,800
do you know

408
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
let's just add to that a little bit i

409
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
think it's interesting that most

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
representations of markov blankets show

411
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
the markov blanket

412
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,720
in between

413
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
two

414
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,120
two

415
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
distinct

416
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,959
um

417
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
sets of properties and that's always

418
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
represented on the horizontal

419
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
and i think what's interesting here is

420
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
that if if you

421
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,639
exactly if you find yourself

422
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,279
in a in a debate situation

423
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
of two top-down perspectives one that

424
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,199
says

425
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,040
it must be from the top down and active

426
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
or it must be from the top down some

427
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
some

428
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
series of

429
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,160
some series or set of different logics

430
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,959
applied depending upon your familiarity

431
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,920
with what it is that you're observing

432
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
that can lead to that whole question of

433
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,920
well

434
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
hierarchy and then what entails the

435
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
other so for me

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,920
um it's pretty it's pretty

437
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,880
easy to understand why

438
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
people who take

439
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,519
the exclusive position of

440
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,680
instrumentalism

441
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,079
as entailing

442
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,240
something like logic

443
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,039
or the other hierarchical

444
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
relationship of

445
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,760
the logic being the real thing

446
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
and then

447
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,919
the actions to follow or that's the

448
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
thing that's being entailed

449
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
i think what the diagrams a lot of the

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
pictures tell us is that there's a

451
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,120
lateral aspect to this as well

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,440
and so if we're going to

453
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
look at that lateral

454
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
less

455
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
which which is enveloping the other

456
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
top-down view because

457
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
both of the views in both of these

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
papers

459
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
the bias or the

460
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,960
the position that the authors take is

461
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
one of top down

462
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,640
what what rules

463
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,080
under this set of conditions or

464
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
circumstances

465
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,559
placing those two things side by each

466
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,120
strips away some of the questions around

467
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
relativity

468
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,840
and now introduces the idea of around

469
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
relationship not a relationship in terms

470
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,400
of power over

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
but relationship in terms of

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,799
what needs to be present in order for

473
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
somebody to be able to actually

474
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,840
make

475
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,160
fewer prediction errors

476
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,960
so

477
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,600
the markup blanket i think

478
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
can be

479
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,520
turned i mean right now most of it is is

480
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
perceived as being some sort of a

481
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,799
vertical partition between

482
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,559
lateral

483
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,360
elements i mean it can be flipped and

484
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,840
we've talked often in lots of papers

485
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
about what's the hierarchical structure

486
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
what's the bottom up what's the top down

487
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,679
but i think both of these papers

488
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
admittedly say

489
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,160
we are taking a top-down view of this

490
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,840
and therefore they are constraining

491
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,600
themselves to

492
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,918
more

493
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
emphasis on the relativity aspect of

494
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
what is going on in it in an actively

495
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
inferring way than they are looking at

496
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,679
it as a relationship between the sensing

497
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,480
and the acting

498
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,840
all right wow a lot of stuff

499
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
let's go through the abduction

500
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,919
markov blanket discussion

501
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
the first part is the statement of

502
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
context potentially for a philosophical

503
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
background but it's important that

504
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
they're placing this

505
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,360
along the lines of

506
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,919
autopoiesis and biology so these are

507
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
systems that are self perpetuating

508
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
in a diffusive multi-scale self-way

509
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,480
perhaps

510
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
but they're self-creating we're not just

511
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
taking them as existing

512
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,360
in a certain contrived arrangement five

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
minutes ago we're thinking about systems

514
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
that have

515
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
maintained a non-equilibrium steady

516
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
state with their environments

517
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
and if not the enviro if someone denies

518
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
the realism or the anything

519
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,039
um of the environment

520
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,720
then that

521
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
can be verbalized and even cognized but

522
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,120
it is not enacted by persistent systems

523
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,679
either from the view from the inside

524
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,760
or like if one just

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
stops breathing or something like that

526
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
or the view from the outside because

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
again systems with persistent

528
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,840
measurements

529
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,679
have to be at least

530
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,080
doing well enough to persist

531
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
amidst the regularities of the

532
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
environment

533
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
so this is kind of like grounding it in

534
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,840
an evolutionary and developmental

535
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
framework but connecting it to the

536
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,760
non-equilibrium steady state maintenance

537
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
which is grounding this realism

538
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
discussion in a relationship with the

539
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
environment

540
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
not as like in a priori

541
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
then there's a definition of markov

542
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
blanket

543
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
the blanket state conditional

544
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,520
independence between nodes in a base

545
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
graph which doesn't mean that influence

546
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
doesn't travel or that those states

547
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
aren't semantically about each other

548
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
but it means that they're conditionally

549
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
independent in a statistical way

550
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,159
external states

551
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,320
in sabosku not sure this author but the

552
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
endosomic view

553
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
would be like

554
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,440
potentially meaning on the inside like

555
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
photons on the retina really are light

556
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
it really is the case that that's the

557
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
real thing

558
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,120
within that facet of biological function

559
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
and internal states described from

560
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,039
exosemiotic perspective so perhaps like

561
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
the interpretive view so view from the

562
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,919
inside the true influence of of a

563
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,960
feature

564
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
and the kind of studying of it view from

565
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
the outside where those agree

566
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,240
you have semiosis like with a stop sign

567
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
and it means stop

568
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,280
in the situation with different entities

569
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,919
this speaks directly to active inference

570
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
given that the regulation of the entropy

571
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
of internal states so all these

572
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
functions that we're describing as being

573
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
like bounded or constrained or minimized

574
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
are having to do with

575
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,360
that interface's surprise control on

576
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,159
action outgoing and then bounded

577
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,039
surprise on perception which is

578
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
also very force aged by like the

579
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,679
perceptual control theory and various

580
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,480
motor theories which we've talked about

581
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,960
but like the reflex arc

582
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,679
challenging the way that people

583
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,480
modeled decision making

584
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,320
for example

585
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
then

586
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
um in many treatments they're

587
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
agreeing that people take an

588
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
instrumentalist usage

589
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
or stance

590
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,559
christian blankets are realist not only

591
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,320
in the non-instrumentalists sense

592
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
opens up a whole discussion with non and

593
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
anti

594
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,760
but also in the sense of being

595
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,000
non-nominalist entities

596
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,280
and then in this last quote

597
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
um

598
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,240
it'd be great to hear more from the

599
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,559
authors about what the modal terms of

600
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,880
reference are but the part that stands

601
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,799
out here is the real possibilities

602
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
because for these systems

603
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,000
with these features engaging in this way

604
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
their

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,919
cognition can be considered real

606
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
to the extent it has all of these

607
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
features and is tied to the environment

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,960
over time and so on

609
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,159
hope that

610
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,640
is one view on it because many

611
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
paragraphs in the abductive paper and

612
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,600
inactive paper

613
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
if you really engage with their

614
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
structured arguments there's so much to

615
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
like read in between

616
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,600
and

617
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,440
to respect the way that they've laid out

618
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
the argument while also

619
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
hopefully now all seeing

620
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
interesting ways to connect it so

621
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,520
stephen and then anyone else

622
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
yeah this is a little bit

623
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
sort of feeding back to you daniel so in

624
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
case you've got a thought on this but

625
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,200
because

626
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
the

627
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
you know the there's the there's the the

628
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
biological aspect here that you're

629
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
bringing up and i agree with that

630
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,720
and

631
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
you know in the work on the brain

632
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
tristan's been talking about

633
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
moving from say a causal correlation to

634
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
a functional correlation

635
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,360
and there can be many ways of getting

636
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
somewhere when it's functional

637
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
so then but of course in this case

638
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,879
there's a certain element of

639
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
what's real in terms of what we

640
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
scientifically because it's scientific

641
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,760
realism as a scientist what is really

642
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
what's been scientifically deducted

643
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
so if it's been deductive it is a

644
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
perspective that's being taken so within

645
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,559
the perspective that's being taken on

646
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,080
certain

647
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
states non-equilibrium steady states

648
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
where is

649
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,159
that

650
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
regime of attention the scientific

651
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,080
regime of attention

652
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,880
purely an instrument to be considered or

653
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,760
is it

654
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,000
for the things that it's analyzing that

655
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,679
could be real

656
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
so there could be sort of a get out

657
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,720
clause

658
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,039
yet there could still be

659
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
phenomenon

660
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
rather than

661
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,480
perspectives and logic

662
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
sitting underneath that which have

663
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
many dynamics to get to the same

664
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
outcome so what's your thoughts on that

665
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,678
daniel

666
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
my thoughts i want to hear what blue and

667
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
dean would say on it okay come on

668
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,400
oh yeah steve first

669
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
go ahead go ahead blue

670
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
now go for it dean i want to hear what

671
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
you have to say okay well

672
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,039
so here here's an interesting thing

673
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
about both papers and maybe maybe the

674
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
authors of the papers will push back

675
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
hard on this but great that's what i'm

676
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,080
used to

677
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,919
both papers take a scientific

678
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,520
perspective on this

679
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
very much is my typical perspective

680
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,279
which in my books is easily

681
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
as an idiom is

682
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,679
when i see it i'll believe it they want

683
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
the evidence right they want it they

684
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
want that sort of inductive deductive

685
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
piece to sort of sit front and center

686
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
they want proof

687
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
which is great i get that but what i

688
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
think is really fascinating about this

689
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
is while they are

690
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
holding up

691
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
that

692
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,799
that epistemic

693
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,200
priority they're also talking a lot

694
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
about

695
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
i'll they invert that and they say i'll

696
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,799
believe it

697
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
when i see it

698
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
so there's a lot of faith in this it

699
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,039
hasn't materialized yet but if i

700
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,200
continue to exist

701
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,799
in a social setting

702
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,279
or as an agent

703
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,000
guess what i gotta have faith that all

704
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
this time that keeps

705
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,200
rolling out

706
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,640
i'm going to continue

707
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
for whatever purposes goals or

708
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,640
directives i'm taking

709
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
to

710
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
work through

711
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
the not seeing it

712
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
until i actually

713
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
arrive at that moment where something

714
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,840
materializes and i can say oh

715
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,640
now i have the evidence so there's a

716
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
both papers have a real

717
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
they play they play with themselves they

718
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,039
dance with themselves in the sense that

719
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,039
they are both papers from an explicit

720
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,960
standpoint saying we we are looking at

721
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,679
the scientifically and mathematically

722
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
and yet in order for us to be able to

723
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
hold on to this

724
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,520
this

725
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,880
this thought or idea of the fpp being

726
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,720
um

727
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
you know i'm i'm i'm i'm

728
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
i'm whatever called steady state i've

729
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,480
just lost the expression non-equilibrium

730
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,880
thank you non-equilibrium state state i

731
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,440
do have to believe in something in order

732
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
for whatever materialization goal or

733
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,279
outcome i'm i'm moving towards if that's

734
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,720
homeostasis or allostasis or i want to

735
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
sandwich five minutes from now i have to

736
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,120
believe in that thing or my agency or my

737
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,679
ability to achieve or attain

738
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
before i can actually

739
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,720
have the thing

740
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
so

741
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,399
from from from that view alone

742
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
i find it really interesting that

743
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,039
there's a certain amount of naivete

744
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
in both papers there's a kind of a we

745
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,559
have to tip our hat to this rookie view

746
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
that every time we

747
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,559
realize something

748
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,279
there has to be a little bit of faith or

749
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,360
a little bit of belief

750
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,760
in what's going on those priors actually

751
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,399
exist and i'm going to use them

752
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,640
because i want to carry out whatever my

753
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
priorities are

754
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
and it doesn't matter

755
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
whether it's the top downiness of

756
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,640
abduction and logic or the top downiness

757
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,240
of an activism

758
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
they both tip their hat to the bottom

759
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,679
uppiness

760
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,840
i gotta kind of have a i gotta kind of

761
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,799
have a

762
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
confidence that

763
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,919
that even if it's not here now at some

764
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,120
point

765
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
it will either continue the way i want

766
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
it to or whatever change i want to

767
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,840
impose on it i have that capacity to

768
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,360
wait it out and have that thing happen

769
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,640
so

770
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
yeah that's what i would add to what

771
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
stephen was saying

772
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,600
okay

773
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,720
yes so

774
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,600
so

775
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
i i'll say a couple things um

776
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,159
i was looking at just now the difference

777
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,840
between a

778
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
first and like what is the first in

779
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,120
blanket and i came across a paper that

780
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,559
we're going to have to discuss uh it's

781
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,120
called scientific realism about first in

782
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,799
blankets without literalism and it's by

783
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,600
kimberstein and kirk kirchoff

784
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
um so someday we're gonna have to have

785
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,880
that it's a pre-print up on

786
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
philosophical archive now so so

787
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,039
apparently like having a real

788
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,679
boundary can be like literal like

789
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,600
there's like a literal interpretation or

790
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
a realist interpretation and and so just

791
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
like i'm still trying to narrow down

792
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,159
like what is this realist interpretation

793
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,960
of a fristen blanket um

794
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,679
and

795
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,799
yeah

796
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,840
so

797
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,480
it in also a very real sense like what

798
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,600
is the real boundary of a living thing

799
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
um like

800
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,679
i don't i can't find my real boundary

801
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
like where do i stop and something else

802
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,960
begins um there are like hundreds and

803
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,120
like trillions i don't even know more

804
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
non-human cells in my body than there

805
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
are human cells like so i always have to

806
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
come back to this so what would i be

807
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,720
without all of those non-human things

808
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
are those non-human things also me like

809
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,360
but then like you know i'm constantly

810
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,159
like

811
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,159
ingesting new ones and excreting old

812
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,640
ones and and so like and they're coming

813
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
into my skin and leaving my skin so

814
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,919
where is my

815
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,519
boundary like do i have to have this

816
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,080
boundary in order for active inference

817
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
and like the markov blanket

818
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,279
interpretation to apply i i don't know

819
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,480
that that's

820
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,600
um

821
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,840
necessarily true

822
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,120
so

823
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
like i can just get off of it i love

824
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,840
this paper and i love like the semiotic

825
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,240
interpretation in like the abductive

826
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,720
sense like but does it even really

827
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
matter like like

828
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,120
so the realest interpretation like to

829
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,880
someone who doesn't believe in like a

830
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
shared objective reality is never going

831
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,720
to work

832
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
or like can you find the boundary like

833
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
what is this line between self and other

834
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
or like between

835
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,559
like like i can't find the boundary so

836
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
like for me it's all a modeling

837
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
perspective um that doesn't lessen the

838
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,720
impact of

839
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,799
this abduction as active inference paper

840
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,360
for me at all like like i really thought

841
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,200
it was a great paper and has a lot of

842
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
really cool things to say about

843
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,320
cognition and perception so

844
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,399
like why are we hung up on this still i

845
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,719
don't know

846
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,600
okay both of you go for it and then i'll

847
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,919
add some notes

848
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
could i just add one more

849
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
i mean i think what

850
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
i agree with totally with dean on this

851
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
this bottom-up

852
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
phenomenon you know that's that's going

853
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,080
to be there in the background right

854
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
maybe it's always going to be unknowable

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,919
apart from some of these simulations

856
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
giving us insights but

857
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
i think also what blue is saying there

858
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,919
is for me

859
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,640
this whole boundary question

860
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,159
is where there's the problem with the

861
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,760
systems

862
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,120
discussion

863
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,720
in terms of that being kind of

864
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,399
naturalized

865
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,120
and i think that it because you end up

866
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
with because systems are defined that

867
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,440
way what's inside what's outside

868
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,399
and for me the big revelation

869
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,919
and i think for a lot of people maybe in

870
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
the biological sciences

871
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,679
it's not so unusual to think this way

872
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,399
but to think about agent-based modelling

873
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,320
to think about where's the agent where's

874
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,760
the agency the teleology

875
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,559
and

876
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
that

877
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,360
agency doesn't necessarily sit on a

878
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
boundary

879
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,919
in the same way that systems tend to

880
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
i mean someone can argue that it doesn't

881
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,120
have to and i'm sure it doesn't but it

882
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,200
ends it nearly always ends up there

883
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,159
right in reality in terms of discourse

884
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,480
so um you know we want that discourse to

885
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,679
be clear we're doing this work with

886
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,360
systems engineering to have it where we

887
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,600
want these clear divisions for the

888
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,080
purpose of ontological discourse so we

889
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
know what we're talking about and why

890
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,679
however

891
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,760
which is where maybe there's a challenge

892
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
this agent

893
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,360
agency teleology morphological

894
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,240
um dynamics are

895
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,880
something else than that and i'll pass

896
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
that to daniel and maybe his ants will

897
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
come in somewhere i'm not sure

898
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
dean first then i'll go for it i'll be

899
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
real quick here so in some of the

900
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,918
diagrams i know

901
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
daniel you're you're really good at this

902
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
some of the diagrams the markov blanket

903
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,079
is literally a an oval with the word

904
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,000
discrepancy

905
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
in it

906
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,918
and so all i would do to

907
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,918
to add on to what blue was saying is

908
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,800
that

909
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,199
if you want a hard physical boundary and

910
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,079
you want to discover what that is

911
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,719
um i think you're looking at it again

912
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,599
what

913
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,159
where is this where is does one thing

914
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
end and another thing start as a

915
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
relativity question what i'm suggesting

916
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,480
is

917
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
if you're looking at the bottom up and

918
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,359
the top down as a relationship not as a

919
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,719
which is which is more powerful or holds

920
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,719
more influence over the other you're

921
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
looking at that as a relationship then

922
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
it's that relationship

923
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,680
holds

924
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,839
as a discrepancy zone

925
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,480
it's not necessarily something that has

926
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,920
a physical

927
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,880
beginning and end it's kind of

928
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
it's kind of fluid

929
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
and it

930
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,400
and this is not to say we shouldn't look

931
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,280
at the relativity piece at all it is to

932
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
say let's have one eye on the relativity

933
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,599
piece and the other eye on the

934
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,079
relationship piece the discrepancy

935
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,720
between it doesn't it doesn't

936
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
lend itself to hard

937
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
stops

938
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
it's discrepancy if that's all that is

939
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
that's just

940
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,720
what it is it means

941
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
we're not sure

942
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
about anything other than they're

943
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,560
different

944
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
we don't know

945
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,880
where

946
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
where the separation boundary is but

947
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,640
that's kind of where this whole let's

948
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
bring these two papers together thing

949
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
came from because

950
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,200
if we're actively inferring

951
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,320
we we can bound around that discrepancy

952
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,800
it doesn't always have to be a partition

953
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
that's what the

954
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
that's what the affordance is here

955
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
potentially if we can have

956
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
two things

957
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
being held simultaneously or

958
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,400
co-currently

959
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,160
all right wow well

960
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
a lot there well first with the

961
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,040
discrepancies textbook figure two three

962
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,800
discrepancy

963
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
not a blanket or discrepancy as blanket

964
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
of blanket etc

965
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
and

966
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that can be a continuous or discrete

967
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,079
value but in non-idealized

968
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,800
like non-singular path of least action

969
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
settings

970
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,720
aka real settings there's always a

971
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
non-zero value

972
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
so that's one way to leave the door

973
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
always a little open

974
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,400
in a way that

975
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
just having two feet on

976
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
zero or one

977
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
or any rapid switching strategies of

978
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
zeros and ones doesn't really capture

979
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
that

980
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
in the same way

981
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,400
then blue great question like

982
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
we asked a little bit about at the

983
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
beginning

984
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,480
why what is leading someone to consider

985
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,680
something

986
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,400
uh

987
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
like a blanket in a realist or an

988
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
instrumentalist light

989
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
and pointed to factors like the

990
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,000
persistence of the organism and the

991
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
reality of like the action in flow with

992
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
its environment so kind of forces

993
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,880
somebody to say well if the environment

994
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,200
is real then the entity and the actions

995
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,119
and the semiosis of their actions are

996
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,440
real if stop signs are real and stopping

997
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,280
at a stop sign is real and they're all

998
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
part of a non-equilibrium steady state

999
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
what what further

1000
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
realism does one want to know than that

1001
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,720
like there is a territory

1002
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
and then this is the maps of the

1003
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,000
territory so someone going to go all the

1004
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
way into territory

1005
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,359
skepticism

1006
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,359
or how will they then reframe their

1007
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,560
stance

1008
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,839
um

1009
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,000
then

1010
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,079
on the just a few other random pieces

1011
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,320
this was in live stream three

1012
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,440
when we read about communication

1013
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,359
in active inference

1014
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,920
and they are which is a lot of in the

1015
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,640
social inaction setting that we're

1016
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
bringing this abductive

1017
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
light to the social and active setting

1018
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,119
that's really like

1019
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,680
expounded upon in the hippolyta and van

1020
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,560
s paper that that goes into a lot of the

1021
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,280
scientific and philosophical aspects of

1022
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
social

1023
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
um so here

1024
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
they're

1025
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,680
borrowing from the framework of tim

1026
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,320
bergen's four questions

1027
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,839
and providing

1028
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:34,880
multiple

1029
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,720
scales of analysis

1030
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
that are all like the four y's

1031
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,800
and these four y's are kind of like a

1032
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,760
two by two quadrant

1033
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,040
and so then that allows in

1034
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,560
biology

1035
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
parallel research agendas

1036
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,680
and integration

1037
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
because like the fact that brain regions

1038
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,880
are connected to each other up here on

1039
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,960
the mechanism side

1040
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,200
is part of the picture but it's a yes

1041
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,000
and with the pattern of

1042
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,240
dna divergence times like you could

1043
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,839
imagine situations where they're

1044
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,760
correlated or not and they could be

1045
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
causated or not and it could be either

1046
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
way of causation or a confounding factor

1047
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
or any other number of things

1048
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,480
and then neither of those have a direct

1049
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,720
closed door on like what the bird song

1050
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,960
sounds like so without even going into

1051
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
what the bird song is like interpreted

1052
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
as there still

1053
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
is space within that

1054
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,320
interpretive or semiotic scientific

1055
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
approach

1056
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,440
that

1057
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,720
is

1058
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,160
hopefully as we can explore

1059
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,520
considering

1060
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,119
the research and the application

1061
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,560
in a different way than it's been

1062
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
partitioned

1063
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,240
in certain specific analyses in the past

1064
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
dean

1065
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,520
well

1066
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
so here i'll i'll throw something out

1067
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
there knowing that i have not really

1068
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,119
thought about it more than while i was

1069
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,720
listening to you talking

1070
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,800
so if it's completely wrong

1071
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
somebody can can correct me really

1072
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
quickly i think it's really interesting

1073
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,359
that

1074
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,440
both of these papers

1075
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,720
provide what i would consider to be as a

1076
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,040
stable or a stabilizing effect on

1077
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,319
what

1078
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,560
we might describe as

1079
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
something resembling strategy

1080
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
for the potential for strategy

1081
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,720
what i'm always thinking about is the

1082
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,359
strategy is not behavior behaviors

1083
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,040
usually given the label tactics

1084
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,920
but but strategy does include the

1085
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,319
anticipation and the logic that is

1086
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,680
applied and i think that's where

1087
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,280
we're not in conflict when we say

1088
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,400
there's a triadic and there's a

1089
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,119
co-construction of the social scene

1090
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,000
because i think both of those things

1091
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,160
provide the still stability or the

1092
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,200
platform then to strategize

1093
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
and minimize those prediction errors

1094
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,280
so

1095
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,440
again we can still we can still build

1096
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,599
off of strategy and do

1097
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,839
and we can still build off of strategy

1098
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,480
and eliminate

1099
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,400
constant bad consequential decisions

1100
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,440
so

1101
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,240
again that's the relationship as as

1102
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,520
opposed to

1103
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,000
which one of these two approaches these

1104
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,560
two top down approaches

1105
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,400
is the is the thing that holds the most

1106
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,000
sway because at any given time

1107
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,400
one or the other or both as long as you

1108
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,319
don't get trapped

1109
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,280
in one

1110
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
would actually be the most i would think

1111
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,119
would be the most option generating not

1112
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,119
option selected because they talk in the

1113
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,800
induction paper about

1114
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
the different types

1115
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,400
of abduction

1116
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
but they do heavily emphasize also that

1117
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,760
in the end both of those types the

1118
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
generating and the selecting

1119
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,280
are essentially

1120
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
you you can't you can't have one without

1121
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,720
the other

1122
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,440
so

1123
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,800
that's an interesting thing to

1124
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,280
incorporate here as well

1125
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,200
or you need to consider i'm not saying

1126
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,440
you have to take it up

1127
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,200
but if you did what would that look like

1128
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,920
i'll just directly respond a few pieces

1129
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,000
there then steven than anyone else so

1130
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
very interesting connection with

1131
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
multi-scale

1132
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
prediction error or free energy

1133
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,960
minimization uncertainty reduction

1134
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
surprisal bounding

1135
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,720
in multi-scale systems

1136
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,440
and then in this social inactive setting

1137
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,480
that

1138
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,319
hippolyta and van ness brought to the

1139
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,920
forefront

1140
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,440
that is

1141
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,480
our gripper and gripped

1142
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,920
in a way that a little

1143
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,440
experiment

1144
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
on a fixed mirror active inference

1145
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,640
system or system described by any of the

1146
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,560
conventional mechanics

1147
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,280
classical physics mechanics statistical

1148
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,440
thermodynamics quantum

1149
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,760
kind of just going off on a

1150
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
prelude to

1151
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
upcoming discussions with dalton

1152
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,599
but i think that we'll pull out an

1153
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,040
aspect which is that the bayesian

1154
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
mechanics

1155
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,280
broadens that discussion into the

1156
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,760
cognitive dynamics

1157
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
of active particles

1158
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,000
and so in that way a ball falling

1159
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,920
becomes like a special case of active

1160
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
particles falling

1161
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,359
that could take various paths based upon

1162
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
their embodied affordances

1163
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
even if just described as if like the

1164
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,640
baseball is not following the parabola

1165
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,920
equation but that's how the real

1166
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,480
environment and active particle interact

1167
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
which is to say semiotically which is

1168
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,040
why they both

1169
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,359
papers mention abduction in the social

1170
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,040
context

1171
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,599
and then you mentioned like these two

1172
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,640
top-down perspectives

1173
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,200
and how when we have the divergence

1174
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,599
between among like multi three body

1175
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,079
problem we have multiple ideas minimum

1176
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,280
of two

1177
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
hopefully more

1178
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
and then there are strange attractors

1179
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,200
there's

1180
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,720
there's live stream 32 there's

1181
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,839
livestream 26 everything happens in that

1182
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,319
space from the top down

1183
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,920
because there's always going to be a

1184
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,000
plurality from the bottom up

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,319
so the one error that

1186
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,280
wouldn't

1187
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,680
just be the right coarse graining for

1188
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,720
sure

1189
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
is a singular

1190
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
eye of mordor

1191
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,200
laser

1192
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,599
and that leads to

1193
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,640
basically the unexpected unexpecteds

1194
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,760
with the reality of the bottom up

1195
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,520
and then when there's divergences and

1196
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,920
continuous state spaces and paths in

1197
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,880
between top down

1198
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,960
then there's a bi-directional

1199
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,119
relationship with the top down and the

1200
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,720
bottom up or the inside out and the

1201
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,880
outside in because you could even move

1202
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,720
amongst those without feeling like we

1203
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,200
were like violating a system

1204
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
to sometimes use a left to right for

1205
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,560
time and then we could use right to left

1206
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,119
for time and so seeing those kinds of

1207
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,520
cognitive moves as accessible

1208
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
in a social setting

1209
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,880
and then cut tying that course lastly to

1210
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,560
you said that the two-stroke engine of

1211
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,760
abduction with generating and selecting

1212
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,599
because the laser is not a generator

1213
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,200
and that's the now the analogy of

1214
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,319
attention

1215
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,480
in a talk down system like we've seen

1216
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,359
modeled and mental action

1217
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,640
several times stephen

1218
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,280
yeah thanks daniel um

1219
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,880
would you be able to go back to that

1220
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,000
four by four that you had there um

1221
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
with the ultimate yeah and

1222
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,760
i think that this is really important

1223
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,119
because

1224
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,599
there's also this implicit enlightenment

1225
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,760
assumption that was always sitting in

1226
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,680
the background

1227
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,599
where up is good

1228
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,560
and

1229
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,000
i think it's really interesting there

1230
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
that and i think you're absolutely right

1231
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
we talk about it talks about ultimate

1232
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
which i think is really curious and it

1233
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,280
talks about you know we talk about this

1234
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,000
interactions so this kind of interaction

1235
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
this is the ultimate set of interactions

1236
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,839
the robin and

1237
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,079
that is what the truth is seen as what's

1238
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,000
the rational truth

1239
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,640
when we go up and we get enlightened so

1240
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,560
then we can project down

1241
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,319
on what's there and the idea of that

1242
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,400
what's coming up is

1243
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,640
interactions that's the general way it's

1244
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,400
thought and there was this magic box

1245
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,640
called emergence to sort of get around

1246
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,400
the fact that really we didn't know

1247
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,599
but i would i would challenge that

1248
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,480
not not to say that's that's not true in

1249
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
terms of how it's perceived but

1250
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
there's another way that bottom up can

1251
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,920
be explored and that is another way that

1252
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,760
truth can be explored there's there's

1253
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
rational truth

1254
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,040
and there's

1255
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,760
which i thought ultimate is quite i get

1256
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,359
the sense that that is

1257
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,760
very much looking out as this

1258
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,920
uh it's in built into those words right

1259
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
this assumption that of enlightenment

1260
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,599
but there's also intimate truth

1261
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,760
intimate truth

1262
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,240
is different to rational truth

1263
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,319
and intimate truth is not about

1264
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,680
interactions it's about knowing

1265
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,640
okay

1266
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,359
it's about a deeper kind of knowing

1267
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,520
so when i go down it's not

1268
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,240
what's coming up in a bottom up

1269
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,079
it's what am i going

1270
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
well my only way to engage it is to go

1271
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,480
down into it does that make sense

1272
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,720
and that going down into it

1273
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,119
is also valuable

1274
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,760
it is not more primitive

1275
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
than enlightenment

1276
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,119
and i think that

1277
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,240
um

1278
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
that that goes to sort of a very

1279
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
foundational assumption which we don't

1280
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,760
even notice it's there about science

1281
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,040
that everything's trying to be

1282
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,880
enlightened but that

1283
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,640
is only partially true and i think

1284
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,520
biology sort of knows that but maybe

1285
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
can't speak to it anyway that's that's

1286
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,319
my little piece there

1287
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,760
to

1288
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,960
try to connect that one layer closer to

1289
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,880
i think some academic traditions but by

1290
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
no mean

1291
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,920
uh

1292
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,680
normed ones but thanks for everybody for

1293
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,800
sharing those

1294
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,640
it um reminds me of the direction taken

1295
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,920
in the

1296
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,160
uh one of the biographies i'll paste in

1297
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,680
the title here

1298
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,240
this is um evelyn fox keller's biography

1299
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,640
of barbara mcclintock

1300
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,319
and the title is a feeling for the

1301
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,240
organism

1302
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,400
and uh

1303
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,240
that

1304
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,440
takes a

1305
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,680
history and philosophy of science

1306
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,920
informed view like what is the feeling

1307
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,319
for the organism

1308
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,920
how does one have a feeling for the

1309
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,240
chromosomes like this belief that there

1310
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,640
were jumping genes

1311
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,680
from

1312
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,480
certain psychological um observations

1313
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,440
and then

1314
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,960
how does that really play out when

1315
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
somebody is in a context

1316
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,880
of professionalism and like expectations

1317
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,160
around different people who look

1318
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,079
different and so on

1319
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,559
so that takes a a holistic look and i

1320
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,359
think there is that on this every or

1321
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,880
many cases

1322
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,440
that kind of story to tell

1323
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,400
and so

1324
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,880
that is one bridge of connection

1325
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,200
blue

1326
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,280
from like the evolution standpoint and i

1327
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,720
think um

1328
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,599
like

1329
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,280
part of the question that stephen asked

1330
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,599
earlier like can we take multiple

1331
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,000
trajectories be it like top down bottom

1332
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,640
up to arrive at the same

1333
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,559
conclusion or the same like end point

1334
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,599
um

1335
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,440
and this is something like in evolution

1336
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,359
there's like convergent evolution where

1337
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,440
you know completely different

1338
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,680
genetically unrelated species will

1339
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,319
arrive at the same trait or or develop a

1340
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,400
very similar appearance that makes

1341
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
people think like you know before we had

1342
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
dna relationships like we

1343
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,760
had species lumped together because of

1344
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,960
their similar appearance that were

1345
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,839
actually

1346
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,000
completely like unrelated like or very

1347
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,680
distant on the phylogenetics scale

1348
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,640
um so so like it's an adaptation that we

1349
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,880
converge on the same feature or we

1350
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,359
converge to the same argument or the

1351
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,319
same

1352
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,240
like place in some kind of space

1353
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,839
and this is something that i think about

1354
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,599
a lot um

1355
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,079
and just going to like the the quantum

1356
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,280
perspective

1357
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,680
like can we you know

1358
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,839
all go from you know point a to point

1359
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,240
like traversing a different trajectory

1360
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,160
but like if everything is time

1361
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,319
reversible then that's not really

1362
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,800
possible like we can't converge to the

1363
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,200
same point like we have to follow a

1364
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
specific path

1365
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,598
if time reversibility holds true

1366
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,760
sorry had to just like throw that in

1367
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,599
there

1368
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,040
interesting uh

1369
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,960
no let's kind of return to some of our

1370
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,480
earlier

1371
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,440
frameworks but

1372
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,119
fun stuff i guess

1373
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,000
um

1374
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,520
we knew we wanted to cover the mark on

1375
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,920
blanket we have

1376
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,520
explored

1377
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,880
some of the

1378
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,680
threads that justify

1379
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,480
the

1380
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,559
realist or even

1381
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,319
further stance

1382
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,680
though we still have a lot of questions

1383
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,839
from the last 20 minutes or whatever

1384
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,000
about like what leads somebody and what

1385
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
the implications are for being different

1386
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,520
stances causes and consequences of

1387
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,359
different stances why does that matter

1388
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,760
in general studying crystallography why

1389
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,400
does that matter for the social setting

1390
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,319
like decision making and governance or

1391
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,319
organization

1392
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,760
that was a justification broadly

1393
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
for abduction's

1394
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,599
capacity

1395
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,480
to be compatible with active inference

1396
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,440
and form a type of probably valuable

1397
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,680
relationship both directions because

1398
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,599
active inference gains these cognitive

1399
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,640
features

1400
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,200
that were described before base graphs

1401
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,319
were invented

1402
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,880
analogous to kind of blue's suggestion

1403
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,640
that there was classifications that were

1404
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,559
some were really insightful others were

1405
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,440
false clumpings or lumpings or whatever

1406
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,960
before there was a way to look at it

1407
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,200
differently

1408
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,440
that is some of what grounds

1409
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
a realist interpretation though again

1410
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
we're still not fully closed on what it

1411
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,880
means to be realist or why it matters

1412
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,160
but now let's go to the mark off blanket

1413
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,800
inaction concept

1414
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,079
and similarly break down their

1415
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,200
angle on the blanket

1416
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,480
and understand maybe what leads them and

1417
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,319
what their suggested implications are

1418
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,800
for that stance

1419
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,559
what kind of a person do they think

1420
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,640
they're being by taking this

1421
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,280
cognitive social position

1422
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
which could be asked of both papers and

1423
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,680
all uh speech action

1424
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,559
and then um

1425
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,400
where's the beef

1426
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,720
then

1427
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,640
what is the

1428
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,839
what is the between

1429
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,599
there so anyone can go for it

1430
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,200
what is um

1431
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,960
something to bring in about an action

1432
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,599
blankets

1433
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,520
and or how

1434
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,599
everything is brought together

1435
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,839
in hippolyta and vanessa 21.

1436
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,440
yes dean yeah go take your time

1437
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,280
so one of the things that i really like

1438
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,960
about this paper is again it's

1439
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,119
the time it takes

1440
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,000
and that they heavily emphasize

1441
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,800
that

1442
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,079
as part of this co-construction

1443
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,520
that that

1444
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,319
enables people to gain some sense of

1445
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,119
what

1446
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,760
it means to be in a now

1447
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,319
social situation in fact they they talk

1448
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,280
about

1449
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,800
and i'm not sure where it is in the

1450
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,400
paper but they talk about the fact that

1451
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,079
people that are that are um

1452
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,160
new to a cultural setting

1453
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,880
it requires of them

1454
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,839
some

1455
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:34,880
time

1456
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,720
in order for them to be able to pick up

1457
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,799
on the non-linguistic

1458
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,280
non-verbal

1459
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,799
non-expressed information that's being

1460
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,359
passed within that social realm and that

1461
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,440
they're not picking up on

1462
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,960
so

1463
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,240
so what

1464
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,359
what enables that and that's

1465
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,880
then when they spend a little bit of

1466
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,079
time sort of

1467
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,000
talking out

1468
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,040
why that could only be then considered a

1469
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,920
co-construction the more you do

1470
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,440
within that condition the more you pick

1471
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,160
up you can't simply be

1472
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,680
watching you can't

1473
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,599
in fact the transition is going from

1474
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,839
spectator to

1475
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,000
actual doer and so that's that's a heavy

1476
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,839
that's a heavy burden

1477
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,359
to put on

1478
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,720
the statistical

1479
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,240
landscape

1480
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,839
because you don't sort of sit there and

1481
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,400
go okay so what's the probability that

1482
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,520
this person who i can't really

1483
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,559
understand because i don't even want

1484
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,240
length don't even know what they're

1485
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,200
saying because they're speaking a

1486
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,799
different language

1487
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,480
what's the problem like you don't sit

1488
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
there and kind of

1489
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,880
do those kind of calculations or maybe

1490
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,920
you do

1491
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,160
but you're just not aware of it and

1492
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,799
you're not spending a whole lot of time

1493
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,880
with your calculator out

1494
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
trying to figure out what the what the

1495
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,480
distribution is

1496
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,400
while you are trying to

1497
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,920
co-construct

1498
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,839
or co-coordinate

1499
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,079
your

1500
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,799
your active involvement in this new

1501
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,319
thing that you're now

1502
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,359
trying to

1503
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,040
be a part of

1504
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,079
so

1505
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,520
that's one of the arguments that i

1506
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,040
really like about

1507
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,000
their paper they basically say in order

1508
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,720
for this to work first thing we have to

1509
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,839
appreciate is that there is a temporal

1510
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,599
commitment

1511
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,319
to making anything happen

1512
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,079
going forward you could if you don't

1513
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,079
have that temporal commitment if you

1514
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,680
check out before you've even checked in

1515
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,240
nothing changes nothing happens

1516
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,760
so

1517
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,760
from a markup blanket standpoint that

1518
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,280
that essentially goes back to the

1519
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,880
discrepancy question is it is it is it a

1520
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,640
hard boundary well you can perceive it

1521
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,720
that way there's this limitation now

1522
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,760
because i don't speak their language

1523
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,880
or

1524
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,960
you can look at it as now what is this

1525
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,920
what is this evolving discrepancy and

1526
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,480
how does it change how does it shift how

1527
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,440
does it deviate and then re-conform

1528
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,599
eventually oscillating down to some sort

1529
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,240
of

1530
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,760
agreement

1531
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,400
that is the instrumental piece

1532
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,760
i'm just saying most people aren't

1533
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
sitting there calculating that out as

1534
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,680
it's

1535
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
as it's happening they're basically just

1536
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,759
trying to figure out what does olay mean

1537
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,920
blue want to bring in anything on an

1538
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,520
action blankets

1539
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,559
instrumentalism and then we can um

1540
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,880
after that look at what the inactive

1541
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,520
writers say

1542
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,599
i think it's been said like in the in

1543
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,640
the

1544
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,599
inactivist and instrumentalist

1545
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,119
blanket perspective i don't know that's

1546
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,079
always tends to be like the classic way

1547
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,599
that i think about it but let's let's

1548
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,760
see what the authors say

1549
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,839
all right

1550
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,160
let's see in the first half how they set

1551
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,200
up this question and then

1552
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
we'll end with a fork in the road that

1553
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,880
we can discuss

1554
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,040
all right so they start with

1555
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,960
similarly defining

1556
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,200
blanket we we could look at the word

1557
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,440
overlap in the future but it's a scale

1558
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,040
free tool don't know if scale free was

1559
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
said in the other situation

1560
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,920
it's introduced as a statistical tool

1561
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,359
that allows us to interpret

1562
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,200
and then again we see allow for

1563
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,880
interpreting

1564
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,319
so

1565
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,240
the language has already conveyed

1566
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,160
certain

1567
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,319
flexibilities

1568
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,280
if one is to take a charitable

1569
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,760
though narrow reading

1570
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,760
so this isn't the only way to read but

1571
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,640
just in terms of how

1572
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,119
below the surface an argument is framed

1573
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,400
as in

1574
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,480
as in addition to

1575
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,880
the direct rhetoric

1576
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,240
um

1577
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,400
immediately moving to the relationship

1578
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,839
with the physical boundary

1579
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,160
in the abductive case we saw

1580
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,599
highlighting of

1581
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,400
the reality of the closure of the action

1582
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,480
and influenced loop

1583
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,640
but there wasn't a justification of a

1584
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,079
physical boundary and so i do think it

1585
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,520
is interesting the earlier discussion

1586
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,040
with like how does the multi-agent or

1587
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,520
like agent-based model perspective

1588
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,200
as a scientific tool

1589
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,760
help us model

1590
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,040
blurry systems as like swarms that are a

1591
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,240
certain resolution or density away

1592
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,079
then

1593
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,000
going straight to

1594
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,319
the fristen variant

1595
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,640
of the markov blanket

1596
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,640
where there are already active and

1597
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,040
sensory states rather than introducing

1598
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,520
it first in the general case like that

1599
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,160
it's about statistical insulating sets

1600
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,240
that can then under

1601
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,240
perhaps some situations be partitioned

1602
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,000
to like an incoming

1603
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,079
representing sense and then an outgoing

1604
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,480
representing action aspect

1605
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,160
and so those are the blanket states

1606
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,880
sense and action s and a here and then b

1607
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,119
in their figure one is the box around s

1608
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,240
and a

1609
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,040
and then uh the eta and the mu they're

1610
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,440
like kind of like flips of each other i

1611
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,480
don't think that's the only reason why

1612
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,440
they're those letters and they don't

1613
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,119
have to be those letters none of them

1614
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,200
actually have to be those letters but

1615
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,079
this is the connectedness structure or

1616
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,359
sparsity

1617
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,480
of what

1618
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,599
both the authors are describing

1619
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,359
all right then here's the fork

1620
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,960
it is possible to understand active

1621
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,760
inference in two ways

1622
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,680
i think we each had a few ways just

1623
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,960
today

1624
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,040
um a realist view

1625
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,400
that the properties of the model should

1626
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,799
be expected to exist as an ontological

1627
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,480
property

1628
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,000
in dot dot ontological being like

1629
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,119
not

1630
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,960
in the use of using the active inference

1631
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,040
ontology

1632
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,440
importantly differently enough

1633
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,680
but rather describing

1634
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,119
the philosophical ontological or real

1635
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,960
basis that's why it's associated with

1636
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,440
realism

1637
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,079
then the second way is the non-realist

1638
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,680
view that the model is simply an

1639
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,200
instrumental tool

1640
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,640
so

1641
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,559
we're at the fork

1642
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,200
of these two

1643
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,119
directions

1644
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,480
what is the move dean

1645
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,880
my my sense of the movie is that

1646
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,280
so

1647
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,760
does that not make up a whole and i'm

1648
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,440
not saying that in the

1649
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,599
tautological sense i'm saying if we're

1650
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,119
actively inferring as opposed to looking

1651
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,680
at a topic that's titled active

1652
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,280
inference

1653
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,119
don't we want to

1654
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,240
incorporate the entirety the complexity

1655
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,280
or for the sake of

1656
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,480
for the sake of being able to

1657
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,280
to

1658
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,000
understand

1659
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,440
an action

1660
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,720
is is active inference kind of

1661
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,920
it is

1662
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,520
my question would be how is active

1663
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,079
inference actually being used in each of

1664
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,160
these papers

1665
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,720
is it is it is it

1666
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,480
is it founding

1667
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,440
the argument that we don't want to

1668
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,920
get completing completion around theory

1669
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,480
through other minds or is it sitting on

1670
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,960
top of that kind of the icing kind of

1671
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,760
the

1672
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,400
way it it can make sure that we don't go

1673
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,440
too

1674
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,680
far off the rails my argument is that

1675
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,720
it's both

1676
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,240
if we're actively inferring

1677
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,359
blue any thoughts

1678
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,039
i don't know how is active in french

1679
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,480
being used in each paper i just went to

1680
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,599
go like look like like what what is the

1681
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,839
the drive home message i mean maybe

1682
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,240
that's something that we can leave for

1683
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,760
the dot too

1684
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,039
um

1685
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,680
where's the graphical abstract

1686
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,119
right for all of these strings uh well

1687
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,039
it it is hard to fish stuff out of the

1688
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,880
abduction paper due to like the lack of

1689
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,520
figures um i had to like go find my own

1690
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,280
figures for for the pretty picture

1691
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,160
okay let's look one layer deeper at the

1692
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,960
um

1693
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,119
the three

1694
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,760
ways that they suggest that one can be a

1695
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,039
non-realist about markov blankets

1696
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,559
it'd be a whole other

1697
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,720
intersection map with where's

1698
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,160
non-realist anti-realist

1699
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,000
pro-instrumentalist just

1700
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,079
we could do political compasses all over

1701
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,200
the map

1702
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,520
um and

1703
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
there would be even second level

1704
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,200
questions about how things are defined

1705
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,839
in what periods of times and just it's

1706
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,039
all good

1707
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,359
and so we try to

1708
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,960
follow

1709
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,480
these again

1710
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,480
i i like dean the way that you've

1711
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,319
brought it back to like navigating in

1712
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,039
this continuous space between two

1713
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,640
ferns

1714
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,480
between two poles

1715
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,359
um

1716
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,039
at minimum

1717
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,240
and then

1718
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,599
that stays in a kind of dynamic

1719
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,240
navigational setting

1720
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,920
it's and then if you're the moth that's

1721
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,440
uh if you can't go too close to the

1722
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,160
lantern either lantern

1723
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,720
if you hit one then you die

1724
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,359
so your flight stops there

1725
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,598
so

1726
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,319
that i think

1727
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,559
puts a very

1728
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,640
meaningful uh interpretive layer

1729
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
because just like

1730
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,400
mentioned the figures help with

1731
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,920
interpretation

1732
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,119
and shorter lists help like there's

1733
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,520
three reasons why i'm against this here

1734
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,280
they are one two and three those are

1735
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,839
important structures

1736
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,760
yet also there's a reason that people

1737
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,920
don't communicate through outlines

1738
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,000
outside of certain situations

1739
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,039
okay

1740
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,200
so tangent but what are the three ways

1741
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,559
that they're suggesting one can be a

1742
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,119
non-realist about markov blankets

1743
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,079
one

1744
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,760
meaning less

1745
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,079
semantic tools

1746
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,280
this is going to be i think very

1747
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,400
interesting

1748
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,319
they do not hold semantic value

1749
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,920
interpretive

1750
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,599
value

1751
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,839
linguistic or otherwise

1752
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,760
other than that constructed by using

1753
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,839
them to understand or predict behavior

1754
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,400
in the situation where the scientist is

1755
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,200
studying the stop sign

1756
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,559
they could say yet the statistical edge

1757
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,319
for me at mine

1758
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,599
is

1759
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,359
being used instrumentally

1760
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,680
and there would be a valid stance

1761
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,520
but especially when we take this

1762
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,960
semiotic

1763
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,039
view which is very similar to semantic

1764
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,359
and they have similar seed but the

1765
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,119
semiosis

1766
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,880
with the stop sign and the actual

1767
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,400
stopping and the social and action of

1768
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,839
stopping and the development of the

1769
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,200
agent that led to them having that

1770
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,119
belief in that context

1771
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,200
that isn't just setting it up in terms

1772
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,000
of

1773
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,319
merely propositional logic

1774
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,720
which we hinted towards

1775
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,039
in the dot zero and

1776
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,280
many many of the pearson the commons.org

1777
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,839
articles lay it out much deeper but

1778
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,240
abduction is not

1779
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,839
um a static

1780
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:34,480
set of rules alone

1781
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,720
the generating selection cycle includes

1782
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,319
at the very least

1783
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,440
structured novelty arising

1784
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,440
from internal external and everything

1785
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,559
between

1786
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,440
and a continuous type attention

1787
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,799
distribution

1788
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,760
and strategy on attention and so on so

1789
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,839
it's a much richer setting

1790
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,920
than potentially

1791
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,640
semantic which can mean in certain

1792
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,039
settings symbolic which is to say the

1793
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,720
kind of symbolic logic carried out by

1794
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,039
like a turing machine which can still be

1795
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,799
extensive so even a generous

1796
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,200
interpretation is still very

1797
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,319
um

1798
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,520
plausible

1799
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,880
but there's something different about

1800
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,480
semiosis

1801
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,200
and the biosemiotic that was mentioned

1802
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,399
in the other paper

1803
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,760
that is not one and the same as the

1804
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,760
researchers modeling of

1805
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,760
and that was also

1806
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,119
explored

1807
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,520
well by yellow burnberg in the 2016

1808
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,440
paper the anticipating brain is not a

1809
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,559
scientist

1810
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,359
which contrasted a scientific analysis

1811
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,880
modality

1812
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,319
with

1813
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,880
the cognitive system as cognizer and

1814
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,400
distinguishing cognitive science in a

1815
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,319
way from that through ecological

1816
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,880
psychology dean

1817
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,240
yeah i was just going to

1818
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,799
tag on to that i i think it in order for

1819
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,039
this to happen i think in theory it's

1820
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,799
easy to say

1821
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,599
um

1822
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,520
we don't place a waiting on our priors

1823
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,359
i simply don't i remain objective

1824
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,359
throughout all of this but i don't think

1825
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,160
that most of us even when we take that

1826
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,280
real really strict scientific

1827
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,960
stance are aware of the priorities

1828
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,279
and the weights that we have

1829
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,600
even subconsciously applied

1830
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,799
so

1831
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:21,839
again

1832
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,600
i think i think

1833
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,920
you can say

1834
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,279
um

1835
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,198
there's no there's no value add to this

1836
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,520
i'm just i'm just i've removed myself

1837
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,000
from it and i'm just a passive observer

1838
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,960
of it

1839
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,640
but i'm not sure how how long we remain

1840
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,880
passive before we start applying

1841
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,799
weights and values to what it is that

1842
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,238
we're

1843
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,600
we're

1844
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,319
analyzing especially in a situation

1845
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,319
especially in situational analyses that

1846
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,880
are personal and the consequences fall

1847
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
back on us and now if you're simply

1848
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,719
watching something and there is no

1849
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,839
consequence upon you as the observer

1850
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,080
maybe that's easier to do but if you get

1851
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,198
to a place

1852
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,719
where the scientist is part of the

1853
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,399
experiment

1854
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,198
wow

1855
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,040
show me how that

1856
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,799
that switch gets turned off and you

1857
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,319
don't place a weighting on something

1858
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,640
very

1859
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,920
powerful and true and in many ways

1860
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,880
implicitly and explicitly

1861
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,279
the kind of messaging sometimes that i

1862
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,158
see in the information environment

1863
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,880
is about getting people to update their

1864
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,960
priors to believe that they're included

1865
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
in a larger problem

1866
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,198
which is an absolutely valid

1867
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:42,719
communication and perspective

1868
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,479
and the how

1869
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,920
of the path

1870
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,080
and the homeostasis and the multi-level

1871
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,359
system

1872
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,120
and the the critical path it has to

1873
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,719
follow

1874
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,040
including reflexivity and narrative and

1875
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,640
anticipation

1876
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,719
and this bottom-up top-down

1877
01:09:58,719 --> 01:09:59,920
aspect

1878
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,640
it's that is social inaction

1879
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,320
like people can argue that there's

1880
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,760
different social structures in different

1881
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,880
settings

1882
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,400
and it doesn't have to be a top bottom

1883
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,400
it doesn't have to be any specific

1884
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,880
metaphor or psycho psychoanalytic like

1885
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,920
lens

1886
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,120
basically

1887
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,159
um but the one shortcut

1888
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:19,199
to

1889
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,920
collapsing all of that complexity

1890
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,880
into

1891
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,320
a data point

1892
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,480
the the this one trick

1893
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,600
is to

1894
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,840
approach it like an experiment

1895
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,000
because that is what the experiment is

1896
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,880
in a way it is about finding a manifold

1897
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
where it's like this tube has this

1898
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,800
strand of dna and this set of things

1899
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,040
and then that allows the

1900
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,120
paint on the wall and all these other

1901
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,080
factors of the true context

1902
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,679
to be

1903
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,679
isolated from that's kind of like the

1904
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,080
partial information encapsulation

1905
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,480
or just any other type of system

1906
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,480
and then potentially we see like with

1907
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,760
quantum

1908
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,800
yes

1909
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,440
some persistent anomalies

1910
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,760
that suggested things were not always as

1911
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,400
they seemed

1912
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,480
however the real case study is not the

1913
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
quantum mechanics but it's the bayesian

1914
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,000
mechanics

1915
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,560
with the psychological study

1916
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,719
and the neuroimaging study and the

1917
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,719
behavioral study

1918
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:23,679
by

1919
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,480
all kinds of uh

1920
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,520
people

1921
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,719
in all social and action settings

1922
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,290
and

1923
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,480
[Music]

1924
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,159
that really does point towards some of

1925
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,560
the deeper implications of

1926
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,280
interactionism

1927
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,920
formal modeling of social and cognitive

1928
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,400
systems

1929
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,239
one could

1930
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,440
step out of that real life

1931
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,480
and enter into another

1932
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,880
and and situate themselves from like a

1933
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,960
third person perspective

1934
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,600
and look back onto

1935
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,719
this single path plane

1936
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,520
and see that as an experimenter

1937
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,199
and that is in many ways associated with

1938
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,839
metacognition

1939
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,600
however

1940
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,600
can that observer

1941
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,679
claim realism

1942
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,440
versus instrumentalism

1943
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,960
what where are people speaking from in

1944
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,520
terms of that view

1945
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,440
i don't know i'm just bringing up that

1946
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,840
sort of like are you

1947
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,719
where

1948
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,640
are you and that really relates to the

1949
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,320
self-concept of blue brought up and like

1950
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,640
the kind of situatedness with the self

1951
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,560
concept and then realist instrumentalist

1952
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,719
but let's move on through these points

1953
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,159
second reason why one could be a

1954
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,760
non-realist about markup blankets

1955
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,159
one could merely view them as valuable

1956
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,639
fictions

1957
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,520
yes okay that allow abstracting certain

1958
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,679
features of a phenomena

1959
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,840
but a valuable fiction

1960
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
one could ask are all of the generated

1961
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,199
interpretations

1962
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,000
fiction's valuable or not

1963
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,679
or so does

1964
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:02,880
saying it's a fiction and saying

1965
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,600
everything is a fiction

1966
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,640
is that um

1967
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,080
in what ways is that instrumental or in

1968
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,320
what ways is that realist

1969
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,080
making a real claim that that is the

1970
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,199
stuff which all things are

1971
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,120
though it's not of the stuff that

1972
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,440
potentially somebody was taught about

1973
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,080
atoms in a certain classroom

1974
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,239
so the persistent divergence can lead

1975
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,679
some to think that one of those is

1976
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,280
scientifically grounded and another is

1977
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,040
metaphysically grounded

1978
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,920
and or open to preference faith

1979
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,040
or other

1980
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,120
uh

1981
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,199
preferences and concerns entering that

1982
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,960
discussion

1983
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,040
and then um okay the third one is

1984
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,120
you could be a non-realist about markov

1985
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,280
blankets

1986
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,400
because

1987
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,719
just because it's the success of the use

1988
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,640
of the markup blanket

1989
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,400
justifies the acceptance of the

1990
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,640
epistemic value of the model

1991
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,520
without necessarily making ontological

1992
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
claims

1993
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,159
in other words

1994
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,000
just because the epicycle model is

1995
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,600
fitting well

1996
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
doesn't mean it's really an epicycle

1997
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,440
just because the circular orbit model is

1998
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,560
fitting well

1999
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,800
how well 99

2000
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,840
until somebody comes along and goes 99.9

2001
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,320
with a totally different model structure

2002
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,880
so it's kind of like saying

2003
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,840
how

2004
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,920
how sure could you be about a realist

2005
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,000
interpretation of the structure of the

2006
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,120
model

2007
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,000
when

2008
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,679
as part of one's commitment to the

2009
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,600
scientific process they might leave the

2010
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,199
door open

2011
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,920
to some future model with higher

2012
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,840
explanatory predictive power design and

2013
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
control et cetera dean

2014
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,840
yeah that's and i don't know where it is

2015
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,719
in the

2016
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,159
we we actually had it because i was

2017
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,640
looking at the slides from the 47-0 this

2018
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,560
morning and there's a there's a part

2019
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,239
that's highlighted in the other paper

2020
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,560
the talks where pierce says leave the

2021
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,360
door open that's what abduction is about

2022
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,080
it's simply the door is a jar you don't

2023
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,159
have the certainty but you have enough

2024
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,159
of you have enough

2025
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,520
information

2026
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,199
to make

2027
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,719
a hypothesis not an explanation to best

2028
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,159
or not a

2029
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,159
something rather the best explanation

2030
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,280
but you can now you now have something

2031
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,199
to move off of

2032
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:24,640
to to leverage off of and that's because

2033
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,520
the door was left open so again you can

2034
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,040
come at it from

2035
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,880
you can come at this conclusion that the

2036
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,480
third one the success of the markov

2037
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,640
blanket through the instrumentalist lens

2038
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,560
but there's people on the realist side

2039
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,800
that are saying the same thing the more

2040
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,600
open

2041
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,360
the more likely it is that you'll

2042
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,120
actually get to the

2043
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,960
the specifics sooner

2044
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,719
here's a fun

2045
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,840
ant example analogy to kind of bring it

2046
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,960
back to uh steven's earlier request um

2047
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,840
there's a faster is slower or slower is

2048
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,520
faster

2049
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,280
one can just imagine both ways but the

2050
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,159
empirical finding in ants is that during

2051
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,760
certain escape

2052
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,040
evacuation situations like leaving a

2053
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,960
room where alarm pheromone has been

2054
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,320
spread

2055
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,560
that when there's like a constriction in

2056
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,600
the exits so the morphology of the nest

2057
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,840
that they've constructed

2058
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
when there's a constriction

2059
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,640
that situation in car traffic jams and

2060
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,760
in people

2061
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,400
crowd situations can be very deadly

2062
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,080
and that it can be associated with like

2063
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,040
a crush

2064
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,760
situation or a liquid to solid

2065
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,000
like jammed in and then a fracture which

2066
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,760
can have all kinds of

2067
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,560
issues on the center of where it happens

2068
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,440
whereas in the ants they slow down their

2069
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,520
individual movements

2070
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,679
so it wasn't like some orderly queue

2071
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,440
everybody get in line and now we're

2072
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,520
gonna wait for number so and so to be

2073
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,400
called

2074
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,400
this was like

2075
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,520
their response in the situation

2076
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,840
to the biosemiotics

2077
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,520
and the niche construction of escape

2078
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,480
right

2079
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,679
was a slower is faster response

2080
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,080
such that yes their morphology as nest

2081
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,760
mates helps them like by having legs

2082
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,199
that are white out

2083
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,120
it they're physically

2084
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,199
insulating so it's not to say that that

2085
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,719
is the single

2086
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,560
thing for a human to semantically keep

2087
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,000
in mind in a physical escape setting

2088
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,760
but active inference

2089
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,320
lets us pull back to

2090
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,960
those different settings

2091
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,640
and look at the ants

2092
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,159
and their view from the inside the

2093
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,960
endosymbiosis like the pheromone

2094
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,880
perception the neurobiology of the nest

2095
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,320
mate and then there's the exosymbiosis

2096
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,560
with the scientist

2097
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,920
and then

2098
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,840
there are

2099
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,960
instruments in play

2100
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,040
dean

2101
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,560
so you're not thinking through ant minds

2102
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,320
that would be ttam instead of ttym

2103
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,679
however

2104
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,760
there is a sense

2105
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,040
that there is there is a hive mind at

2106
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,159
work even though you cannot necessarily

2107
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,600
share

2108
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,560
that

2109
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,239
hide mind there is no blending there is

2110
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,760
an autonomy

2111
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,920
and there is a sense that

2112
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,600
if if i am

2113
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,600
a believer in the top-down version which

2114
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,320
is enabled by an activism

2115
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,520
if i'm a believer in that i can also

2116
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,280
understand

2117
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,280
with without thinking through the mind

2118
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,719
of a realist

2119
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,640
what that realist

2120
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,280
perspective is

2121
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,080
so

2122
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,120
you're not

2123
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,000
we're we're not i would i would say

2124
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,199
that what thomas and inez wrote

2125
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,120
from the from a logical standpoint makes

2126
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,760
a a lot of sense

2127
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,000
but that doesn't disqualify

2128
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,480
me my my thinking

2129
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,199
and this other way of thinking

2130
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,520
from coexisting

2131
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,760
and and and having i don't think i don't

2132
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,719
know if the answer watching daniel or

2133
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,560
not maybe they are i mean maybe there's

2134
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
another narrative that daniel will share

2135
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,560
with us about when the

2136
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,320
ants became aware of him but i'll just

2137
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,719
tell you a quick story i

2138
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,000
feed magpies i feed orbits

2139
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,400
and what the corvids realized is it's me

2140
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,400
because they're very quick to

2141
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,320
recognize faces

2142
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,199
and what they do is they return the

2143
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,640
favor i get

2144
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,239
i get little

2145
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,880
little um

2146
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,760
i get bones from from from

2147
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,239
dead things that they've eaten i get the

2148
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,440
bones set on the same rock that i place

2149
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,560
the

2150
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,960
the dog food on because they love this

2151
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,360
this fish flavored dog food they

2152
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,520
actually return things and contribute

2153
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,320
back because they want me to continue

2154
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,719
that cycle so i don't know if ants do

2155
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,560
that but i do do know that other species

2156
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,400
whether they would describe it as

2157
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,080
knowing my mind

2158
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,639
certainly want to influence my behavior

2159
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,080
from a strategy standpoint

2160
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,159
awesome a lot of points there

2161
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,199
so that's

2162
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,040
in contrast with a

2163
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,679
framework like pan psychism or like

2164
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,159
the absence of psychism so just totally

2165
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,800
putting aside many of those questions

2166
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,960
you described like a pan-intentional

2167
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,080
stance

2168
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,280
ism

2169
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,440
a pan strategism

2170
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,360
that allows for complex holobionts blues

2171
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,800
microbiome

2172
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,679
as well as the human dog supply chain

2173
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:48,960
crow

2174
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,360
setting

2175
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,520
allowing for those to

2176
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,679
exist and be modeled by like decision

2177
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,360
making control theory game theory etc

2178
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,440
because of the pragmatism of the game

2179
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,600
it is like a doorway

2180
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,800
into considering all these situations

2181
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,760
as something to play some games to

2182
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,320
signal through some games to win at in

2183
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,239
this way or to have this outcome

2184
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,880
so that's pretty uh interesting

2185
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,960
then um

2186
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,560
there's thinking through

2187
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,880
other species that's very interesting

2188
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,800
idea and it'd be cool to design

2189
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,080
experiences like through games or art

2190
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,600
that could allow for different kinds of

2191
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,960
communication

2192
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,000
and then

2193
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,719
on the point in the abductive paper

2194
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,320
about the economy of science which we

2195
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,560
can return to that discussion of

2196
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,199
pearson's concept

2197
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,199
it's like thinking through reviewers

2198
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,239
minds

2199
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,120
and so just seeing also facets

2200
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,880
or thinking through my chest opponent's

2201
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,660
mind it's not a total emulation

2202
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,520
[Music]

2203
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,239
but no but being able to

2204
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:01,440
generate interfaces affordances policies

2205
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,520
there's so much

2206
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,480
in a partial information situation

2207
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,960
that the entity has to generate

2208
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,880
and the generation scope means that

2209
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,560
there has to be a strong selection

2210
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,239
mechanism too and those are the cycles

2211
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,920
of

2212
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,960
temporal

2213
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,199
abductive logic

2214
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,719
which breaks us

2215
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,400
out of

2216
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,280
the inductive deductive

2217
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,480
static conceptual

2218
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,320
dialectic

2219
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,400
and this brings pragmatism action

2220
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,360
ecological psychology and so on so it's

2221
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,239
really fascinating to see what

2222
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,679
is flowing

2223
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,080
within that space of

2224
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,800
formal models of perception cognition

2225
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,159
and action

2226
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,560
which are thousands of years old and it

2227
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,800
will be important to understand so many

2228
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
of these different threads

2229
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,440
because they're not all quantitative

2230
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,280
and uh the abductive paper and the

2231
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,960
social and active paper are

2232
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,960
demonstrating two of the most important

2233
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,600
areas where that's the case dean

2234
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,760
yeah just go on real quick on that

2235
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,600
so it wouldn't matter if i've decided

2236
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,360
that i wanted to do a situational

2237
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,239
analysis and base that on the very real

2238
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,719
gifting

2239
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,199
gifting exercise that's going on or at

2240
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,960
least i'm interpreting it as a gifting

2241
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,960
exercise that would be one approach that

2242
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,480
i could take the other approach i could

2243
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,480
take would be a very instrumentalist one

2244
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,040
in terms of token exchange

2245
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,960
either one of those things

2246
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,840
would work putting them together

2247
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,239
might might

2248
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,199
be

2249
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,679
even more additive i'm not sure i don't

2250
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,760
think it would be confusing i think it

2251
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,520
would just

2252
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,600
provide two lenses

2253
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,840
on the

2254
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,400
same

2255
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,840
on the same

2256
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,320
process

2257
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,320
looking at

2258
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,440
uh

2259
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,120
hippolyta and vanessa's figure two and

2260
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,320
three

2261
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,719
so here is

2262
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,280
a perspective on social

2263
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,880
construction

2264
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,239
that they're pulling from

2265
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:09,760
non-inactivist or non-active inference

2266
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,840
perspectives

2267
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,480
the difference with figure 3 is the

2268
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,400
social action in figure 2 under the

2269
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,159
active inference framework

2270
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,880
is the coupling

2271
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,400
and so

2272
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,080
there doesn't seem like there be even

2273
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,320
one kind of thing

2274
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,280
that would be captured by this gray box

2275
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,280
in the middle of figure 3.

2276
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,040
so

2277
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,760
play it safe

2278
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,080
take an instrumentalist perspective on

2279
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,120
this gray box

2280
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,040
it's

2281
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,040
one very important

2282
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,880
node and interpretation

2283
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,040
and then pass that you know through the

2284
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,159
tubes

2285
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:53,920
to the abductive reviewer

2286
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,239
who looks at it and says yes and the

2287
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,840
social actors are engaging in abductive

2288
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,520
logic

2289
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,520
my background in pierce

2290
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,159
suggests that abduction

2291
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,480
primacy of the generation selection and

2292
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,800
the time dynamics and the flow of action

2293
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,040
with the environment

2294
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,560
from pierce's work

2295
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,239
abduction

2296
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,679
can be interpreted in a realist

2297
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,080
framework

2298
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,280
so this can be held instrumentally with

2299
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,360
this

2300
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,080
view with this eye

2301
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,400
and one can then ask whether the

2302
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,480
abduction

2303
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,719
that you're modeling it doing abductive

2304
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,000
logic

2305
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,320
may even be able to hold an instrumental

2306
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,360
stance

2307
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,000
but is it instrumental for the social

2308
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,960
actor for the endo semiosis instead of

2309
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,280
from the axosemiosis blue

2310
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:51,600
so you kind of took the words right out

2311
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,199
of my mouth there good job um so like is

2312
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,560
this gray box this

2313
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,840
socio-cultural meanings and model based

2314
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,159
reasoning like can those

2315
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,920
be subsumed

2316
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,000
under

2317
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
exosemiosis

2318
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,760
are you asking if can it be a filter

2319
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,239
like is exosemiosis

2320
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,440
like

2321
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,560
the imputation of sociocultural meanings

2322
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,320
and model-based reasoning is that

2323
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,320
exosamiosis

2324
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,480
from the definitions that i've seen in

2325
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,480
the usages i've seen it exo means from

2326
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,040
the outside endo means insight in

2327
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,920
general in scientific words semiosis is

2328
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,480
the meaning construction process

2329
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,480
so

2330
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,440
exosymbiosis is a view from the outside

2331
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,000
for example looking at that stop sign

2332
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,719
situation unfolds looking at that ant

2333
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,960
pheromone situation unfold

2334
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,440
whereas the endosemiosis is the

2335
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,400
interpretive semiotic process

2336
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,159
by which something comes to have an

2337
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,719
internal

2338
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,480
meaning

2339
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,840
which then could be asked whether it's

2340
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,760
in a symbolic or a cognitive or an

2341
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,040
attention way and all these different

2342
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,400
aspects but

2343
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,520
i hope that that's an accurate

2344
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,000
distinction

2345
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,080
anyways are you actually you are you at

2346
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,159
i'm trying to make this

2347
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,080
simple for my little brain are you

2348
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,560
asking whether or not a person can take

2349
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,400
a third person perspective

2350
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,960
so i'm just like trying to understand

2351
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,400
like endosemiosis is very clear

2352
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,440
to me

2353
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,360
um

2354
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,400
but like this exo semiosis like when

2355
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,280
when i like look it up right right like

2356
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,239
so

2357
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,360
um

2358
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,520
endosemiosis is like the signal

2359
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,920
transmission into the interior that's

2360
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,719
like endosymbiosis like the

2361
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,400
um

2362
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,080
right like the the interpretation of

2363
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,360
signs into the inside but like this

2364
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,840
exosymbiosis is like between

2365
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,320
organisms like the sign interpretation

2366
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,040
and signal transmission between

2367
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,040
organisms of the same species or of

2368
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,360
different species like for example the

2369
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,520
ant pheromone like that's what i read as

2370
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,239
exosus so when you look at that figure

2371
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,920
three like

2372
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,719
is that not exosis

2373
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,560
i mean it looks like

2374
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,400
model representation and what was the

2375
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,840
other thing in there so i'm looking for

2376
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,000
the

2377
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,880
here's a fun view i think on the exo so

2378
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,719
yes i think we're in agreement here

2379
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,800
endosomosis is like the signaling within

2380
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,199
the organism or the view from the inside

2381
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:39,920
but

2382
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,840
that right there is the heart of also

2383
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,679
the boundary as a physical versus

2384
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,400
boundary as a functional so

2385
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,600
there's a whole

2386
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,520
complexity with biosemiotics which is

2387
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,120
usually i think why people talk about

2388
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,159
the bio

2389
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,080
semiotics and just recognize the

2390
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,880
complexity rather than take a stance too

2391
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,880
early on that partitioning but then this

2392
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,960
one is the exosomatic perspective

2393
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,199
constructing messages to alleged

2394
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,199
extraterrestrials

2395
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,520
so if we're looking who are the authors

2396
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,520
who are the authors of that paper

2397
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,560
they're listed here douglas a coach

2398
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,000
but yeah let's um

2399
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,400
well so so just this like sociocultural

2400
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,800
meaning imputation and and like in the

2401
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,199
meme paper that um daniel and i just put

2402
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,719
out and in

2403
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:29,760
um

2404
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,880
with rj and marijua um

2405
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,440
this semiotic representation is

2406
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,360
culturally

2407
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,639
like

2408
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,880
relative i mean like there's no a stop

2409
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,120
sign isn't going to be a stop sign to

2410
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,159
like someone in like the aboriginal

2411
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,280
like very like native primitive um

2412
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,440
like lifestyle right

2413
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,120
so

2414
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,800
this exo exosymbiotic is like a

2415
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,560
transmission between

2416
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,800
organisms of the same species but like

2417
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,600
also like the same culture i would say

2418
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,600
because like how do you you can't

2419
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,639
like

2420
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,159
and even i don't know if that's true in

2421
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,520
pheromones like if pheromones and

2422
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,040
different ant species

2423
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,960
mean different things like the same

2424
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,639
pheromone can have more than one meaning

2425
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,080
is that also true

2426
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,159
or the same like kind of molecular

2427
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,840
compound i mean i think we probably

2428
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,480
don't know enough

2429
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,120
i think i think i understand what you're

2430
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,719
asking now is there

2431
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,960
is there an assumed

2432
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,920
sense

2433
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,120
that there

2434
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,159
some some type of form of entanglement

2435
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,080
has to be present

2436
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,880
for any of that to make sense

2437
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,560
to make sense

2438
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,159
implies that something has existed

2439
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:48,159
that didn't maybe exist

2440
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,199
in the in the in the distant past it

2441
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,400
wouldn't exist in a different context

2442
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,480
so that that's why the socio-cultural

2443
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,320
meanings like like i think of that as

2444
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,840
like exo exosimiosis

2445
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,000
you

2446
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,159
i mean kind of goes without saying that

2447
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,960
there's just different

2448
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,840
closenesses along different axes

2449
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,760
like people who are speaking the same

2450
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,360
language but different

2451
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,360
vocabularies or

2452
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,639
you know

2453
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,480
the situation matters so much body

2454
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,760
language then

2455
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,960
the more

2456
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,360
uh distal or different the cognitive

2457
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,320
structure is

2458
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,760
relative to what

2459
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,239
it becomes harder to quote put yourself

2460
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,639
in their shoes

2461
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,560
and so on um

2462
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,800
and i feel like that's a big

2463
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,560
question with the multi-scale system

2464
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,280
phenomenas whether they're dissipative

2465
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,760
or persistent

2466
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,840
diverse intelligences

2467
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
understanding what the water we swim in

2468
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,960
is cognitively and linguistically

2469
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,199
because the water we swim in some of it

2470
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,440
is going to be the signal

2471
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,679
for something else

2472
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,320
it could be the influence signal

2473
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,440
like the b matrix in actinf influencing

2474
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,360
causal relationships in the world

2475
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,600
as part of the water you swim in

2476
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,840
it also could be like modifications

2477
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,320
through stigmargy niche modification

2478
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,560
like your physical influences which

2479
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,840
might be the water you swim in in the

2480
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,080
sense you don't notice them like many

2481
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,320
things that come you of and through us

2482
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,080
we don't direct awareness of

2483
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,199
so they're like the paint on the walls

2484
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,880
in that pcr

2485
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,440
experiment with amplifying the dna

2486
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,360
because it's the parts that whether we

2487
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,040
like it or not

2488
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,600
they get condensed down to a dot

2489
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,280
or a path

2490
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,440
and then that becomes our like sense

2491
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,560
making from local partial information

2492
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,440
as if a lot of the invisible part we

2493
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,600
could just disregard and we do

2494
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,360
cognitively like we talked about like

2495
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,600
the exhaust heat with chris fields and

2496
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,960
quantum like you have to burn

2497
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,760
information to pay attention

2498
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,040
and therefore and you have to pay

2499
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,639
attention to deal with a real complex

2500
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:05,760
niche

2501
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,520
so there's a lot of

2502
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,040
tensions

2503
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,400
in that

2504
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,679
path

2505
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:12,719
and

2506
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,360
uh especially with this dyad and i'm

2507
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,679
sure so much other related work but with

2508
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,040
this dyad

2509
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,440
and i think with the lens that

2510
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,360
dean you helped approach it to with

2511
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,719
um

2512
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,000
it is putting some of those

2513
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,679
threads into a different light

2514
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,800
and especially for those who

2515
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,040
in this semiotic way

2516
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,199
had some bayesian surprise some

2517
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,760
cognitive state updating

2518
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,199
from any number of different things

2519
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,120
that's like proof of concept

2520
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,199
social inaction

2521
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,600
but not in a

2522
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,120
corroded or in a performance art

2523
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,000
although who could say it's not

2524
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,960
performance art but still a way that

2525
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,280
brings the realism into the social

2526
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,880
through the formal and other doors

2527
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,080
uh dean and then blue

2528
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,920
i think i think i'd see both of these

2529
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,840
papers as pillars i see them as really

2530
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,639
stabilizing for different reasons

2531
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,400
and i would rather stand on both of my

2532
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,280
feet

2533
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,960
and have something stable under both of

2534
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,120
them and try to stand on one or have

2535
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,120
both feet standing on

2536
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,760
one cylinder because i find that i find

2537
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,400
that

2538
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,360
just based on my form more difficult

2539
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,400
but as

2540
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,480
as we tried to take up this new season

2541
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,560
of live streams and bringing two papers

2542
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,719
together that felt like a frontier

2543
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,840
moment

2544
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,719
and i think that one of the things that

2545
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:47,679
i

2546
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,360
hope we have conveyed is that

2547
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,840
looking at two things at once is by

2548
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,760
nature more complicated

2549
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,159
not necessarily complex the complexity

2550
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,960
exists in each of the papers but to to

2551
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,040
look at two things at once is more

2552
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,800
complicated and therefore is more

2553
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,040
fraught with the error

2554
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,600
of the trial and error

2555
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,159
relationship i'm not saying that we've

2556
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,360
made a bunch of mistakes but i think

2557
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,880
the first

2558
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,920
the first rule of generation is

2559
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,719
you won't get it right

2560
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,000
right away

2561
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,679
you will have to again have that

2562
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,119
temporal

2563
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,280
commitment in order to be able to get

2564
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,800
wherever the heck you think you're going

2565
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,440
and i i didn't really know where this

2566
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,000
was going to go other than

2567
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,400
i wonder what happens if we

2568
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,360
don't narrow our regime of attention

2569
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,400
didn't necessarily know we were widening

2570
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,080
it but i did know that at some point

2571
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,040
we might get the authors coming on and

2572
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,800
asking us

2573
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,280
asking us

2574
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,199
why pick these two i don't think it has

2575
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,040
to necessarily be these two papers it's

2576
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,000
just that

2577
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,239
both of these papers

2578
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:05,760
create and create a nice symphony

2579
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,560
right

2580
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,440
so

2581
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,960
it could be any set of papers

2582
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,119
it takes a chocolatier

2583
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,679
or a wine connoisseur to really make the

2584
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,080
pairing special

2585
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,920
yet there's other

2586
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,840
situations where any pairing can be

2587
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,639
potentially fruitful and insightful like

2588
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:25,920
sometimes i think about that in a

2589
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,520
community context like you're always

2590
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,119
going to share between zero and one

2591
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,320
context

2592
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,080
and wherever you are in that continuum

2593
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,920
the parts where you're sharing is

2594
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,960
awesome and the parts where you're

2595
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,360
different we can also respect as great

2596
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,679
or the overlap between two papers wow

2597
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,920
the word use was opposite

2598
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,520
or it was like contrary in some other

2599
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,719
way

2600
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:45,679
okay

2601
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,840
and then with the stance so then i

2602
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,119
thought of um

2603
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,400
the kind of like

2604
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,480
games where people have to stand on a

2605
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,480
single pole

2606
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,679
in a in a tropical beautiful location

2607
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,280
and try not to fall so i thought when

2608
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,360
you have both feet like you said on one

2609
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,119
position

2610
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,639
narrow

2611
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:05,760
then

2612
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,719
buffets of wind are assaults on your

2613
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,719
non-equilibrium steady state

2614
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,719
especially when it's like which one of

2615
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,480
these one person is going to be a

2616
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,520
professor

2617
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,280
just as an example

2618
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,600
um so why not

2619
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,040
resist

2620
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,000
and return to a fixed mode

2621
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,760
because that's like sort of the mode

2622
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,840
seeking that we heard about in some of

2623
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,119
dalton and maxwell's recent work

2624
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:34,880
the fixed mode is the center of gravity

2625
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,040
and then another way that you describe

2626
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,920
with like kind of having like a non-zero

2627
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,119
divergence and the space between is like

2628
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:43,920
in

2629
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,639
basketball the triple threat stance

2630
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,199
because you could dribble or pass or

2631
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,400
shoot

2632
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,040
by like going for the basket

2633
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,360
and uh yeah that's a different stance

2634
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,199
and it's also in a field of affordances

2635
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,800
so it's not just that they're in a

2636
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,639
different position like the feet here

2637
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:06,000
are not much wider than the feet here

2638
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,239
but this is the investigand mood

2639
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,880
as pierce would have uh

2640
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,480
maybe alluded to it

2641
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,960
that in a context

2642
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,600
with an action ecological psychology all

2643
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,920
of that in a context

2644
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,920
with an instrument

2645
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,080
and a game

2646
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,159
and something outside the game that

2647
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,400
supported the game

2648
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,320
all those levels

2649
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,400
are in the triple threat but the how did

2650
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,600
i get here

2651
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,719
why am i on the green one

2652
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,280
is a limited context

2653
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,080
and

2654
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,080
um

2655
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,719
yes it's still highly skilled nobody's

2656
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,719
questioning how

2657
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,480
how much energy is being poured into

2658
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:56,080
doing that thing that's that's hard work

2659
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,080
and there's a huge reward for doing it

2660
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:58,880
well

2661
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,920
and there's many and so i i

2662
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,320
totally agree and and didn't even intend

2663
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,920
to that people could have trained a lot

2664
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,520
for this one this could be someone who

2665
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,119
doesn't play basketball

2666
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,800
and so that's why it has to be a little

2667
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,800
dynamic and situational but

2668
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,480
just seeing them as kind of like extreme

2669
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,960
modes of paper interpretation in an

2670
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,880
extended paper

2671
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,960
interpretive metaphor

2672
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,480
one could see

2673
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,840
different modes of

2674
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,400
receiving

2675
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,360
semiosis from literature

2676
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,880
or discourse

2677
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,000
and then

2678
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,800
what is the role of participation

2679
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,040
and feedback and then that multi-agent

2680
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,080
setting that we mentioned

2681
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,400
hope that's not too random

2682
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:49,280
um in our last oh yeah blue go for it

2683
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,400
uh so one like pairing of papers that i

2684
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,440
would have liked to um have done is this

2685
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,239
abductive reasoning paper with um

2686
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,760
the chris fields quantum paper the one

2687
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,119
from the 40.

2688
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:04,800
like because i was just reminded of it

2689
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,560
so much as i was reading through the

2690
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,520
paper

2691
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,280
and just like learning about abductive

2692
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,880
reasoning and what does that look like

2693
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,880
and and how like we you know in

2694
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,960
abductive reasoning you don't have

2695
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,040
complete information it's like partially

2696
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,719
observable and so like you just make

2697
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,280
your best prediction from like a partial

2698
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,960
observation and it made me think of like

2699
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,320
the overlapping quantum reference frames

2700
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,600
where you don't like it like you can't

2701
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,159
get full overlap with someone else's

2702
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,239
quantum reference frame like like it's

2703
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:36,400
not like even with perfect learning

2704
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,040
there's still going to be some noise um

2705
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,960
or some overlap between the quantum

2706
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,480
reference or some

2707
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,400
incongruence between the

2708
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,560
um quantum reference frames some area

2709
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,800
that's not overlapping so so i don't

2710
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,880
know i just i those two things that

2711
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,560
that's like one pairing that i would

2712
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,000
have liked to

2713
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,159
see

2714
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,520
that's what's really interesting like

2715
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,119
as alluded to earlier the quantum

2716
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,280
broke the glass

2717
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
on the reflexivity question

2718
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,480
[Music]

2719
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,400
in philosophy of science i hope that's

2720
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,080
not too um

2721
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,639
overstated to say and it wasn't the only

2722
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,400
piece in the building or the weakening

2723
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,440
of the glass but the

2724
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,480
earlier mentioned persistent anomaly

2725
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,600
regarding experimental context

2726
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,239
expanded the scope of certain questions

2727
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,600
in science

2728
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,199
beyond

2729
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:36,000
discourse in certain cultural circles

2730
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,920
during the last like 500 years that

2731
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,880
stephen alluded to parts of

2732
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,679
so quantum is where this

2733
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:48,080
abductive temporal relationality

2734
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,239
it's there when you see it now it's not

2735
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,520
protoactive particle oh if the electron

2736
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,520
were just a pebble

2737
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,440
this wouldn't be happening

2738
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,560
or

2739
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,239
if the electron were a pebble that were

2740
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,000
bigger this wouldn't be happening but

2741
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,600
would it not be happening or would it

2742
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,520
not be happening because we could

2743
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,119
measure it better

2744
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,840
all of those questions about

2745
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,080
points and particles and waves

2746
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,880
under bayesian mechanics

2747
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:22,000
as a mechanics for cognitive particles

2748
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:25,040
the reflexivity now can flow in not just

2749
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,080
from

2750
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,560
electron scale

2751
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,480
but i feel like there are multiple

2752
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,400
contact services

2753
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,560
with reflexivity

2754
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,040
at the semiotic

2755
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,560
narrative

2756
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,000
ecological

2757
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,800
the real scales

2758
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,400
outside of the experiment

2759
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,480
and i think that is what partially

2760
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,560
speaks to

2761
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,880
the way that we entered this.one

2762
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,719
discussion too

2763
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,600
so um in our last

2764
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,840
five or ten minutes

2765
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,400
what would we like to

2766
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,600
have or note 4.2 just to the authors if

2767
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,199
they listen to this

2768
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:07,360
in the time between or not we're looking

2769
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,520
forward to talking to anybody who wants

2770
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,639
to whether it's for the dot 2 or any

2771
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,639
point in the future there's always a dot

2772
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,760
3 affordance so we hope to continue this

2773
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,560
discussion with those who have authored

2774
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,960
and those who have not yet authored

2775
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,719
because there's so much

2776
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,760
to build on on on this vector so both of

2777
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,280
you though feel free to as long as you

2778
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,239
would like

2779
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:31,920
just mention any points that you want to

2780
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,880
discuss for next week

2781
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,880
dean um had brought up earlier like

2782
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,159
where

2783
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:43,920
where is active inference is it is it

2784
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,960
the basis is it like resting on top of

2785
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,639
is there some kind of duality there i

2786
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,239
think like that's something that i would

2787
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:51,199
like to

2788
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,119
kind of look back at each paper and and

2789
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,119
figure out like where i where i want to

2790
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:56,719
put

2791
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,719
active inference in that pillar or on

2792
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,800
that pillar

2793
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,000
or is it the pillar i don't know

2794
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,840
yeah are we going to be able to go with

2795
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,360
our active inference colored highlighter

2796
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,560
and say okay these two words yep or you

2797
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,320
know this clause yep this paragraph

2798
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,840
with this paper

2799
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,480
or this interaction of the paper

2800
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,119
this tool developed by the paper

2801
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,760
where would one be looking to highlight

2802
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,119
how i saw the paper

2803
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,320
dean

2804
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,639
because i know stephen would completely

2805
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,480
agree with luke can i just get you to

2806
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,960
put behind where in brackets when

2807
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,040
his act of inference

2808
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,280
because again i think that matters so

2809
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,880
much if we're talking about abductive

2810
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,239
logic

2811
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,800
and retroduction the other thing is is

2812
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,000
that

2813
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,679
i i i

2814
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:55,040
i hope that that blue's

2815
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,000
thinking

2816
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,119
about

2817
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:58,080
well what

2818
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,320
what if we pulled other papers and

2819
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,639
entangled them what what fight back i

2820
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,560
hope that's an opening

2821
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,960
and i will say this

2822
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,119
it takes an incredible amount of

2823
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,960
preparation

2824
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,239
to pull two papers together and not

2825
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:16,719
do the proper respect for the amount of

2826
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:17,840
work that the

2827
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,159
authors the originators of that work

2828
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,520
have done

2829
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,760
so whatever the whatever the preparation

2830
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,159
is in terms of quantifying it for a

2831
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,000
single paper to do it

2832
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,280
justice

2833
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,440
it's many multiples of that to quote two

2834
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,280
papers but i think

2835
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,080
if we are going to be active infers

2836
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,159
not just subject matter experts on

2837
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,840
active inference

2838
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,320
that that exercise as difficult and as

2839
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,600
time consuming as it is

2840
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,159
it literally it literally changes the

2841
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:49,760
game because we talked about the game

2842
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,719
here quite a bit today which again i

2843
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,560
didn't think that was going to come up

2844
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,119
but thank goodness it did

2845
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,520
because it's not oppositional the game

2846
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,480
can be

2847
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,800
everybody gets in the canoe

2848
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,560
and works together to arrive at the

2849
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,639
hawaiian islands that can literally

2850
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:08,960
literally be the game

2851
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,239
right it doesn't have to be a

2852
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,679
competition

2853
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,159
it's not a race it's do we survive

2854
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:18,639
given the limited amount of information

2855
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,560
that we need to glean here

2856
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,639
as as as

2857
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,560
important to our our ability to continue

2858
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,719
on i think that's what being an active

2859
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,080
infer is

2860
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,159
that's where the shift from a subject

2861
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,920
matter expert to a prediction matter

2862
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,400
expert actually transitions

2863
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,280
so

2864
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,520
i want to thank people again

2865
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,000
for what feels like hanging yourself out

2866
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,040
there in a real risky way

2867
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,600
because it is risky that's what it is

2868
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,960
thanks

2869
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,119
again there's so much to say i hope that

2870
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:57,600
it's an honor and a privilege to

2871
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,320
be in epistemic spaces

2872
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,760
and have

2873
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,639
one's uh homeostatic variables

2874
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,320
secured so that opens up an amazing

2875
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,000
space and approach

2876
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,080
um the temporal aspect of abduction

2877
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,560
sounds so great to return to

2878
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,080
because i think another one of those

2879
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,960
points of contact communication

2880
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,199
is the dynamic what were the only

2881
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:26,000
formalisms in either paper in terms of

2882
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,360
like equations and mathematical symbols

2883
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,199
it was three representations of

2884
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,960
dynamical systems

2885
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,880
of hipolito and van ness

2886
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,440
to connect and ground

2887
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,760
a contact point from where they were

2888
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,600
taking a stance and a skilled

2889
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,800
performance

2890
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,840
into

2891
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,480
the mathematical symbolic

2892
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,800
scientific someone says this paper is a

2893
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,560
philosophy paper yes but it has

2894
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,320
equations so

2895
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,400
that is gonna come to be something

2896
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,360
different

2897
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,520
um and then

2898
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,040
you thought reading a paper would change

2899
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,000
the game

2900
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,159
but reading multiple papers changes the

2901
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:06,239
game and it is in a way true it uh is

2902
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,480
more

2903
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,360
reds to keep in mind

2904
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,280
because

2905
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,960
at least under some

2906
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,840
norms and preferences for paper

2907
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,400
discussions

2908
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,719
like personally i prefer

2909
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:22,400
and find myself at home when people

2910
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,560
don't extensively speak

2911
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,360
from what a person thought and take the

2912
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,080
endosomic perspective from them

2913
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,000
or from like a whole culture which seems

2914
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,600
implausible to me

2915
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,639
but

2916
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:39,119
situates the exosus of themself

2917
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:42,920
in relationship with a non-trivial

2918
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,719
endosymbiosis

2919
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,040
and where do those two

2920
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,920
threads meet in the blanket

2921
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,119
which is

2922
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,360
in potentially its most elegant coarse

2923
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,960
graining

2924
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,480
represented by the gray box here

2925
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,920
and why would we want to delimit

2926
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,840
or even grip

2927
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
maybe the grippers that we have at this

2928
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,800
point

2929
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,639
are like

2930
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,239
car pliers

2931
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:13,599
and this is something very different

2932
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,639
and or something active

2933
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:18,239
so

2934
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,159
at this or any point in time it seems

2935
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,920
absolutely valid

2936
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,679
to look at the structure of figure two

2937
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,040
and three

2938
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,560
and hold so many stances

2939
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,280
at once or in rapid

2940
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,119
navigation so

2941
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:36,080
wow what a fun discussion

2942
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,000
thanks steven for joining in blue and

2943
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,119
dean

2944
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,520
and we will look forward to some

2945
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,520
interesting times in the

2946
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,840
dot 2 and beyond so

2947
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,159
peace out

2948
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,400
you
