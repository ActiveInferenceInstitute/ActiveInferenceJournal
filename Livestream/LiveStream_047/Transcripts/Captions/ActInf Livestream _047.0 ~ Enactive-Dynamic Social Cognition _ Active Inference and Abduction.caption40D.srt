1
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,129
All right.

2
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,097
Hello and welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,768
This is ActInf livestream number 47.0.

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,004
It is August 3rd, 2022.

5
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,808
Welcome to the Active Inference
Institute.

6
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,145
We are a participatory online
lab and institute

7
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,115
that is communicating, learning
and practicing applied active inference.

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,618
You can find us
at some of the links on the slide.

9
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:57,524
This is a recorded and archived and
transcribed and published live stream.

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,294
So please provide us with feedback
so we can improve our work.

11
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,664
All backgrounds
and perspectives are welcome

12
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:09,736
and we'll be following video
etiquette for livestreams.

13
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:14,574
All active inference institute
activities are participatory, so

14
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,744
do let us know if you want to contribute
or get involved.

15
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,013
Head over to active inference storage.

16
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,283
And click the links to participate
directly and to learn more.

17
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,553
Well, we are about to

18
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,156
set off on a odd numbered

19
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,193
and unique adventure in 47.

20
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,263
We're going to be discussing
and juxtaposing

21
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:43,169
not one paper as per usual,
but have a multiple eyes open

22
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,072
approach towards two papers
in this situation.

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,342
We're going to be learning and discussing

24
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,913
in a juxtaposed fashion
two papers, "Active Inference and Abduction"

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,749
in 2021 by Ahti-Veikko

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,619
Pietarinen and Majid D. Beni.

27
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,890
Also, we'll be discussing "Enactive-Dynamic Social Cognition 

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,327
and Active Inference" by Inês 
Hipólito and Thomas van Es,

29
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,929
also from 2021.

30
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,533
All videos, dot zeros
and otherwise are introductions

31
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:19,472
to these ideas in additional context,
not a review or evaluation or final word.

32
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,778
And we are going to consistently,
we hope, use this coloration

33
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:31,351
of a light read for the abducted paper
and a light blue for the inactive,

34
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,687
leaving the space open
for new colors and combinations

35
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:39,125
to arise that demonstrate
some areas of synthesis.

36
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,096
And we're going to talk in this dark zero

37
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,100
with some big questions
and go over our aims,

38
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,270
as well as reading in between those aims,
which is a little bit different

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,738
than many live streams.

40
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,909
We're then going to provide overview
information on each paper

41
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,679
in terms of the aims,
the claims, the roadmap and the abstract.

42
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,918
Well, then move to a background
and context section that will include

43
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:10,023
a lot of information on an action
semiotics abducted of logic and so on.

44
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,194
Well, then move into a juxtaposition
of the two papers

45
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,131
and we're going to have a lot of time
to discuss with hopefully

46
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:23,303
multiple authors in the upcoming
discussions .1.2 and maybe beyond.

47
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,173
So today,
we wanted to bring a big picture context

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,610
and talk about some very interesting
threads,

49
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,048
provide a little bit of background
that helps one enter into this space

50
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,418
and then provide initial
juxtaposing action and run

51
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,522
through these papers that again,
we'll just get somebody excited

52
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,226
to read the papers, dove in more deeply
and bring their own perspective

53
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,295
to bear on these
very interesting topics. So

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,166
we'll move to the introductions.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:53,933
I'm Daniel.

56
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm a researcher in California
and I'll talk

57
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,673
more about what's exciting in the coming
slides.

58
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,675
All positive.

59
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,177
Good morning.

60
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,714
My name is Dean in Calgary
and I guess I was

61
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,850
maybe the the work mind that tried

62
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,520
to put this idea together
and maybe change a little bit.

63
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,391
The way that we look at active inference
by trying to pull

64
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,127
two different papers of seeming seemingly

65
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,264
different folk focuses

66
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,833
and then both of those also

67
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,902
incorporating the use of active inference

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,239
as a methodology
to situationally analyze.

69
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,541
And so what are the implications
for that?

70
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,611
So I find that really kind of exciting

71
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,547
and I'll pass and received.

72
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,717
So thank you.

73
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,385
Yes, Stephen.

74
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,687
Here I am in Toronto, Canada,

75
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:52,392
and I'm really interested
in about both of these papers

76
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,362
because they both speak a lot to kind

77
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,432
of participatory approaches in general.

78
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,568
And the idea of how people
are engaging in the world.

79
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,972
So the questions around

80
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,175
in action is,

81
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:13,112
is really relevant
as is the action piece. So

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,983
while they're both quite different
papers,

83
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,652
they're both speaking

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,155
to me quite strongly.

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,423
So that's really interesting.

86
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,993
So I'm looking forward
to being able to sort of explore that.

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,764
I'm, I'm work with participatory
theater, community

88
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,468
psychology,
community development and multi scale

89
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,273
development processes,
and I'm really excited to

90
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,210
just see how this scientific

91
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,612
take can be a more

92
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,350
what might be called a practice
based participate

93
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,153
truly question that I've been looking at,
so I'll pass it back to Daniel.

94
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,688
Excellent.

95
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,456
Thank you both.

96
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,459
And Dean, thanks again for the many month

97
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,795
journey, the many email and month

98
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,100
and message journey that we've walked,
because I do hope this will

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,037
unfold and include
in a way that is taking live streams

100
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,908
and the kind of materials that we're working through beyond where we have gone.

101
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,613
And in spirit of that, I will

102
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,083
pass the dean to introduce
some of the big questions here.

103
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,820
Well, if you've got a pull to papers

104
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,488
that don't seem

105
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,024
to have a heck of a lot in common
in terms of their subject matter,

106
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,395
you're going to have to come at it
from a little bit of a different angle

107
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,330
in terms of not just ferreting out

108
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,601
what's within a paper,
but how those papers might be compared.

109
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,371
So we pulled together
some some questions around the idea

110
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,842
of what role
as a situational analysis, this

111
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,879
either tool or reality method,

112
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,250
active inference
might play in playing things

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,320
that seem to be a long ways
away and apart and entangle them.

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,291
And so questions were basically,
can active interest be both

115
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,895
something that pulls or contains
or bounds something

116
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,165
and also be
the thing bounded or being gripped?

117
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,270
What is active evidence or what is active
interest is both.

118
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,772
The thing being contained,

119
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,442
say a partition or

120
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,611
line in a table and the cell

121
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,615
so that the actual gap
that we can actually put more information

122
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,985
into what that look like,
what it would look like, both

123
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,088
as a constraint
and a separator simultaneously.

124
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,491
And I think it's that mutuality piece

125
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:42,094
that we're going to try to tease out
in the next few live streams

126
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,932
and what is similar or different
in getting a grip on models

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,837
and a different process,
which is modeling.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,438
Thank you, Steven.

129
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,641
Stephen,
do you want to add anything here?

130
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,544
No, I think that that covers a lot of it.

131
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,081
The only thing that that X that's
there is so denoting

132
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,451
no can active inference models modeling

133
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,753
frameworks.

134
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,357
So this this
this contextualization of the term.

135
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,260
So it comes into play, but we're going to
talk about that a bit later.

136
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,729
So yeah. Thanks. Awesome.

137
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,833
And this is one of potentially

138
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,569
the first our aims slides

139
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,174
because it is hopefully going
to help to come back to this level.

140
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,776
The mean

141
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,747
here represents this live stream
bringing together

142
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,718
the two papers in a way
where we've had one hand clapping.

143
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,255
Now we're going to bring that together
into two.

144
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,489
You can hear the sound

145
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,058
coming out of the live stream already,
especially if you're listening.

146
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,097
Dean, what would you describe
about our aims or how would you

147
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,734
summarize
one other note I'll add about alternate

148
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,937
aims is we want it to be comprehensive,
but also to have videos

149
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,940
that are listenable
and have reasonable temporal duration.

150
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,877
So there will be many slides
that will have a lot of text copied

151
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,048
out of the paper and will merely note
pause the video if you'd like to read.

152
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,351
But we're just going to move on
from many of the text slides.

153
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,288
We just really wanted to make sure
that all the text was there and visible,

154
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,623
but we're not going to read everything.

155
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:23,563
So please, Dean, summarize what of these
aims you'd like to talk about.

156
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,032
I'm just going to talk about this sort of

157
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,001
the root of each one of these bullets,
which is take a closer

158
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,071
look at the realism instrument
instrumentalist of debate.

159
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,908
I don't have to go into what that is
if you're going to participate in it.

160
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,880
You know, we're describing reinforce
a two eyes open approach where one eye

161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,451
takes in the pair of active inference
papers, the inactive denote

162
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,655
dynamic social condition and abduction,
while the other man,

163
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,260
the other eye manifests active instances
that as an integrator of both

164
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,331
because we think that
it actually can do that without blending.

165
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,866
You can actually cause a reaver, a braid,

166
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,537
and then the third bullet
is make explicit the absolute necessity

167
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,040
if we're going to do those
first two things of understanding

168
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,444
the temporal depth of models
that would actually

169
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,915
incorporate two papers of seeming distant

170
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,351
topics

171
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,554
as we make active inference
into two different subjects.

172
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,890
And then just while we did,
is pulled out different

173
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,827
things
that the authors noted about your picks.

174
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:29,862
Thank you.

175
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,666
And Steven, if you could carry forth
with reading in between

176
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,935
those aims or adding anything
you'd like from this slide.

177
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,503
Yeah.

178
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,872
Thanks, Daniel. So,

179
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,742
you know, one set of authors says,
you know, is really looking

180
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:48,481
at instrumental ism and, you know, it's
a valid scientific perspective.

181
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,886
But no, there is then describes,
you know, this question

182
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,188
about the road towards

183
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,892
realism and Mormonism.

184
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:05,598
So, you know,
where the idea is that in one paper,

185
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,902
the instrumental ism
is is the way to sort of punch

186
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:15,041
or to to to sort of hold ourselves
in this scientific work.

187
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,545
Well, that can be challenged.

188
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,481
And we would
we would see ways that we might need to

189
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,018
to loosen that when we get into
participatory approaches.

190
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,289
So something in between
which loosens that scientific space

191
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,858
and the practice space.
So the same with the second point

192
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,462
where okay is, is

193
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,099
instrumental ism,
you know, the way forward.

194
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:44,770
So what, what constitutes the pages
when living in in these

195
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,806
what constitutes living beings

196
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,643
and how do we resolve which way forward?

197
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,412
So if there's if
there are contradictions,

198
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,185
should we reconcile them
if we're in a team trying to use this,

199
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,620
should we just live with them
and just move forward

200
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,657
or where
should we actually highlight them?

201
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,461
So this is in a way
trying to think in an outside of

202
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,765
maybe this sort of laser
focus on the scientific

203
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,669
philosophical point and saying, okay,
when we try to bring these into a team

204
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,873
context,
should we would we lose in some of that?

205
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,877
So and so just it just mentions here
to give an application.

206
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,714
Should we
then also think about active inference

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,017
being prefaced or suffix,
you know, adaptive active inference,

208
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,422
effective active inference or active
inference modeling, you know, is

209
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,092
how important is that clarification to.

210
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,497
So then also think about how
the instrument sense of realism piece

211
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,800
might be utilized in these other ways.

212
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,102
Do we need to position,

213
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,573
you know, fully in one, fully on another?

214
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,910
And if we're in between, you know, can

215
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,013
there be greater or lesser access
to knowing based on the contexts

216
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:05,184
so often in participatory
work of different types of practices?

217
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,419
You know, the context is key.

218
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,691
And then this sort of speaks a little bit
to my own idea of the co-creative work.

219
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,893
And I know that

220
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,798
Daniel is very much with teams
and teams very much with transformation.

221
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,567
You know, often there
there's a co-creation pieces.

222
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,204
There's a bit where you want to support
the butterfly without crushing it.

223
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,206
There's something quite delicate there.

224
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,542
So how can we at times

225
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,712
doing this into spaces
where it's a co-creative space,

226
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,782
where there's modeling happening
in a more subtle, contextual way?

227
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,618
And while we have these

228
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,923
scientific definitions
and strategic designs and hard analysis

229
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,159
and they're useful,
we don't want them to crush

230
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,261
what's happening.

231
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,332
And there's a couple of pictures there
that sort of speak to that and I'll pass

232
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:53,933
you over to Dean.

233
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,870
Maybe you can speak to the sampling,
the waters in between

234
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,772
and the mind, the gap.

235
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,776
Well, I think I think

236
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,311
that was beautiful exploration.

237
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,715
And I think when if
and when the authors are able to come on,

238
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,852
that will be something that will now
be able to put some color to.

239
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,423
I think maybe I think we put some anchors
in the ground, but we haven't said

240
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:22,294
how much how much flow can go between
those different nodes.

241
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,831
And that's what I think we wanted
to establish right here, is the between

242
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,368
this line two times, like it says,
mind the gap.

243
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,737
That's
the only thing that can carry a subway.

244
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:32,838
All right.

245
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,341
Because you're
not paying attention to the gap.

246
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,409
And I think the sampling of the waters

247
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,846
in between does the same thing, except
that it provides a little different

248
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,417
subtle difference in terms
of the fluidity of those kinds of gaps.

249
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:51,023
So I think it would be really interesting
if we if we use that as our portal into

250
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,327
how we might bring things together
and make them dance

251
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,164
when they otherwise would be sitting
on chairs on opposite sides of the room.

252
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,302
That might be an interesting conversation
to start in.

253
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,103
The DOT wanted to.

254
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,172
Thank you both.

255
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,645
And the only comment I'll add here
is this discussion

256
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,115
we've been having on the adjectives
that preface

257
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,852
the adaptive affective, etc.,
active inference.

258
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,856
And then also, Steven,
the focus you've brought to the suffix

259
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:29,428
that x in brackets active inference model
as one instance or case or realization

260
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,932
active inference framework active
inference process theory what what

261
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,869
follows and this really reminds me
of left branching and right

262
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:42,474
branching clauses in grammar and syntax
and that there's a base clause.

263
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:48,681
What is our base clause and then what
branches before, during and after.

264
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,651
I think there's a very rich space
and I really like these embodied

265
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,621
and flux based metaphors

266
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,491
that help us understand

267
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,962
so much so into the paper overviews.

268
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,567
This will just be some metadata
and descriptions on the papers

269
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,171
before we pull back
to the background in context

270
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,042
and then move forward into the papers
running through their main points.

271
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,812
So we're not going to read the abstracts.

272
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,781
They're both,
of course, available for these papers.

273
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,385
Here is the abstract for active inference

274
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:31,023
and abduction.

275
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:35,294
Here's the abstract for inactive dynamic
social cognition and active

276
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:40,199
inference.

277
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,302
Here are the keywords
for both of these papers.

278
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,305
The inactive paper has the keywords

279
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,974
social cognition, niche construction,

280
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,779
active inference, theory of mind
in activism and Dynamical Systems Theory.

281
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,414
The Abduction

282
00:16:55,414 --> 00:17:00,519
Paper has the keywords abduction,
active inference, free energy, principle,

283
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,889
first and blanket triadic relations

284
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,992
and pairs.

285
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,462
Let's go to the aims of and the claims

286
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,931
of the abduction paper.

287
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,402
So, Dean, would you like to cover

288
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,571
any of the aims of the abduction paper?

289
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,741
I What I would like to do
is just sort of foretell what

290
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,012
both of both papers want to aim at
and that is you'll see

291
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,516
a keyword and the second bullet
of this one, which is alliance.

292
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,917
And then there are words

293
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,220
that you're going to see in the other
paper where they're again saying,

294
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,756
we want things to come together,

295
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,161
but we want to be careful
in how we describe that coming together.

296
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,465
We don't want it to be perceived
metaphorically as a blending,

297
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,501
as an undoing of two,

298
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,372
two or more things
that we believe have an associative

299
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,774
relationship.

300
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:59,445
And so I think when you're going through
the aims of the two papers, if you

301
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,680
if you kind of step back a little bit,

302
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,316
you'll see that
the authors of both papers are

303
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,419
doing a hard

304
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:12,391
explanation on what relationship
they want us to pay attention to.

305
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,461
And so that's something
that they both paper share.

306
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,463
It's the heavy emphasis on relationship.

307
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,365
Great point.

308
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,937
And they both are very richly
and powerfully written.

309
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,873
And here we see Alliance and Allegiance.

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,277
And certainly there's going to be
a lot of discussion in both the papers

311
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,581
about integrating disparate or partially

312
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,617
related ontologies and vocabulary sets

313
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,687
and different thinkers, different
threads of intellectual development.

314
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,491
These quotes from the paper can be read
and of course

315
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,493
are expanded upon in the paper.

316
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,396
But as Dean said,
this paper's focus is on the intellectual

317
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,967
alliance between active inference
and free energy principle.

318
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,537
FP And primarily the work of C.S.

319
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,440
Peirce in terms of semiotics,

320
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,943
pragmatics, Marxism, objective logic.

321
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,345
That is the aim.

322
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,082
Synthesis is bringing those two together
in a way that's synergistic and

323
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,817
is providing meaning. Stephen

324
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,787
Yeah, and just
following on from what you're saying,

325
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,791
the both these papers and particularly
the objective one is

326
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,762
it gives a way to look at areas
that are really hard

327
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,632
to simulate for computers.

328
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:32,204
And the way that abduction happens over

329
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,275
particularly with humans,
is very sophisticated.

330
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,612
And I think it's really helpful to
then see semiotics, which is actually

331
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:46,084
used a lot in its scenography
and set design pragmatism.

332
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,021
So go into this with it
with a with a really

333
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,492
a theory that transcends science.

334
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,029
Often
it is often used in other fields like

335
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:02,701
the natural sciences as some use for it,
but it's often used in the humanities.

336
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,538
So I think this is
speaking to that piece about

337
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:12,811
what is it that is revealed, that kind
of secret sauce, that kind of hidden soul

338
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:17,115
which is normally missing in action,
is also something that's like that

339
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,017
awesome.

340
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,788
Claims
of the paper or throughout the paper.

341
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,591
But just to highlight
some of the key claims,

342
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,829
they're claiming that that aim that
they set out to make between the work

343
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,866
of active inference and the abduction
and semiotic perspective appears.

344
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,436
They're claiming that that is feasible

345
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,138
and that they are providing
an initial sketch for it

346
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,975
in this theoretical theoretical

347
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,677
integration of the new in the old,

348
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,581
something red, something blue,
something new, something old.

349
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,518
And the two frameworks,
the new and the old respectively,

350
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,590
are the modern instantiation
of neuroscience and cognitive science,

351
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,995
represented by a free energy principle
and on the old,

352
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,799
a historically accurate and precise
interpretation of objective inference,

353
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,003
including the importance
of the economy, of research,

354
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,871
all things
that we're going to come back to.

355
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,906
Just wanted to clarify the claims there.

356
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:15,907
Can I just add one.

357
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:16,508
Place.

358
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,511
For a quick
so theoretical integration there?

359
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,348
I mean, from what if you can think back
to when we were talking about our aims,

360
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,852
now the question is with
this is what the authors are saying.

361
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,022
What we're wondering is,
does that make active inference

362
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,960
both the integration product
and the integrator the process?

363
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,762
And again, I want to

364
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,065
I want to kind of tease back
that one step, because I think that's

365
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,899
going to happen again.

366
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,001
When we look at the other paper,

367
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,772
they'll use different nomenclature,
but they're going to say the same thing.

368
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,342
And again, it's it's
hard to see the commonality

369
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,711
is unless you and I,
you don't have to make them up.

370
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:59,017
You just have to notice them in
in the two different types of forests.

371
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,186
And a point on that.

372
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,087
They're

373
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,424
both, in a way, using active inference
as an integrator

374
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,192
as well as as a differentiator.

375
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,262
We're making an integrated model
of internal

376
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,832
and external and blanket states
by differentiating them.

377
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:18,770
And then, of course, integration
and differentiation also have a joint

378
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,075
usage in mathematics with the integral
and the derivative notation.

379
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,344
So there's going to be a lot of things
coming together,

380
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,613
steaming your hands to up. Yes, please.

381
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,682
Yeah. Just one thing as well.

382
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,850
I think this is really helpful

383
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,953
to talk about neuroscience
in this computational neuroscience

384
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,323
and to highlight that
because I think something that

385
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,261
is the reality in the world
out there, the culture out there where

386
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,399
where these ideas are circulating
is that neuroscience

387
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:52,037
is turned on its head,
basically by active influence.

388
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,107
Neuroscience as a field, as people

389
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,910
understand it, is some sort of

390
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,780
deductive

391
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,016
process of stuff coming in
and then being evaluated and

392
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,621
concretized,
as opposed to this predictive journey.

393
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,157
So I think it's really, really useful

394
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,493
because this is
this is something that we all face.

395
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:19,264
And I think I also have noticed
when I've spoken to some neuroscientists,

396
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,701
they've actually had like
an existential crisis and shifted

397
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,105
partly often
by coming up with an active claims

398
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,908
and seeing really active
claims are there.

399
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,212
How can their work with neuroscience
be so held together?

400
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,915
So there's this, there's this.

401
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,451
There's a piece here
that relates to the general.

402
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:43,321
And that general piece is more important

403
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:49,795
when we start to bring active influence
out from the specialist areas

404
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,498
where it's kind of enclaves
and it's rules of the game are known, and

405
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,566
you're into the areas

406
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,670
where people say, neuroscience, well,
I know what that means and off you go.

407
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,372
So thanks. Great. Thank you.

408
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,342
The paper has relatively few sections.

409
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,545
It has an introduction.

410
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,214
It then presents a pairing

411
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,150
of active inference
in the light of abduction.

412
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,953
Abduction
in the light of active inference.

413
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:19,124
Slightly oblique reference
to nothing in biology makes sense

414
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,427
except in the light of evolution,
or except in the light of something.

415
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,231
And these are two lights
back to that island.

416
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,834
What is the space between?

417
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,870
And then there's a discussion

418
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,706
on the economy of research
and it's free energy naturalization

419
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,877
and the conclusion
and the pierce rabbit holes run deep.

420
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,582
We're going to go into a few soon
and onto the inactive paper.

421
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,619
So here we're going to be describing
the AIMS, claims and roadmap

422
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,890
of the inactive, dynamic social cognition
and active inference paper.

423
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,460
The paper presents a two fold

424
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,896
aim to dissect new accounts

425
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,233
that blend in activism
with inferential accounts

426
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,937
and explain why doing so involves
contradiction is the first aim.

427
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,740
And the second aim is to offer

428
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,444
the only reasonable account linking
in activism and inferential accounts,

429
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,780
especially on this case
of social cognition.

430
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,817
So, yes, please.

431
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,454
Yes, I was hoping could you
now turn the word linking purple

432
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,658
for us? Yes.

433
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,228
Thank you. Yes.

434
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,833
If now we have different ways
of describing between that Stephen

435
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,571
did a lovely job of emphasizing
before we actually started looking at the

436
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,607
the papers themselves.

437
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,543
Yeah. It's a between.

438
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,211
Yeah it's awesome.

439
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,949
And it is actually through your request
and the slides platform,

440
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,786
it becomes
inactive, dynamic social stigma, logic.

441
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,291
And so that's a proof
of concept for what.

442
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,160
But this is the aims of this paper.

443
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,763
They also have many claims

444
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,365
articulated throughout the discussion

445
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,336
and they actually use some very clear

446
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,408
notation to describe the specific claims
from other work and from their own work,

447
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,011
and about which claims and hypotheses
have which logical relationship

448
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,714
they're going to make.

449
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,851
Claims about the nature of cognition
and its embodied basis.

450
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,088
They're going to be discussing
some of the claims

451
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,626
related to the human social cognitive
niche and talking about

452
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,430
the importance of relationship
inculturation niche construction.

453
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,734
And then they're going to be talking
about theory of mind time

454
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:49,140
and about the compatibility
or contradictions associated with linking

455
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:53,511
inactive claims with theory of mind

456
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,915
or inferential accounts.

457
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,085
The paper's roadmap lays out

458
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,587
many of these aims and claims
quite clearly.

459
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,091
They begin with an introduction
and introduce

460
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,795
a recent, though influential work
in the active inference field,

461
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,598
which is the thinking through other minds
framework team.

462
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,968
And they, as they say,
dissect this accounts

463
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,372
to try to tease apart
the way that in their view,

464
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,042
the inactive and the inferential counts
were brought together.

465
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,212
They also have a figure
describing a mark up blanket,

466
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,548
which is going to be a concept
that place Kealy in both of the papers,

467
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,153
section two Something's got to give,
rejecting inactive inference

468
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,191
through other minds,
they're going to utilize two assumptions,

469
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,828
namely that social cognition
reduces to mental representation,

470
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,165
and two, that social cognition
is hardwired from birth.

471
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,869
And they're going to disagree
with both of these assumptions.

472
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,806
And in their opposition
to these assumptions supported by sub

473
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,176
claims and evidence
that is going to lead them to their

474
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,247
broader conclusions, they're going to
use dynamical systems theory

475
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,684
and talk about how DST

476
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:10,789
can be linked with in activism in terms
of its compatibility and what these two

477
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,892
frameworks offer each other
within an instrumentalist reading.

478
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,996
And then they're going to discuss
active inference specifically

479
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,533
in the context of dynamical systems
theory on one hand,

480
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:26,071
and in active cognition, social cognition
on the other hand.

481
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,907
That's the inactive, dynamic hyphenation

482
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,645
they'll describe with a few figures
about similarities and differences

483
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,346
between social and action

484
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,383
generally as conceptualized
outside of active inference.

485
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,519
And then they're going to introduce
visually how active inference

486
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,388
enriches that picture.

487
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,491
And then they have a very interesting
table distinguishing

488
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,595
between are among phenomena observed
in the natural world and observe behavior

489
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,963
in the natural world.

490
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,967
Okay, awesome to run through the papers
that way.

491
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,572
Now let us move to the background
and context section.

492
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,141
So in this section of the zero,

493
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,011
we're going to use some quotes
from the paper for sure,

494
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,148
but we're also going to pull a step back
and demonstrate

495
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,017
just the tip of the iceberg
of the scholarship

496
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,121
and the research that we carried out
leading up to this point,

497
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,492
hopefully
to excite the listener or reader

498
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:25,130
and to provide some context into these
very deep threads

499
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,399
that are going to be approached
and approximated in the papers.

500
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,670
I'll provide a first note here or Dean,
please go for it.

501
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,072
It's just a guess.

502
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:39,778
I think it's a spectacular moment
to say, okay, so background and context.

503
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,916
So we're talking maybe the temporal
and the physical setting.

504
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,520
So that's now something
that we can situationally analyze.

505
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,121
And again,

506
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,092
just matter whether you use active
inference or whether you use a cast model

507
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,262
or whether you use
professional initiatives programing.

508
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,765
Bottom line is
everybody is trying to figure out

509
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,470
what the situation is through an analysis
method.

510
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:10,441
And I would imagine
that every one of those methods

511
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,012
has a greater or lesser viability D

512
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,716
depending upon what the situation,
both temporally and physically is.

513
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,588
So I think that's
the critical thing is we're not saying

514
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,191
that each of these papers are good
or bad.

515
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,895
We're saying that each of these papers
has a focus on a different

516
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,200
background
context combination, minimum of two.

517
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,070
So now if we pull the two things
together, we can't say

518
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,808
that that it's going to be the same thing
that we're going to come up with, that

519
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:48,112
our aims as people who have now looked
at the two papers side by each,

520
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,883
that's
going to create a whole new entity.

521
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:52,317
Thank you.

522
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,652
To lead

523
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,656
off this background
and contextualizing section, I wanted to

524
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,194
invoke one of my favorite artists
and poets, William Blake.

525
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,565
And Blake
wrote Controversies are positives.

526
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,203
A negation is not a contrary
negations are not contrary.

527
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,606
Contreras Mutually exist,

528
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:20,245
but negations exist not exceptions
and objections and unbelief exist not,

529
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,147
nor shall
they ever be organized forever and ever

530
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,150
and quote

531
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,621
Contreras in this Blake

532
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,323
in fourfold logical framework,

533
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,928
in fact, are part of a dialectic
and they exist

534
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:41,199
as a function of each other,
like convex and concave, or like gravity

535
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,502
and radiation, as Buckminster
Fuller might take it towards.

536
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,207
And so negations
in this poetical framework

537
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,076
are those which exist not,

538
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,947
whereas A and B can be on the contrary,

539
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,950
whereas A and not A
have a different logical relationship.

540
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,953
And this kind of fourfold
logical approach

541
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:06,391
to recognizing the state space
and the truth claims

542
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:11,162
that multiple all juxtaposed
assertions can have with among each other

543
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,066
is also for staged
in a lot of world knowledge traditions.

544
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,569
For example, the Carter Scotty.

545
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:23,741
And this is a logical tool and method
that's been applied for a very long time

546
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,812
in the the dharmic traditions
of the Indian context

547
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,049
wanted to provide that.

548
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,084
And also

549
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,120
with these images which either of you are
welcome to explore,

550
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,224
what does one hand-clapping
or a person doing

551
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,227
the splits have to do with contradiction

552
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,065
in negation? Yes.

553
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,766
Yeah.

554
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,636
I mean, regarding contradiction as well.

555
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,506
And I think this points to the kind of

556
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,743
the contextual piece,

557
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,847
the situational analysis piece is

558
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,652
there's there's the situation in inside
which

559
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,889
there's there's there's
the contradictions are constructed,

560
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,891
if that makes sense.

561
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,362
And that's also embodied
and enacted to our life.

562
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,331
So it might well be as a baby,

563
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,468
we know the morphology of the child

564
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,337
a different stages

565
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,307
in different contexts gives the ways

566
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,945
to establish situational awareness

567
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,381
and the contradictions within that

568
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,484
as things become codified.

569
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,487
So you've got these,
these, these situational

570
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,191
processes are kind of

571
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,693
what we're doing in this ongoing

572
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,530
modeling flow,
the kind of the fields of practice

573
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,934
in these different papers
that underpin them in activist

574
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,805
fields are practice or they are the more
computational fields of practice.

575
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,776
They've, they're what we kind of embody
and we get into them, we learn.

576
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,312
And that's what we're kind of intuitively
modeling in a way.

577
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,316
We get a feel for how we should model
being in these situations,

578
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,853
the contradictions,
but that modeling often

579
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:21,793
and this is the danger where it gets
overpowered by someone with their model.

580
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,862
I, someone is in their world

581
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,032
modeling what it's like to be themselves
or trying to process it.

582
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,269
They go and see a counselor
with their model

583
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,039
and that model is
being used to fit them to the model.

584
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,244
And then that counselor will tell us
what their problem is, how it's framed.

585
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,346
So I think this model of modeling

586
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,918
is quite relevant here because, you know,

587
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,088
once these contradictions
are established, it might

588
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,692
well be that there's a model created
within that domain and then someone

589
00:34:54,692 --> 00:35:00,398
who's not necessarily in that
domain can be ascribe to the model.

590
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,100
They don't know what the game is.

591
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,869
They're not in the process
and the model takes over.

592
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,370
So that sort of switches

593
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,774
over to the splits because then, okay,
we've got two things together.

594
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,778
We were talking about is this that
you open up and you've got a stance

595
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,882
of some sort and at some point it's like,
that's not a stance, brother.

596
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,249
That's that,

597
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,686
that's a split you got into that you're
going to have to be careful, right?

598
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,287
So you've gone into this idea

599
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,891
that you're opening things up
now where they one thing to start with

600
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,094
with a stance
that they were held in some ways

601
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,564
have they split in a way

602
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,235
where they're now isolated
from each other, you know,

603
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,839
and I suppose we're trying to hopefully
find a way to neither push them into one,

604
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,877
neither have split,
maybe have a stance in between

605
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,313
that is somehow agile

606
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,251
and relates in this case
to realism, instrumental ism,

607
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,287
but kind of echoes
some broad, broad themes.

608
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,823
Thank you, Dean.

609
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,893
Just real quick
on a lot of people for the yoga

610
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:06,364
Yogi Berra ism,
when you see a fork in the road, take it.

611
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,801
And I know that with the
with a lot of the the term joined

612
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,605
has come up a lot
join probability for example.

613
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,809
And so the idea of split here
is a really good one, metaphorically

614
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:23,214
speaking, because if you are looking
at something with active inference

615
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,852
and you are assuming that in a
T experiment you have to go

616
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:33,257
left or right, well, human beings
can see a fork in the road and take it.

617
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,127
That's kind of the standing joke.

618
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,230
If you see a fork in my legs, take them.

619
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,665
Don't necessarily.

620
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:45,169
You have to choose A or B,
you can take the whole thing.

621
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,907
And I think that's what Blake is trying
to point out with this exercise.

622
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,776
And so is that a contradiction?

623
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,545
No bites of utensil on the road.
I can take it.

624
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,349
But if I'm not open to the idea,
that fork doesn't

625
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,352
only mean left or right,

626
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,055
then I'm already self limited

627
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:09,393
in terms of what I am testing,
what I'm situationally analyze.

628
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:09,727
Thank you.

629
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:14,165
Both are right into the more direct
keyword pieces.

630
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,269
So in action from those definitions
dot net site

631
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,606
and actions, one of the possible ways
of organizing knowledge

632
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,309
and the forms of interaction
with the world in active knowledge

633
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:29,480
is knowledge that comes through action
and is constructed on motor skills

634
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,017
such as manipulating objects,
riding a bicycle or playing a sport.

635
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,420
That's just one of many definitions
that have been provided.

636
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,725
We've also had several
live streams and paper discussions

637
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,793
on inaction and active inference.

638
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,731
For example, in active live

639
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,834
stream number six, way back when in 2020,

640
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,371
we discussed Ramstad at all
a tale of two densities.

641
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:58,009
Active inference is an active inference.

642
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:02,513
In 2021
we discussed a paper also of Hippolyta

643
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,117
all embodied, skillful performance
where the action is.

644
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,921
And interestingly for staging
in some ways this very discussion.

645
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,990
Here's a slide from

646
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,328
that live stream

647
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,864
with of the Polito paper.

648
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:26,037
And here we had the Pearson Triad
and we had the symbolism

649
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,674
and the semiotics
and the references to French.

650
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:35,279
So we actually were talking about the
very related concept of representation

651
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,884
and indeed those who support
and or reject

652
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,586
and or find contradiction in linkage,
all of the above

653
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,458
the discussion around in activism
and the inferential accounts

654
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,528
is going to hinge
very much on the question

655
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,331
of representation
and cognitive representations.

656
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,967
What those are, where
or if they exist, and so on.

657
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,571
That was left from 23.

658
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,041
Also from this paper of Angadi at all,

659
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,144
they lay out just visually, we're going
to see more representation soon.

660
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,548
In their view,
some of the distinctions between

661
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,251
traditional social cognition
and inactive social cognition.

662
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,255
And so rather than just a visual
interpretation of the image, maybe Diem,

663
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,123
would you like to provide it?

664
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,293
No way to you done it.

665
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,095
Okay, so here, here.

666
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,265
What I see is that in the traditional
social cognitive, inferential accounts,

667
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,901
the gears are turning inside the brain.

668
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,373
And then there's perception
action loops and linkages

669
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,442
that connect social entities
that are in their body.

670
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:42,079
But the body is seen as like an interface
for that kind of information

671
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,350
transfer, one extreme stance
or simple visual representation.

672
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:51,122
And then here in contrast, we see like
the gears are everywhere, including

673
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,992
in the environment in the niche,
in the space between and that.

674
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:59,730
Yes, the brain is doing things,
but also it's part of an enacted system

675
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,733
that is implementing this in culture
social

676
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,569
cognitive process
a little bit more in a holistic framing.

677
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,271
So. Dean Yes.

678
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:07,471
Yeah.

679
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,574
I was just going to say in a minute
we're going to look at what

680
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,077
the abduction thing talks about,
but for now,

681
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,614
I would like people just to sort of
hold in their mind the idea that

682
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,950
this is speaking
to a type of temporal depth.

683
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,920
But that temporal depth is vertical.

684
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,957
I think abduction,
looking at longer timelines

685
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,293
or for hundreds of years
is more horizontal.

686
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:33,631
So just keep in mind that we're talking
temporal depth, but the focus is

687
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:37,568
on a vertical or a deep temporal depth
instead of a wide

688
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,638
lateral temporal depth.

689
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,607
So they both matter,
but they're orthogonal.

690
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,611
Doesn't mean that they're in conflict
with one another.

691
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,581
It just means they're going in
different directions.

692
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:51,949
That's all I want to say, that.

693
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,653
It's funny,
left and right or west and east.

694
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:59,990
Those are contrary directions, but
they're not negative three directions.

695
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,495
And so right there is where we start
to see like how or finality or sparsity

696
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,699
or conditional independence
granted by a markov blanket, for example,

697
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:13,204
how those can be seen in the framework
of contrary to though not negations.

698
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,071
Steven

699
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,841
that gear in the

700
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,678
in the right hand diagram there
the gear in between

701
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,915
that can have temporal depth
that can have this mind body environment

702
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,686
peace is definitely there like you say
and and obviously makes

703
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,121
as a unit of analysis
that's really challenging

704
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,625
and I would also put in there
as the gear words

705
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,028
words are a twitch

706
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:43,033
twitch in of our voice box is giving us
words in space around us.

707
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,004
So, you know,
they're being used as tools as well.

708
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,842
So suddenly we're much more enmeshed,
even if it's just speech.

709
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,211
Yeah.

710
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,446
And it takes time for the speech

711
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,282
to travel through the Internet
and through space and time.

712
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,186
A little bit
more depth on social in action.

713
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,222
This in action research

714
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,225
resource describes
several meanings and senses

715
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,962
of inaction in the performative,
in the bringing forth senses.

716
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,000
So please read
and also a really nice 2009

717
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,503
paper in cognitive semiotics
by De Bruin and Dunn

718
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,675
discuss some of the relationships
of in activism, in social cognition.

719
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,746
And they did
an excellent job of summarizing what

720
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,116
the inferential
and the in activist accounts

721
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,120
can bring together
and sort of discuss that linkage.

722
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,488
Yes, please. Dean.

723
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,591
Yeah,
I've read that paper because I found it.

724
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,459
And here's an interesting thing.

725
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,327
If they're going to use a

726
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,097
bridge metaphor,
I think an activist does have a bridge.

727
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,233
It's just a vertical bridge.

728
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,902
It's the side of a building going up.

729
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,570
And so

730
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,840
not it
not not to criticize my favorite year,

731
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,478
but I think there is a gap
and there is an ability to span.

732
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,148
It's just that it's going vertical.

733
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,251
It's not going
traditionally side to side.

734
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:09,720
Awesome.

735
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:14,458
So on to a little bit of depth
into abduction and semiotics.

736
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,264
Well, we had quite the learning journey
together

737
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:26,370
and the abduction paper
with one or one and a half

738
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,440
or even two of the authors being true
person

739
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,776
experts provided many details.

740
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,013
Pierce was a prolific writer
and thinker and collaborator,

741
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,383
and also much of the work
was unpublished, which means that

742
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,253
there are some arcane reference systems
and not all of it is hyper accessible.

743
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,158
We found the Commons work site
to be immensely useful

744
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,962
in providing many definitions,
as well as links to resources.

745
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,732
Dean, would you like to summarize
anything on this page?

746
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,302
Nothing other than if you if you

747
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:03,440
if you are interested in pragmatism
and you want to get past William

748
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,378
James, actually, William
James and Charles Pierce had a bit of a

749
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,714
they were they were maybe 150 years ago,

750
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:15,185
the first conflict years around
how things work.

751
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:20,791
It's actually really it's an amazing
takeoff point in terms of how people

752
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,925
who appear

753
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,295
to be in competition with one another
actually make one another smarter.

754
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,632
But in fact, a lot of the things
a lot of the ideas

755
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,769
that were 150 years
later are now looking back on.

756
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,337
We would have to say

757
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,205
they may have felt
they were in competition

758
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,441
with one another,
but I think what they were doing

759
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,145
was relaying or somehow
building a better part of

760
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,281
because they were always
looking at things as

761
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,484
through the same eyes,
they had both eyes open.

762
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,421
So that's
how I'll just say go to the common side.

763
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,889
It's, it's good.

764
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,625
Yeah, it's great. This representation,

765
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,062
ironically,

766
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,299
appropriately, is of the well known
Pearson triad

767
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:06,136
semiotic framework, where a stop sign
is called the representation,

768
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,674
the represented instance, the physical
stop sign, the real stop sign.

769
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,945
The object is the message
cars must stop here

770
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,015
and the interpreted is
I should stop here.

771
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,751
And so that's where we get that entity
agency.

772
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,087
I found a interesting paper

773
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,223
about the user interface,

774
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,726
which brings some of these truly timeless

775
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,730
discussions on semiotics and logic
into a digital context.

776
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,800
They're applying that same meiosis
to the user interface metaphor.

777
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,170
One could imagine if that were
a stop sign in the real world,

778
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,440
or if it were a button on a website
in a user interface context.

779
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:47,845
And anyone may pause
and read some of these

780
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:51,815
very excellent selections from quotes and

781
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,752
lectures given

782
00:45:54,752 --> 00:46:00,190
on how copies, signs and symbols
are linked through logic and some meiosis

783
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,762
lot here, but we'll carry on to abduction
specifically.

784
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,998
So this was a little bit on Pierce
and the definition

785
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,869
of semiotics
as opposed to the science of things.

786
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,172
The more positive sciences
and the science of forms

787
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,575
which are the more formal sciences,

788
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,644
what is abductor of reasoning?

789
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,580
This was very fascinating to explore.

790
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,883
This is a quote from the abduction paper

791
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,186
they wrote It is common
in the secondary literature, e.g.

792
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,990
that building on Pierce
to conceive abduction as occurring

793
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,960
in two parts or two kinds
generative abduction

794
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,997
and selective abduction.

795
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,766
Here's
another perspective on the two types

796
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,336
or the two varietals or two components
to stroke engine of abduction

797
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,673
from the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

798
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,676
They wrote
in the philosophical literature,

799
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:56,079
The term abduction is used in two related
but different senses.

800
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,583
In both senses,
the term refers to explanatory reasoning

801
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,553
in the historically first sense.

802
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:08,525
It refers to the place of explanatory
reasoning in generating hypotheses

803
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,360
that's generative abduction,

804
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,496
while in the second sense,
which is the sense

805
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,032
which it is used
most frequently in the modern literature,

806
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:19,503
it refers to the place of explanatory
reasoning, justifying

807
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,006
or evaluating
in enumerated set of hypotheses.

808
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,376
And in a sense, it makes it makes sense.

809
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,782
The content has to be generated
to be curated, the ideas have to be

810
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:36,153
specified, enumerated
in order to be justified

811
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,356
or evaluated.

812
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,859
Dean, please continue on this.

813
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,827
Well, just just real quickly.

814
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,964
So we now have red and blue,
which was really,

815
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,566
really important to highlight,
that you need both

816
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:54,571
you need a minimum of two
for the explanation to appear

817
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,740
next deductive reasoning

818
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,210
and probabilistic sense, also known
as difference to the best explanation,

819
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:05,282
is a form of logical reason
that looks to the most likely hypothesis.

820
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,919
To explain something in an example,
did two white beans in the left hand

821
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,855
come from the bag of objects
held in the right hand?

822
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,458
Here we can see how the hypothesis
put forward.

823
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,729
Depends on an incomplete observation
or an inference.

824
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,731
Are there beans also in the bag?

825
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:25,035
And even if so, is that the source
for what has been transferred

826
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,303
to the left hand?

827
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,538
So again, temporal depth

828
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,042
when you arrive into a situation,

829
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,780
what what kind of background
and what kind of context do you possess

830
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:41,618
is going to go to this
this fourth form of logic or purse,

831
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:46,490
literally spent a lifetime
trying to defend a tangle

832
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,493
and then reform
into some sort of coherence.

833
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,729
And those listening

834
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:57,834
along may start to see inklings
of priors, sensory observations,

835
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:02,205
posterior updating of beliefs
about the world, even action selection

836
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:07,711
coming into play, especially translation
of the affordances, instantaneous action

837
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:12,282
availabilities into policies
which can be evaluated by their expected

838
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,384
free energy.
But we're going to get there.

839
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,620
Let's turn to abduction.

840
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,958
And here are some of the very fascinating
papers available on comments

841
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,593
related to abduction lot there.

842
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,931
And to kind of continue on
with one of the resources from comments

843
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,234
on abduction as practical inference

844
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:36,406
by Thomas Capitan, this work,

845
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,143
which we're not going to read
everything about, goes into a lot of

846
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,715
interesting points
about that dual nature of abduction

847
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,250
with hypothesis generating

848
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:51,655
and hypothesis selection
and distinguishes

849
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,860
that hypothesis selection
can make deductively valid evaluations.

850
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,731
However,
the creativity phase is non inferential

851
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,734
and that has a lot of resonance
with like not three censoring ideas

852
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:08,972
and having like an inclusive discussion
when brainstorming and recognizing

853
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:14,911
that there has to be a winnowing
in a finite period of space and time.

854
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,314
Additionally,
there's some discussion here.

855
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,316
This was

856
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,852
relating as we move back towards

857
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,422
or interweave with free energy principle.

858
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:30,594
Initial awareness of the hypothesis comes
with the observation of a call negated

859
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:34,297
whole by means of an uncontrolled insight
into the world of ideas

860
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:40,470
into what he called
third ness as given in perception.

861
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,875
The novel conceiving of any instance
of premise to citing a previous

862
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:50,280
part of paper is caused by prior
cognitions, hashtag priors.

863
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,682
Its content is suggested by the facts,

864
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,452
observations, sensory observations,

865
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,756
but not everything suggested is inferred
from the cognition of the facts.

866
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:04,594
And so Peirce goes on to describe
there are operations of the mind

867
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:09,399
which are logically exactly
analogous to inferences, excepting

868
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,035
only that they are unconscious
and therefore uncontrollable

869
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,337
and therefore not subject to criticism.

870
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,239
So leaving aside questions

871
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,309
like whether unconscious processes
can be considered controllable

872
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,947
here, we very much see hints
of perception as unconscious inference,

873
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:28,752
and we see also continuity
between processes of attention

874
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,388
and awareness, conscious inferences

875
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,658
and other subconscious inferences.

876
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:38,628
And so in a way, this is also providing
an integrated framework

877
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,598
perception, learning, belief, updating,

878
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,734
temporal depth, conscious
and unconscious awareness.

879
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,139
All these features are explored
in the person work

880
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:53,910
and the abduction paper is going
to very specifically highlight that fact.

881
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,413
Okay. Carrying on a little bit more

882
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,182
abduction and

883
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:02,786
retro duction, would you like to add
anything on this one? Dean

884
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,792
Well, I mean, people
that study and analyze this,

885
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,761
I wonder at times whether or not this was

886
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,998
a morphology

887
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,634
or whether or not
we can use the two terms

888
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,971
simultaneously or interchangeably.

889
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,876
Again, it's probably one of those things
where if you want to find out

890
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,211
what the details are,
you should probably go and have a look

891
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,781
because it's interesting,
but it doesn't at this point.

892
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,351
Are we basically want to do is

893
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,988
care I'll just read is

894
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,024
that your duction of the process
whereby from a surprise memory of facts

895
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:45,896
we are led to a conjectural in conjecture
lot theory to account for them.

896
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,599
Many logicians
refuse to call this last inference

897
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,203
because its conclusion is so excellent,
extremely problematical

898
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,106
as to amount
to little more than an interrogation.

899
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:57,674
I'm sure they're wrong.

900
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,676
However, they have not possessed

901
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,113
themselves of the true scientific
definition of inference.

902
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:07,184
So what he's basically saying here is
let's not call

903
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,886
abduct of reasoning, inference,

904
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,858
inductive
reasoning, the logical justification

905
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,959
of a retro doctrine,

906
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:19,963
of which the preclusion is that
the conjecture state of things is likely.

907
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,735
The vague sense of tended to resemble
the real state of things.

908
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,804
And this is the part where.

909
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,540
So what replaces that instrumental ism?

910
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:36,146
Whatever, whatever we define
as instrumental ism, this is again,

911
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,982
this is one of those conundrums.

912
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,251
If it's not if it's not

913
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,955
real state, is it?

914
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,156
What is it then.

915
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,392
What is an unreal or a non real state

916
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,995
because it's there we've labeled it.

917
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,097
What, what feels that.

918
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:58,568
What feels that eventually to make
the whole that's the question here.

919
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,473
And also again
worthwhile reading some of the prior

920
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,376
work of one of the authors
of the abduction paper.

921
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,513
And one can see in their research
a strong line

922
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,316
of developing and extending
and modernizing a lot of the work.

923
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,852
Let's yeah.

924
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,721
So I put down those bear signs

925
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,923
because I want to tell a really,
really, really quick story.

926
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,060
So if you live somewhere
where there are bears

927
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:28,131
at the bear
sign stays up, people begin to ignore

928
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:33,637
the actual sign object
and they no longer become interprets.

929
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:39,776
They they willfully lose that triadic
so if you're in the business

930
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,480
of, of animal welfare

931
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,549
and you don't want bears become too

932
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,352
used to human contact,

933
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,022
you have to be very selective
when you put the sign up

934
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,991
and most importantly
when you remove the sign.

935
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,428
So I wanted to put that out there
because that's a big part

936
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,997
of the objective and retrospection piece.

937
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:06,503
It's you have to sometimes
take things away for abduction to work.

938
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:11,775
It's the removal of possibilities
that actually creates an emphasis.

939
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,512
I think we'll just carry on to realism

940
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,280
and instrumental ism
because we're going to come back

941
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,482
to abduction
in the subsequent discussions.

942
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,719
More so, here are some quotes
from a fair event paper.

943
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,656
According to realism, such knowledge
factual

944
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,360
knowledge is descriptive of general
or particular features of the universe.

945
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:34,864
So that doesn't mean
that the model of gravity is gravity,

946
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,601
doesn't mean that the model of gravity
is what the objects of gravity are.

947
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,273
But a realist would remark that,
for example, formal models of gravity

948
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:48,578
teach us of the existence of objects
acted upon by the force.

949
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:53,316
Gravity and license the description
of a force which cannot be directly seen,

950
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,320
heard or felt
but still has noticeable influence.

951
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,190
Forces are real. Things are real

952
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,760
according to instrumental ism.

953
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,497
Even a theory that is wholly correct
does not describe anything, but serves

954
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,431
as an instrument

955
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,601
for the prediction of the facts
that constitute its empirical contents.

956
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,071
And so, again, on this Newton's
gravitation example,

957
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:19,142
the instrumentalist could take
the position there are no entities.

958
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:23,913
Gravitation, force and gravitational
fields are merely instrumental

959
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:27,951
applications of statistical arguments

960
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,287
or potentially even social
or power dynamical arguments.

961
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,924
And IT instrumentalists
may deny the existence of objects,

962
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,960
entities and forces.

963
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,463
In this case,
and even take things to the level

964
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:45,301
of having skepticism around words
as instruments and the relationships

965
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:50,039
around communication and how it orders
and predicts sense data.

966
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:54,811
We've explored realism in instrumental
ism quite a lot over the streams,

967
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:59,783
and we highlighted a lot in Mel
Andrews work in Live Stream Number 14,

968
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,453
one more
slide on realism and instrumental ism

969
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:07,323
and then either of you, please feel free.

970
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,759
All Describe
some of the bottom once again.

971
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,962
The map territory distinction is very key

972
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:17,167
to the real ism
and instrumental ism conversation.

973
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,037
There's also been a variety of excellent
philosophical work.

974
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,476
For example, a successor to the realism
anti realism question.

975
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:30,180
Those two, by the way, I would say,
are indications, whereas realism

976
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,017
and instrumental ism we are suggesting
might be seen as contrary.

977
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,921
And also Helen Long,
Eno's work on scientific pluralism

978
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:42,392
has a lot to say about this
by taking a multidisciplinary

979
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:46,563
lens on realism and instrumental ism,
and then, Dean, would you like

980
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:52,335
to describe anything about this top paper
you found? Oh,

981
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,506
I don't remember this in the grand scheme
of things, to be honest.

982
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,208
It's here for people to read.

983
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,411
There were many papers and again,
we're just putting a lot of text up

984
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,479
for those who want to pause

985
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,282
and follow the trails
and it all kind of gets enmeshed in.

986
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:12,789
Steven Any comments on realism,
instrumentals, them?

987
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,859
I suppose the piece that I come to mind
for me

988
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,262
a lot is all of this is that underpins

989
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,532
within action at some level.

990
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,769
So the the the idea of looking for

991
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:31,140
different contradict tions or different

992
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,744
retro approaches

993
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,181
could be a case of you imagine

994
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,584
when someone thinks about taking a path
through the woods,

995
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,556
you know, or you could
we embody a lot of these things or

996
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:51,094
and maybe everything at some level
is, is goes through some embodiment.

997
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,465
And when it's conceptual,
that embodiment is just happening

998
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,935
in a more conceptual space that doesn't

999
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:02,372
rely on as many other

1000
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,709
kind of stories
or feeling your way through things.

1001
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,381
So the the difference that happens
when you're in a field of practice

1002
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,183
is that you're so used to being in
that field of practice that

1003
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:19,322
that embodiment becomes
the water that you swim in.

1004
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:23,493
And so that could be something
that sort of relates to this.

1005
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,362
Break just in.

1006
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,230
Just real quick.

1007
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,468
So again, we'll ask at this point,
yes to realism,

1008
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,439
yes to instrumental ism, yes

1009
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,542
to the end, night or

1010
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,145
under.

1011
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,682
We had a little ampersand here
and we emphasized that.

1012
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:46,950
And here

1013
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,420
one brief note on for E cognition,

1014
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:56,359
you won't go into depth here,
but for E can refer to as per the shavo

1015
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,829
and von der Schiff 2018 paper,
which was in the context

1016
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:04,067
of music pedagogy,
which is a very fascinating area for E is

1017
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,438
embodied embedded embedded,
extended, enacted

1018
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,641
in cultured, etc., etc., etc.

1019
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,544
seven e 11 e, 22 e all of them.

1020
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,447
And then a fun quote from Karl Friston

1021
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,051
from our Applied Active Inference
Symposium in 2021.

1022
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,188
He said, One key thing about active
inference

1023
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:29,192
is it's it's beyond predictive
processing, it's beyond sentiments.

1024
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,995
And it emphasizes or reflects
the pragmatic turn

1025
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,798
at the beginning of this century,
really epitomized by the four E's

1026
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,801
to make it clear that sentence is active

1027
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,572
and that you are talking
about the circular causality

1028
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:46,743
of engagement with any particle, personal
or with whatever is out there,

1029
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:50,446
purple, circular causality
and all of that entails.

1030
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,584
Then quite briefly, we're not going to go
into any of these details,

1031
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,521
but here's a bunch of work
that's relevance for the inactive paper,

1032
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:02,425
just some of the other
background citations and other work

1033
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,429
that one might want to look into
and the objective paper

1034
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,633
and also a little bit of leaning
even into something

1035
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:15,271
hopefully the authors can unpack for us
on the the role and relationship

1036
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,275
of Nominalism with all of this,
but many previous papers

1037
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:23,179
by the authors here listed
and a lot of great work here

1038
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,882
and so thanks to
you fellows for this journey.

1039
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:29,652
Now we can enter into the two papers

1040
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,956
or the space between.

1041
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:37,794
Let's have an initial juxtaposition
of the two papers I'll put.

1042
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,229
Our video will be the tip of the iceberg
here.

1043
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,231
So, Dean, you're the tip of the iceberg.

1044
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,667
What would you like to say
about these two papers?

1045
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:49,138
In an initial juxtaposition?

1046
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:52,742
Well, as I said,
I think if you actually step back

1047
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,511
and realize that what people are doing by

1048
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,681
by pairing two to active influence,

1049
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,652
you are saying I have I have a particular

1050
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,489
kind of situational analysis
that I would like to perform.

1051
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,860
And in doing so, I would like to try
to remove contradictions

1052
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,996
or I would like
to formulate integrations.

1053
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,100
And if you step back to that, place

1054
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,571
your your example of so your your hyper,

1055
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:27,810
your hyper, your how your subject is is

1056
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:29,545
situational

1057
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,381
analysis, your example getting under that

1058
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:36,552
you're
not now making the mistake of saying,

1059
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:42,158
my way of looking at things
automatically negates or or turns

1060
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,261
to other ways of looking at everything
that's under that title.

1061
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,598
A Situation Situational Analysis to Dust.

1062
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:53,469
Now there are comparisons and they're not
written here and they're already law.

1063
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,373
And I just basically chose examples
within each of the papers

1064
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:02,411
where papers are talking
about two different focal points, but

1065
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:07,683
they're still within this larger, larger
marginal boundary of active inference.

1066
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,419
And how active inference is behaving

1067
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,523
around the behavior

1068
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:18,728
within a regime of attention
and opening that up to something

1069
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:22,832
more available then the specifics
or the scale friendly thing of

1070
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:27,603
does theory of mind
necessarily blend with active interest?

1071
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,907
Or does the idea that abduction

1072
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,744
the moment when I arrive, actually negate

1073
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,580
any possibility of using instruments

1074
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,650
to extend my my sensory window?

1075
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:41,751
Right.

1076
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:46,155
So again, not going to spend a whole lot
of time pulling those other things out.

1077
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,126
But if people want to actually see how
when you set approximately

1078
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:54,330
two papers beside one another,
you can find a ton of similarities.

1079
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,333
It's a kind of an interesting exercise.

1080
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,403
It takes a while, but
when you actually see them side by each

1081
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,706
and entangled, there's a
there's a lot of braiding going on.

1082
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,342
Thank you, Dave.

1083
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,143
Steven

1084
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,047
yeah I like this

1085
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:14,016
like with theme is talking about that
you've got these two papers

1086
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:18,754
it could almost be seen as two icebergs
where the philosophies

1087
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:22,825
have kind of frozen and given
shape and form and there is stuff

1088
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:27,663
underneath and stuff above, but
there's also the water around in between,

1089
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:32,435
which may have lots of shrimp
and all sorts of things strewn around.

1090
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:37,573
So I think in this this list here, we've
kind of got realism, instrumental ism,

1091
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:41,911
whether you two icebergs
or we want them to be nice and sharp

1092
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,948
and maybe you get knocked a bit
if you bang off them.

1093
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:50,820
And then your case and model comparison,
you know,

1094
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,790
they they're still out there,
but they might jive a little bit.

1095
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,959
Multi-agent belief, communication.

1096
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,128
Hold on. We've got something flowing
here.

1097
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:03,432
Things is assembles ensemble
so a model is ensembles

1098
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,136
perspective or size

1099
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:10,172
perspective of where
those perspectives coming from.

1100
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,942
Why is it now in
stochastic AC complex systems

1101
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,379
and so forth?

1102
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:21,617
We're now maybe I don't know,
we're not dissolving the iceberg

1103
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,419
if that's not about that
the iceberg there.

1104
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,355
But we're there different types of

1105
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:32,495
ways and of starting to
maybe be more flexible

1106
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,565
and less stable.

1107
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,233
Awesome.

1108
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,936
So into the inactive paper we go.

1109
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:45,841
So to keep things reasonable
and also have a lot to discuss

1110
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,745
in the one and two, again,
we've put a lot of content

1111
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,748
onto the slides
for your pausing and enjoying.

1112
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,350
Most of the content

1113
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,321
is copied and quoted from the papers,
so that is the point of reference.

1114
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:03,225
To learn more, we'll just walk through
in the order of the roadmap,

1115
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,462
some of the key pieces that the papers
go through.

1116
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:10,166
So in Section one of the inactive paper,

1117
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:15,004
they're going to begin
with a summarization of this year

1118
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:18,541
at Ul's 2020 argument
for understanding others in the world.

1119
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,011
And that's presented in this thinking
through other minds

1120
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,548
to on paper
and then Tom is theory of mind.

1121
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,484
They summarize

1122
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,488
or capture the arguments of thinking
through other minds as one

1123
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,225
premise,
one social cognition is an active

1124
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,761
in embodied two and active and embodied.

1125
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:43,132
The social actor cannot directly
grasp social cognition.

1126
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,636
Three Anything that cannot be directly
grasped must be inferred.

1127
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,673
Ergo, QED conclusion

1128
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:55,177
in active and embodied
social cognition must be inferred.

1129
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,614
There must be inference
about social cognition,

1130
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:03,519
and the authors of the inactive paper
state that by premise

1131
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,124
two and 32m joins the two M orthodoxy.

1132
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,394
Understanding the world
and others to them

1133
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:16,165
comes down to the ability
to infer and attribute mental states.

1134
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:21,504
That is the summarization
of thinking through other minds

1135
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,540
and they are going to call into question

1136
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,510
on this critical dissection
that such a t to m

1137
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:32,248
account is indeed making this happy
marriage with an activism

1138
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,452
they're going to poll on. Yes.

1139
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,921
And anyone or continue. Okay.

1140
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,056
They're going to they're going to

1141
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,559
they're going to pull out
on a few different of these premises

1142
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,664
and what hidden assumptions
might be underlying those premises.

1143
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:52,201
Like what axioms lead one to generate
such premises.

1144
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,471
The contradiction
between P1 and P2 results

1145
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,574
from two hidden assumptions
in that two argument.

1146
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,410
So here we see P one, two, three above

1147
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,113
and then hidden assumption
one Social cognition

1148
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:07,583
reduces to information
in explicit propositional form,

1149
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,786
mental representation and description.

1150
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,721
They are going to say this.

1151
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,724
They are feeling this way
as a mental representation

1152
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,528
and hidden assumption to social cognition
is hardwired

1153
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,731
with the concepts and logical tools
for inference.

1154
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:27,736
For example, at birth
and in the subsequent sections,

1155
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,071
they're going to analyze

1156
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,842
and clarify the contradiction
between premises one and two.

1157
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:37,246
This tension of if social cognition
is an active and embodied,

1158
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,516
is it really the case,
or is it a contradictory claim

1159
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:44,653
that social cognition cannot be directly
grasped by such a social actor?

1160
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:46,589
They're then

1161
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,758
going to critically assess
from the inactive perspective

1162
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:53,329
what problems might underlie
these assumption, the hidden assumptions

1163
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:57,166
and why, and activists
reject these hidden assumptions

1164
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,169
and hence reject
the premises listed above

1165
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,607
and they're going to be exploring
what are these non

1166
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:08,444
representational methods and mechanisms

1167
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:12,348
of code construction in social action.

1168
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:16,785
They have a mark of blanket,
a representation visually

1169
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,091
that we've seen here before
with the internal states external states

1170
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,628
and the mediation of internal
and external states by blanket states

1171
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:31,500
which as per the Perl 1988
definition, are the blanket states

1172
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,371
making the internal and external states
conditionally independent.

1173
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,041
Sometimes people go further and describe
a friston blanket

1174
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,077
where the blanket states are partitioned

1175
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,648
into two kinds of states
sense and active.

1176
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:50,319
And those two kinds of states
are defined by their incoming

1177
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,657
from the perspective of internal states,
statistical dependencies,

1178
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:55,791
sensory states,

1179
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,828
and outgoing statistical dependencies,
which can be interpreted as actions

1180
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:04,233
or interface, is from the entity
or thing towards the neish.

1181
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:09,805
But we'll come back to Mark on blankets
and more later.

1182
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,507
Yes, Steven, go for it.

1183
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:15,010
Just coming back to that
actually the page, the slide before this,

1184
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:19,381
but relating to this is
when it says things cannot be directly.

1185
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,684
There's a couple of things
that directly be grasped.

1186
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:26,021
Well, I would argue that with that,
that's a useful distinction,

1187
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:30,125
because when we think about what
we're talking about, the grip

1188
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:33,963
and the grip to a pair of pliers
and I can't directly grip a hot point.

1189
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,799
I need the pliers. I can't directly

1190
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:38,701
to a number of

1191
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,737
things without maybe more than one tools.

1192
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:45,541
But there's a sense that

1193
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,712
when we talk about grasping things
or when people are thinking about

1194
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:56,151
if something is to grasp something
that is explicitly oppositional,

1195
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:02,424
you know, we have other kinds of tools
that might be come into play

1196
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:07,529
even when we think about words
and the act of ascribing

1197
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,133
all these things can be

1198
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,769
performances with tools at every level.

1199
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,006
So there's a there's an interesting
blending going on here.

1200
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,808
It's dependent
on how the iceberg gets melted.

1201
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,846
Great in section two one,

1202
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:29,118
which you can read in the paper or pause
here and capture many aspects of it,

1203
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,755
they're going to question the assumption
that social cognition reduces

1204
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:37,826
to mental representation and their point
can be distilled as understanding.

1205
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,597
Others is a matter of being skilled
at shared non explicit meanings

1206
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,700
and potentially some abductors.

1207
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,736
Ding, ding,
ding and model based reasoning,

1208
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:51,840
all of which are context, specific,
modifiable and dynamic.

1209
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,411
And they are going to unpack
in the further paragraphs

1210
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,313
that in there in lies

1211
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,349
in evident contradiction
between those first two premises,

1212
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:03,786
which is really like the Achilles
heel or the soft spot where they're going

1213
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,387
to be targeting their logic

1214
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,056
in section two.

1215
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,292
Two, they're going to question
that second of the assumptions,

1216
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:13,162
which is that social
cognition is hardwired from birth.

1217
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:17,499
And so while they do
qualify the term position

1218
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,170
and they say, Vasya,
do not hold a nativist position,

1219
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,540
for example,
like a pure inborn perspective,

1220
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,676
because they do have a focus
on the developmental

1221
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,113
and ecological dynamics
of how culture is acquired.

1222
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,818
They do call into question
the acquisition of the starter pack

1223
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,555
and they are also
exploring more in this section.

1224
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:43,559
Some and activist critiques
of, for example, hardwired

1225
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,661
perspectives on social cognition

1226
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,465
in Section three,

1227
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:52,935
having critiqued assumptions
that in their mind highlight

1228
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:56,372
the contradiction inherent
within thinking through other minds,

1229
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,375
they're going to suggest
another relationship.

1230
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,244
Oh, you don't like that dish?

1231
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,812
Let's try this one.

1232
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,782
And this is going to be a approach

1233
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,652
Dynamical Systems Theory or DST,
they write.

1234
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:15,491
DST, as we shall argue in
this section, is an approach that serves

1235
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:19,194
to learn about and generate
predictive power about the socio

1236
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,898
culturally situated practices of agents
constructing their niche.

1237
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,401
Because DST

1238
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,704
has at its core useful tools
such as emergence,

1239
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,241
nonlinearity and spontaneity, etc.

1240
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:37,546
It allows us to move away
from prefabricated notions, time

1241
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:40,149
theory of mind,
like theories of social cognition.

1242
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,320
One should therefore refrain
from making ontological assumptions.

1243
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:49,224
Ontological here,
being about how things are in the world.

1244
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,261
So more of the philosophers ontology

1245
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,565
rather than the computer science
knowledge management sense of ontology.

1246
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,233
One should refrain
from making these kinds

1247
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,069
of ontological assumptions
licensed by realism

1248
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,341
about the complex system
based upon the tractable model.

1249
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:10,946
So just because the model is so tractable
doesn't mean that we have the license

1250
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,449
to make ontological assumptions.

1251
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,252
Since the tractable model
is an opportunity for learning

1252
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,856
about the complex behavior,
only epistemic claims are allowed.

1253
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,726
Let us take a closer
look at the claim to make it tractable.

1254
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:29,097
We can represent a dynamical system
by a static relationship as follows

1255
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:33,368
and here are their equations one,
two and three with the captions below.

1256
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,806
And they're using these very simple
kind of like the kernel

1257
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,643
of the dynamical systems
theory is understanding how

1258
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,781
things are, a function of how they change

1259
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,551
broadly, and it's represented
in a few different ways

1260
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,256
in terms of a successor model
and more of a ray of change model.

1261
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:55,924
Stephen

1262
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:00,128
I think this is a very useful point.

1263
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,932
Point number three there,
the bullet point, because it also speaks

1264
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,000
to that sense.

1265
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,803
So this is a model in approach.

1266
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,673
Let's see what the modeling is telling us

1267
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,877
rather than a model fitting approach,

1268
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:18,180
which is often what ends up happening.

1269
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,451
If you have the defined ontology,
you know, you effectively

1270
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,054
pre assume so many things. So

1271
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,491
that's maybe a key piece

1272
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,195
that links a lot
of how things can be bridged

1273
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,064
in terms of active inference
and how it could be held between,

1274
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:39,334
you know, that that is a

1275
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:44,406
is a stance in a way,
is holding the legs apart and saying,

1276
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:49,111
okay, I'm not doing the split,
so I've got my legs together, right?

1277
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,814
So let's find out than you.

1278
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,983
Someone expert tell me

1279
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,654
and. Yeah, thanks.

1280
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,856
Thank you, Dean. Yes.

1281
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:02,991
And I just want to add to
what Stephen was just saying

1282
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:04,860
up to this point.

1283
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,696
I really and I love the paper

1284
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:12,167
that it's the constructivist piece,
though that I think

1285
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:14,970
has me

1286
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:19,408
pausing for a minute,
because I believe that in order for us

1287
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,144
to be able to make that decision,

1288
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,180
is it the splits or is it a fork?

1289
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:29,084
Is it literally a fork and split
instead of having go left or right?

1290
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,021
That requires a deconstruct
actually that I think is oftentimes

1291
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,924
left out prior to a reconstruction.

1292
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,694
So, again,
I'm not arguing with the argument

1293
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,729
because I think
they're respecting the autonomy

1294
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:44,166
and I think they've done
a brilliant job of saying, okay,

1295
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:48,337
this logic, this deductive path
that other authors have taken

1296
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,507
may not necessarily apply here
because it causes too much blending.

1297
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,309
So good, good, good.

1298
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,813
You're you're holding up
what actually is left and right,

1299
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,783
but you're leaving out the at the
and part is it

1300
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,052
could be a fork that I could
literally pick up.

1301
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,022
And the only way you can see that
is if you can deconstruct

1302
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:11,059
before you reconstruct and deconstruct
doesn't mean differentiate

1303
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,794
that's already present.

1304
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,798
Deconstruct
literally means just as the weirdness.

1305
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,935
When did I arrive? In this moment?

1306
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:20,535
What have I?

1307
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,438
What what parts of the puzzle
am I still missing?

1308
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:28,677
Because I'm in a hurry to figure out
if I'm supposed to go left

1309
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:34,116
or right next, especially in social
context, especially there.

1310
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,253
Yes. Stephen, if
you would like to give me the point here.

1311
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,922
Thanks. You're just adding to that

1312
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,192
that piece of the situation on this.

1313
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:49,798
I'm believes that's where you come
into the weirdness of what's on.

1314
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,167
So science is very much telling us
what's going on.

1315
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,835
What is this thing?

1316
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,971
What is this?

1317
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,406
What is that?

1318
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,475
That fork in, the road of being,

1319
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:04,212
you know, a t t maize junction
or something else.

1320
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,949
Ultimately there's a win in space.

1321
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:12,320
Where is that situated
and in active inference that's often more

1322
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,323
complex and nebulous

1323
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:19,227
with the scientific
being about the accuracy of the method.

1324
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,864
Well, at the time, as awareness
and the complexity comes in,

1325
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,901
acting inference can have both of those.

1326
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:28,870
Right continuing on through the latter
parts of the paper.

1327
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:34,743
They talk a lot about complexity,
which many of us love.

1328
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,746
So complexity, complexity,
science, complexity

1329
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:40,082
theory bring so many great

1330
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:44,753
turns, concepts, people, methods, tools,
ideas, everything.

1331
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:49,191
And they talk a lot about other polices
and this recursive ness.

1332
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,662
There's a lot of really creative linkage
linkages made in the inactive paper,

1333
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,466
and complexity
is used in a really valuable way.

1334
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,967
In Section four.

1335
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,704
They're going to move into active
inference in an inactive dynamic setting,

1336
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:04,306
and that

1337
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,842
is where active inference is going to be

1338
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,847
as an insightful instruments
to learn about and understand

1339
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,683
the dynamics underlying cultural
co constructions,

1340
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:18,820
considering it does necessarily
take agents as passive

1341
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,891
agents together are the authors
of the states of one another

1342
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:28,697
and so kind of analogous to the inactive
figures shown earlier

1343
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,967
where we had the gears in the head
and then that went to like the gears

1344
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,704
being more distributed in the body
and in the mind here in Fig.

1345
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:40,776
two, there's more of a classical meaning
and model based reasoning

1346
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:45,180
where different social actors are kind
of having this inferential account

1347
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,184
that very like one directional
as shown here with an arrow pointing

1348
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,385
just to the middle.

1349
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:54,089
And in figure three, they're depicting
the social action in FIG.

1350
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:58,460
two under active inference
in terms of labeling here,

1351
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,696
the internal states
of the social actor too,

1352
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,699
and the external states
being social actor.

1353
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:08,470
One So this is from the perspective of,
of social actor to where

1354
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,541
the blanket states are being framed
as socio cultural meaning.

1355
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:17,579
And that model based reasoning
which opens up for inferential accounts

1356
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:21,216
that are distributed and enacted and

1357
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,219
hopefully will go into

1358
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:29,491
more detail because this is where
they are supporting their positive

1359
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,962
instrumentalist application of active
inference into the social inactive space

1360
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,064
and then they write.

1361
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:39,568
Characterizing a social scene
as analogous to scientific practice

1362
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,237
is thereby a mischaracterization.

1363
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:45,473
It's almost like taking
what happens in the laboratory

1364
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,210
in a certain context
and even a certain view

1365
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,012
on what happens in the laboratory
in a certain context,

1366
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:54,115
comma in a certain context,

1367
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,184
and then critiquing that

1368
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,188
and thinking a bit more expansively
about what happens in the hallways,

1369
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,625
in the laboratory, and in the basement
and in the world around the building.

1370
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,830
And that is also really nicely connected
to some other Bromberg at all.

1371
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:12,400
So work on the anticipating brain
is not a scientist,

1372
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,203
which also focuses on
the inactive perspective

1373
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:19,174
from an ecological perspective,
not only necessarily the social,

1374
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,009
but the social is an important case

1375
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,180
in table one.

1376
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,083
They're going to discuss
a little bit more

1377
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:32,821
about some of the dividers
and contents of cells

1378
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:36,791
related to the natural world
and scientific tools and constructs

1379
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:38,326
for sure.

1380
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,096
We're going to return here
in subsequent discussion.

1381
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,666
So just check out table one,
see what you think.

1382
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,501
What other lines would you draw?

1383
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,471
Would they be kind of like curved lines,
like look like letters?

1384
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,340
Would you circle anything?
Would you draw some triangles?

1385
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,843
Would you add another row?
Would you make it a tensor?

1386
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,711
What else would you draw on?

1387
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,079
Table one

1388
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,417
even if only another double bounding line
to emphasize that it's perfect.

1389
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,019
Does this then.

1390
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:07,322
All I would say
is if you do go and have a look at this,

1391
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:12,661
ask yourself why these hyper parameters
and why these laterals?

1392
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,463
Because I think that will

1393
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,400
that will lead
to all kinds of well, for me,

1394
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:22,070
it just got so twisted around this one.

1395
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,038
Okay.

1396
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,840
And then conclusion,
before we move to the second paper,

1397
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:31,046
we have shown that holding
both in activism and theory of mind

1398
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:35,250
entails contradiction and confusion.

1399
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,520
This is evident
when we critically dissect the two hidden

1400
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,325
assumptions held by two and like theories
such as Tom, which are rejected by in

1401
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:46,428
activism, those two cover assumptions

1402
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,230
that they believe disrepute, the linkage,

1403
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:54,869
and then they reiterate
the constructive nature and the embedded

1404
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:59,841
in the ecological components
of social and action and the recursion

1405
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:04,879
and the unfolding through time,
the rolling out of social and action.

1406
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:08,883
And they suggest that dynamical systems
theory and active inference

1407
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:12,420
instrumentally applied
as a type of dynamical systems

1408
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,656
modeling has promise

1409
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,726
and is a suitable and complementary tool

1410
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,796
to consider social understanding
as generalized synchronization

1411
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,967
held in a certain way.

1412
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:29,471
So that was that paper, and it will now

1413
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:32,474
be paired with the objective paper.

1414
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,643
So one breath before we move into

1415
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:39,748
abduction. Yes.

1416
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:42,650
Even taking that breath,

1417
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,721
that last sentence there
about how it can be

1418
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,259
almost a bridge
there, that the complementary

1419
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:57,032
use of dynamical systems theory
sort of fills a gap there.

1420
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,299
So fill in the gap.

1421
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,269
And in a way,
I think as we to at the adduction paper

1422
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,472
some of the gaps that doesn't well,

1423
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:05,173
I know we're not trying

1424
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,609
to talk about filling gaps here,
but let's say we're filling gaps.

1425
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,879
Abduction might also feel

1426
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,749
so, you know, the the beauty
of the beauty of active inference

1427
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,385
and the Bayesian approach
is that lots different

1428
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:20,989
scales and modalities

1429
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:24,092
can be weighted and blended to give you

1430
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,363
potentially a feel for what to do.

1431
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:28,897
Right.

1432
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,934
So also doesn't mean one excludes
the other.

1433
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,970
Awesome. Okay.

1434
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:40,075
Into abduct when we abuse

1435
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,645
away.

1436
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:49,017
The paper begins with a relatively short
and very concise

1437
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,520
introduction
to some of the key points of the paper

1438
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,624
we described earlier in their aims
that they're interested

1439
01:24:56,624 --> 01:25:00,328
in this naturalistic rendering
of some of C.S.

1440
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:02,530
Pierce's later, e.g.

1441
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,500
post 1903 or post 1905,

1442
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:10,472
mostly unpublished work
unpacking the semiotic

1443
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:15,443
and logical notions, objective reasoning
which we covered in the context section.

1444
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:19,647
They're aiming
for this biological model of abduction,

1445
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,051
which is going to

1446
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:26,254
thread the needle,
weave the fabric, whatever it is

1447
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,491
that maintains
the functional integrity of the organism,

1448
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,828
the evolutionary imperative
for that living beings existence,

1449
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:39,400
and to be compatible
with modern neuroscience.

1450
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,937
They focus on the allegiance and the
alliance, which we talked about earlier,

1451
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:47,308
and they're all introduced
also in the introduction, the Markov

1452
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:50,311
blanket concept,
which will be a great point

1453
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:55,316
of juxtaposition to add a little bit
more detail, like if it is a front,

1454
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,554
a contact front with active inference,
with social and action and abduction,

1455
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,390
then these are like hot points

1456
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:07,162
or points of contact within the interface
front to really zoom in.

1457
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:07,829
Okay.

1458
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,999
How internal state
being used in these two models

1459
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:15,470
and that's where the active inference
ontology is of immense value

1460
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,372
because even when people

1461
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:20,475
are speaking in different languages
or we have a computer program

1462
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,878
in equation, a poem
and then a scientific paper,

1463
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,549
when we can link and proactively use

1464
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:32,086
or proactively annotate
with the active inference ontology,

1465
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:36,324
we gain the ability to not just say,
Well, we're both pointing out the moon

1466
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:40,094
is your finger, my finger,
or are we pointing at the same finger

1467
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,529
because it's so far away

1468
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,333
and so maybe it's a little bit off
and your your ray is missing the moon.

1469
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,635
From my point of view and so on.

1470
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:53,942
Instead, we can actually get down
and not bleed out on the operating table,

1471
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:58,313
but rather pin down transiently
and find a attractor

1472
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:01,416
that helps us
really go into that intersection,

1473
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:05,853
rather than merely hitting and running
with just points of resonance in.

1474
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,190
Yeah, again,

1475
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:13,228
I'll just summarize that by saying
we can situationally analyze better

1476
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:17,265
because we now actually have a way
of being able

1477
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,801
to hold some, some common

1478
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:22,704
thing together.

1479
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:25,073
So that's all I want to add
to what you just said.

1480
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:29,177
And just add in one onto to
that as well is yeah.

1481
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,478
So but

1482
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:35,850
and where there may be a difference
so you know like that can

1483
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:41,022
this understanding of a lot of the terms
the ontological understanding say

1484
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,926
what often is a problem
is if there's something that's not

1485
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,297
aligned but is just not noticed

1486
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:52,500
was brushed over say okay
this is different.

1487
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:57,272
Okay,
there's a nonsurgical change here. Yes.

1488
01:27:57,338 --> 01:28:00,708
And there's this there's a way for that
to be practically

1489
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,911
like we have with active
inference is attractive a way to do it

1490
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:06,247
because otherwise there's
so many ontological things

1491
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:08,850
floating around in this space
which is its beauty

1492
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,886
that it's it's not cognitively possible

1493
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,390
to find what you need to look at.

1494
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,224
Thank you.

1495
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,894
The next section again
with these two lights

1496
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:24,999
culminating co constructing
no two lights can physically overlap.

1497
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,001
So there must be parallax

1498
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:30,571
induced by these two lights and shadows
and all kinds of effects.

1499
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:34,475
And maybe it's not the same wavelength
and maybe you're walking around.

1500
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,544
Different sides
have different illuminations.

1501
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:38,780
The section is

1502
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,683
on active inference
in the light of abduction.

1503
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:46,354
This is very fascinating section

1504
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,891
because they're going to take that

1505
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:54,362
almost quasi algorithmic

1506
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:59,000
but certainly pre computational framework

1507
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:02,837
being developed in the later 1800s

1508
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:07,408
and, early 1900s and start to

1509
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:10,578
interface and

1510
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:14,816
see how it relates to active inference
so we can

1511
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:18,553
highlight more and we'll look forward
to discussing in further section.

1512
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:23,224
So do pause it if you want to read
all of this or read the paper.

1513
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:25,460
But they're focusing on the late cinema.
Yes, please, Dean.

1514
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:27,762
I was going to say it's mood lighting.

1515
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:32,767
If you actually look down at the bottom
bullet, the lighting is actually trying.

1516
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:33,935
I talked about it.

1517
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:39,874
Maybe, maybe I don't know if he actually
did have the formalism to back that up.

1518
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:43,878
But actually the inference actually does
now talk about the kind

1519
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:48,683
of level of energy that we can now maybe

1520
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:52,286
see within that the to

1521
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:58,092
constraints
that that that that idea of parameter

1522
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,428
ising back to the light script
sort of thing.

1523
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:02,330
Thank you.

1524
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,366
So just a few quotes
that are really fascinating here.

1525
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:08,369
So in science, abduction

1526
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:13,207
can be likened to the logic
of discovery of hypotheses, which,

1527
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:18,346
as we discussed earlier, has a generative
creative element and then a secondary

1528
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:22,517
selective component like Bayesian model
selection, Bayesian model reduction.

1529
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:26,154
And they even add
with a cautionary remark that no fault

1530
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:29,824
or assimilation of Pearson abduction
can occur to Ivy.

1531
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:32,260
That's inference to the best explanation,

1532
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,730
which is one
half of the two stroke engine.

1533
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:39,567
And commonly people will use abduction
to refer

1534
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:42,270
to probabilistic reasoning
from a given set

1535
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,273
like abduction.

1536
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,608
Elsewhere in the writings,
this late later skimmer,

1537
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:52,313
those ones that are after 1903 that,

1538
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,283
according to experts,
have been the least research ones.

1539
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,619
There's beginning with an observation
of surprising

1540
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,856
factor events.

1541
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:05,693
Observation, surprise
and through a conditional major

1542
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:09,530
premise concludes in a cohort
that of mood.

1543
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:13,067
Again, a mood
which Pierce termed the investigations.

1544
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:16,103
It's like it has and right in it.

1545
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,439
And that is that

1546
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,008
something of imperative importance
ought to be done

1547
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,945
pragmatism in action.

1548
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:27,748
Policy selection
initially aroused by curiosity,

1549
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:33,354
uncertainty reduction, entropy that leads
to the formulation of a question

1550
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:37,358
which is semantic,
and there's more discussion

1551
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:39,494
of the investigations, mood
and other moods

1552
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,196
adjusting.

1553
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:46,601
One other quick thing cohorted
or CO constructed from the other paper.

1554
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:51,606
Again, share a common
prefix that we again,

1555
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:55,309
I think we'll maybe be able to tease
some more of that,

1556
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:58,312
the importance of that
in the next two abstracts.

1557
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,349
Awesome.

1558
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:06,487
They're going to continue with
this question of the economy of research.

1559
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:10,791
So they formed three
argumentative course,

1560
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,529
really specified

1561
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,965
areas of contact
with active inference and abduction

1562
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:21,636
that they're suggesting form
an initial trio or triad

1563
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:26,707
that will start to form the allegiance
between active and of inference.

1564
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:30,177
First, the presence of non

1565
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,313
degenerative triadic relations.

1566
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,850
Then the utilization

1567
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,252
of the leading
principles of abduct of reasoning,

1568
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:43,291
the and third,
the subjunctive conditional formulation.

1569
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,827
There are some logical technicalities
thrown around, but

1570
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:50,197
that's what the streams are for

1571
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,133
in point a

1572
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:54,635
which you can pause and read the text of,

1573
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:58,139
they're going to highlight
the Markoff blanket concept

1574
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,175
or rather their realist

1575
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,578
interpretation as Frist in blankets

1576
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:07,114
and argue that the

1577
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:11,686
of blankets again implemented
in a realist Frist and blanket sense

1578
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:16,591
have a markedly Pearson
irreducibly triadic form

1579
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:21,862
focusing on the boundary as mediator
between external internal states

1580
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,900
and therefore the third ness
arising in some meiosis.

1581
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:29,170
There's a lot more to say, but
if either of you want to give one more

1582
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:32,373
point on a,

1583
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:35,643
okay, in B, they're going to continue on

1584
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,413
by talking about some of the guiding
principles of inference

1585
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:44,251
and specifically discuss
abductions role in guiding inference.

1586
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:45,686
What is the

1587
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:48,422
leading principle of active inference
is then

1588
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:53,194
here they're going to describe some
technical details of active inference

1589
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:58,532
in terms of free energy, variational
or expected as bounding surprise,

1590
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:03,871
and then they'll connect that
to some of the primary sources of Peirce

1591
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:08,743
and discussions of bio semiotics,
which have also been connected

1592
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:11,646
in a lot of discussions
that we've had on, representation

1593
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,948
and meaning and so on, and

1594
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,785
it goes even further or deeper.

1595
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:21,789
A field where discussions of sonic ism,

1596
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:27,928
as well as this question of universal
mind, which is for staging in some ways

1597
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,565
the universal cognition, cognitive

1598
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:34,502
dynamics, distributed cognitive systems,

1599
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,039
matter is effort mind by Von Schiller,

1600
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:41,275
and then they're going to argue

1601
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:45,246
first in blankets and their construction
in terms of triadic relationships.

1602
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,582
Pearson
triad sign object interpret aren't

1603
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,086
leads to unexplored
and semantic possibilities,

1604
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,655
bringing together some of

1605
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:58,292
these broader
qualitative threads in semiotic analysis

1606
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:01,896
with potentially dynamical systems
theory,

1607
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,733
quantitative Bayesian methods
and everything else that active inference

1608
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:08,102
brings
along with the toolkits to implement

1609
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:11,072
and see.

1610
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,808
They're also in C going to unpack

1611
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,178
some extremely interesting

1612
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:21,182
though
nuanced logical, constructive elements

1613
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,285
of the semiotic proposition,

1614
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,888
if I could call it that.

1615
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:31,525
We'll go into it
more in further discussions.

1616
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:35,396
But they're going to explore
how different

1617
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:42,203
framings of relationships
among clauses or assertions in warrants.

1618
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:48,476
And all of this
rhetoric relate to realism, abduction

1619
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:52,480
and Peirce's version of realism as

1620
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,282
the possible is what can become actual.

1621
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,253
Yes, there are things that are possible
but cannot become actual.

1622
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:02,857
And then what do we use for
that adjacency or realizable

1623
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:06,160
possible and

1624
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:10,464
where might we want to use it
and what's going to break that symmetry?

1625
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:11,966
Where is pragmatism?

1626
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:15,569
Well, what would be useful to consider
would be the space

1627
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:19,974
of all possible, as that could happen
and none other, and not be surprised

1628
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:23,177
by adjacent possibles
that we didn't consider but did happen.

1629
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,080
And then maybe it's not so bad

1630
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:30,751
to spend a little bit of extra
thought or a few extra computer resources

1631
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:33,654
on considering possibilities
that couldn't happen.

1632
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:38,092
But we wouldn't want to get lost
in the potentially

1633
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:42,062
exponential space of possibilities
that can't happen

1634
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,534
and end up losing our focus and attention
on possibilities that can happen,

1635
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,271
which are what Pierce describes
as real possibilities

1636
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,608
and the pragmatist stance

1637
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:59,580
and mood also closes
the loop with policy selection

1638
01:36:59,847 --> 01:37:03,651
and pragmatism in active inference,
where they say that

1639
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:07,454
the pragmatist meaning of beliefs
in the bean pierce formulation

1640
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:12,092
is that a pond, one that upon
which one is capable of acting.

1641
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:15,229
And there's a lot of resonances there.

1642
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,996
Stephen

1643
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:21,268
I think this also speaks
then to the need to have

1644
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:25,406
we talk about scale,
friendly or levels or, you know,

1645
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:28,909
some sort of structure
that enables this to be present

1646
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:33,414
because you know acts inference
can so go all the way down in the

1647
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:37,518
brought it down to the cellular level
this there's ways of looking at it.

1648
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:42,456
Yeah there's a sense that okay
we're looking at these ideas

1649
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:44,892
of a signifier

1650
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,261
but we know we've active inference.

1651
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:50,698
It's not that it's
believes that we have signals coming in

1652
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:53,200
which get processed and aggregated.

1653
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,570
So there's there's a sort of a scale
at which you have

1654
01:37:56,804 --> 01:38:00,374
the structures that you have the
the morphogenesis maybe

1655
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,410
to get to an a scale to make

1656
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:06,780
the stop sign make sense to be

1657
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:10,517
interpreted

1658
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:14,288
as a as its own signifier.

1659
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:18,259
So I think that may be where there's
this tension going to happen

1660
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:22,196
between the and activists here
and where that can happen.

1661
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:26,567
But the argument that well, I would say
is that certain scales,

1662
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:30,337
certain structures
and maybe certain realist

1663
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,775
ways of things happening,
something like that

1664
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,378
is feasible.

1665
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:39,413
Great. Just Dean.

1666
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:41,415
And then we'll quickly
move through the rest.

1667
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:44,852
Of you ask me real quick here, I think
especially and B

1668
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:48,022
and I know to a lesser extent and C in

1669
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:51,792
the business of how we take Pearson's

1670
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:56,196
Pearson
thinking into the activity science realm

1671
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:58,599
is built on an assumption.

1672
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:03,404
And that is that the key to our
our continuing existence, our continuing

1673
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:05,472
reality

1674
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,609
means that we're accumulating
more experiences

1675
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,445
with the tools in the world,

1676
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:14,548
the rules in the world and the pools.

1677
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:19,086
And by I mean those aggregations
that Steven was just pointing to.

1678
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:20,487
Thank you for bringing that up, Steven,

1679
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:24,959
because that made me want to write
this now, aggregations as densities

1680
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:28,095
tale of two densities materializing.

1681
01:39:29,163 --> 01:39:31,498
So again, I don't know

1682
01:39:31,865 --> 01:39:35,703
that you exclusively say
everything is real

1683
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:38,739
and then all the examples underneath
it are also real,

1684
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:43,610
because even Pearce himself said
that there is an aspect of this reality

1685
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:47,381
which we will never be able to describe

1686
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:49,917
as anything other than non-reality,

1687
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:53,287
even though we're fundamentally using it.

1688
01:39:53,854 --> 01:39:56,256
So how does that how does that

1689
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,493
enable these densities to form?

1690
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:02,262
And I know that sounds
where the heck in gone out there.

1691
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,866
I'm sorry but it's actually something
we have to contemplate.

1692
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:08,435
Thanks.

1693
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:13,240
They're then going to let the script
or at least the syntax

1694
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:17,177
and talk about abduct
even in the light of active inference.

1695
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:22,416
Here is where they kick off with that
acknowledgments of the two stroke engine

1696
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:25,686
with generative abduction
and selective abduction.

1697
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,790
And then they're going to connect that
to some of the ontology

1698
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:34,661
of active inference in terms of
like seeing selective abduction

1699
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:37,531
as a sampling process

1700
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,934
and understanding
where generative abduction fits in.

1701
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:43,103
So continuing on with

1702
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:46,006
seeing abduction
from light of active inference,

1703
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:50,144
which we might even operationalize
as saying like framing

1704
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:55,549
or viewing abduction from the perspective
of the active inference ontology.

1705
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,352
So rather than us self-selecting

1706
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:03,490
as interpretations of active inference,
as some concepts

1707
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:07,327
which we cannot necessarily
speak for a concept,

1708
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:12,166
we can't speak for English,
but we can use English words.

1709
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:16,103
And so analogously
we don't need to necessarily

1710
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:18,205
speak for active inference,

1711
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:22,242
though I'm the last
to say what those should or shouldn't do.

1712
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:25,145
It's possible to.

1713
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:27,281
Use the active inference ontology

1714
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:29,583
and then it's kind of like a two step
checklist.

1715
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:32,119
Was the term in the active inference
ontology

1716
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:35,889
in the core supplement
or entailed sections?

1717
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:39,259
Was it used in a way that was pragmatic,
that made sense

1718
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:42,863
in that situation,
in that multiscale context

1719
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,000
and? That
is actually a two step process to ask

1720
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:52,873
if we're speaking using active inference
rather than if we're speaking for

1721
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:56,643
like an advocate or like a salesperson
for active inference per se.

1722
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:02,216
And they're going to restate the case
in terms of the FIP framework,

1723
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,252
in the sense of and using the terms of.

1724
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:09,256
And they're going to highlight
the relationship of internal states

1725
01:42:10,057 --> 01:42:12,559
to external states
mediated through the blanket.

1726
01:42:13,026 --> 01:42:15,229
And then then go through this syllogism

1727
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:18,165
and they restructure and restate

1728
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:24,605
their qualitative schema
of abducting, of active inference,

1729
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:28,876
and they describe this action
cognition perception loop

1730
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:32,412
where a surprise or any incoming

1731
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:35,983
sensory information is experienced.

1732
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:41,155
And then they take that
not just into the passive or even active

1733
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:46,059
interpretation of it in the context
of a Bayesian generative model,

1734
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:52,599
but rather something that is unfolding
in that mood of the investigate IT.

1735
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:58,539
They do continue on

1736
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,408
and bring in important person

1737
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:04,478
idea of the economy, of research.

1738
01:43:04,478 --> 01:43:06,713
So we'll go over this again, hopefully

1739
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:10,250
with authors.

1740
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,453
It relates to Peirce's Theory of Science

1741
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:16,890
Peirce's original paper in 1970

1742
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:21,428
or 1876 on the economy of research
wrote The doctrine of economy

1743
01:43:21,428 --> 01:43:24,998
in general treats the relationships
between utility and cost,

1744
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:29,369
and specifically
that is going to be related to research

1745
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:32,739
in this socially enacted, pragmatic sense

1746
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:37,678
by asking how given expenditure of money,
time and energy,

1747
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:42,216
what is going to obtain
the most valuable addition to knowledge?

1748
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:45,485
What experiment that my eyes could psyche

1749
01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:47,955
to will have the most information gain?

1750
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,658
What could the researcher carry out

1751
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:55,429
to reduce their uncertainty
the most about the natural system,

1752
01:43:55,963 --> 01:44:00,067
not merely to verify something they know,
not merely to falsify

1753
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:03,670
something that they know
will be falsified, but rather to exist

1754
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:06,173
in this optimal experimentation space.

1755
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:11,211
And then Peirce and later,
the authors are going to naturalize,

1756
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:15,515
contextualize,
bring to the social cognitive area

1757
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:18,885
by asking, well,
how does money, time and energy happen?

1758
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,389
Because that optimal experiment
is in cultured

1759
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:24,925
and it uses energy, it uses reagents.

1760
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:29,096
So perhaps in this way, we could say that
Peirce was one of the first modern

1761
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:32,199
program managers
for a major funding agency.

1762
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:34,301
But no, he wasn't.

1763
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:36,870
And they discussed this
economy of research

1764
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:41,341
a bit more.

1765
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:44,077
They describe in this section how Peirce

1766
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:47,881
promotes several

1767
01:44:48,382 --> 01:44:49,983
values or virtues

1768
01:44:49,983 --> 01:44:53,353
or qualities that characterize

1769
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,223
the economy of scientific hypothesis,
making

1770
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:01,094
in complexity, which is like a de-risking

1771
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:05,532
breath, which speaks to unification

1772
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,702
and caution

1773
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:12,739
as the economic quality
of avoiding diminishing marginal returns

1774
01:45:13,206 --> 01:45:16,510
by skillfully breaking down questions
into a series of small

1775
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:20,113
that can be answered
with reasonable limits of investment.

1776
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:23,517
How many interesting threads
are being brought together?

1777
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:26,486
For example, questions
that are broken down.

1778
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:27,487
Binary? Yes.

1779
01:45:27,487 --> 01:45:31,692
No questions can be connected
to information, theory

1780
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:37,297
and quantum as well.

1781
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:38,198
Here's Dean.

1782
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:40,534
I will let you

1783
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:44,838
speak to fairness.

1784
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:46,273
Well, I'll just read it, to be fair.

1785
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,809
And as we began this paper,
there are no instrumental

1786
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:52,546
misinterpretations of FFP
and its ingredients such as markup.

1787
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:54,481
Like it's.

1788
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:57,184
But this is a footnote in this paper.

1789
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:00,687
But our face, for want of a better word,
of realist credentials of ATP,

1790
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:04,591
has its roots in the pragmatic pragmatist
optimism, or rather

1791
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:09,262
its active militarism, both against
and the alliance between evolutionary

1792
01:46:09,663 --> 01:46:13,967
evolutionarily useful processes
to contribute to maximizing survival.

1793
01:46:13,967 --> 01:46:15,402
If this pragmatist approach

1794
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:18,772
to realism displeases
the elevated taste of one who looks

1795
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:23,076
for some staunch metaphysical criteria,
let a thousand flowers bloom.

1796
01:46:23,076 --> 01:46:26,079
I think what's fascinating
about this is that

1797
01:46:27,647 --> 01:46:30,450
to hold the idea that there is a realism

1798
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:34,855
is that it's a very easily
defendable position to take.

1799
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:38,091
But even in the previous slides,
one of the things that

1800
01:46:38,658 --> 01:46:44,564
that first talked about without saying
them, or at least not in those quotes,

1801
01:46:44,865 --> 01:46:50,737
was that that optimal position
is some some element of exploitation

1802
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:55,509
or economy or simplicity
or or somebody has done this book for me.

1803
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,713
Is that a shortcut and exploration

1804
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:05,085
which tends to take longer,
has more trial and error,

1805
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:08,188
but also doesn't have you constantly

1806
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:12,259
overfitting to a particular level.

1807
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:15,729
So that's the reality.

1808
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:19,633
And again, I wouldn't
I wouldn't push back on the claim

1809
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:23,703
that there is a very real piece
to this playing

1810
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:27,574
play, a minimum of two
going back and forth on this.

1811
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:31,378
So I'm not

1812
01:47:31,378 --> 01:47:34,381
fact fully agreeing with these authors
like I fully agree

1813
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:38,718
with the other authors about
about the idea of a code construction.

1814
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:42,722
So I don't know that you you you are

1815
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,593
you are necessarily confused

1816
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:51,031
if you can say yes and yes and yes again.

1817
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:54,000
Some even.

1818
01:47:54,701 --> 01:47:55,402
Yeah.

1819
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:58,305
So adding to what the in saying there and

1820
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,045
the idea of implementation
or exploitation

1821
01:48:05,045 --> 01:48:07,113
definitely has been alluded to.

1822
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:13,587
And in science, there's experimentation
is sort of the way of gaining knowledge.

1823
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:18,592
But there's the exploration piece
and I would argue that

1824
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:23,063
you can't get exploration

1825
01:48:23,196 --> 01:48:25,832
per say within the kind of

1826
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:30,136
objective domain
there has to be this journey

1827
01:48:30,136 --> 01:48:34,741
into the into the, into the performative
subjects, into subjective liminal,

1828
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:38,545
as Einstein did
with his mind games over these.

1829
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:44,251
And you create these
sort of mental constructs in a way,

1830
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:47,587
some of what's happening
today is a mixture of that

1831
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:53,159
and then that's brought back
and model would experimented or whatever.

1832
01:48:53,293 --> 01:48:57,063
And so I think there's
I mean modeling is interesting because

1833
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,333
it's kind of can

1834
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,670
come on that journey
a little bit as so that's

1835
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:07,007
that's could be something
which experiments can't do.

1836
01:49:08,508 --> 01:49:10,744
Here's a summary of an old joke person

1837
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:14,981
a says a and the referee says,
You're right.

1838
01:49:14,981 --> 01:49:18,118
Person B says B,
the referee says you're right.

1839
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:20,820
And person
C says, Well, A and B can't be right.

1840
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:25,425
And the referee says,
You know, you're right.

1841
01:49:25,425 --> 01:49:27,928
It's a little rapid humor
for those who like that genre.

1842
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:31,665
They then have a conclusion section

1843
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:36,736
and we have many questions and points
to make and a lot of connections

1844
01:49:36,736 --> 01:49:40,240
to bring back
to a lot of the naturalization here,

1845
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:44,144
like the fields and leaven work
and they even take it

1846
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:46,379
to the regenerative
capacities of flatworms.

1847
01:49:46,379 --> 01:49:49,416
So from flatworms to flatmates,

1848
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:52,452
that's where we're going today.

1849
01:49:52,452 --> 01:49:55,288
And then we also saved up
for the Dart one,

1850
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:59,793
some of the juxtaposition
of the mark of blanket concept,

1851
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:04,998
specifically the social
and active components of science,

1852
01:50:04,998 --> 01:50:07,500
which are super important
and Magid has brought on

1853
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,438
to these discussions
previously, is a great point of contact

1854
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:15,241
with the objective paper
and the social and active paper.

1855
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:19,913
Markoff blankets represent
like a very constrained, even technical

1856
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:25,952
contact front that will provide
a lot of discussion in the dot one.

1857
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:29,089
And that is where we close the doors zero

1858
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:32,525
with again so much excellent

1859
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:37,430
groundwork and backpack
packing by Dean and Stephen.

1860
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:41,401
So is there anything else
you'd like to add at this point

1861
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:45,505
or anything arising
that you want to discuss in the one? Yes.

1862
01:50:45,905 --> 01:50:47,807
Dean Then Stephen, if you'd like.

1863
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:51,211
And your fantastic job
we just did in order of magnitude

1864
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:54,881
three from what was typically
a single paper live stream.

1865
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:58,952
Now we still got it in under 2 hours
that you're due to be applauded for that.

1866
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:03,757
And secondly, I just want to ask
maybe as a bit of a tip off for the one.

1867
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:07,360
There's a researcher
by the name of this disparate Nunez

1868
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:10,063
who talks about if you want to be able to

1869
01:51:10,463 --> 01:51:13,133
look at how things are deconstructed,

1870
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:16,202
constructed, you have to look
at both product in process.

1871
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:20,940
An example being, how do I feel the car
and process in product?

1872
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:24,477
What is what is the thing

1873
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:29,783
that's either
a branching point or an actual utensil?

1874
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:34,888
And so if you if you open your mind
up to both that conversion

1875
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:40,293
along that continuum,
it opens up all kinds of possibilities

1876
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:43,630
in terms of bringing things into a place
where they don't

1877
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:47,434
necessarily come into conflict yet
they can integrate and break.

1878
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:51,104
And so maybe that will be after today,

1879
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:54,574
something that people
who are using active inference,

1880
01:51:54,607 --> 01:51:58,411
which in my opinion is both product
and process and process

1881
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:02,215
and product at the same time, it's
the gripper and grip.

1882
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:07,454
Maybe that maybe they will give
some thought over to that.

1883
01:52:07,454 --> 01:52:11,357
It's almost like the pragmatist
sees the fork in the road and uses it

1884
01:52:12,459 --> 01:52:13,126
and maybe

1885
01:52:13,126 --> 01:52:16,863
use the fork by going one way,
and maybe you do pick it up.

1886
01:52:16,863 --> 01:52:20,433
Maybe you use it by completing the table
setting for someone else

1887
01:52:20,433 --> 01:52:21,134
who will dine there.

1888
01:52:21,134 --> 01:52:23,002
And so there's so many ways to use

1889
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:28,408
because use is socially enacted abductor
contextualized, etc.

1890
01:52:28,808 --> 01:52:33,980
And again, at the fork is where
that conversation is happening.

1891
01:52:34,214 --> 01:52:37,150
And at our field site or at base

1892
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:41,087
camp is where we can imagine the forks
and the rows that will come across.

1893
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:41,855
Stephen

1894
01:52:43,156 --> 01:52:45,258
Yeah, next in the dot

1895
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:48,661
one sort of finding a way to, to

1896
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:53,967
bring the authors if whoever's there,
you know, on a bit of a journey,

1897
01:52:53,967 --> 01:52:55,101
maybe down one of the forks,

1898
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:58,438
maybe it goes to the edge of the lake
and we need to get in and get a bit wet.

1899
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:01,741
So how can scientific

1900
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:05,645
abduction or some of the sort of more
scientifically bounded

1901
01:53:06,513 --> 01:53:11,551
models, those substantiated
by experimentation and instrumentation?

1902
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:12,218
Okay.

1903
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:15,421
When when does that get moved away?

1904
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:18,458
Maybe because of participation,
maybe because a transdisciplinary team,

1905
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,928
maybe because of transformational
processes, maybe because of deep

1906
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:25,398
exploration outside of the field

1907
01:53:26,766 --> 01:53:29,502
I wonder, this is something
I might want to think about.

1908
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,905
How can we

1909
01:53:32,205 --> 01:53:34,474
give a

1910
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:37,277
some sort of clear

1911
01:53:37,277 --> 01:53:41,247
journey options, right,
so that they can come a little bit off

1912
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:44,384
without getting stuck
in, you know, in quicksand or

1913
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:47,687
drowning in the deep water. Right.

1914
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:51,124
So we want to sort of navigate,
but I think this this is given

1915
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:54,460
some of those pointers,

1916
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,863
I think where there is sort of

1917
01:53:58,264 --> 01:54:00,600
ways off ramps as well as on ramps.

1918
01:54:00,767 --> 01:54:03,436
So thanks.

1919
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:06,072
Thank you, fellows. Thank you.

1920
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:06,906
Thank you to.

1921
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:08,208
This was huge.

1922
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:10,443
I really, really appreciate all your help

1923
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:12,545
great times.

1924
01:54:12,545 --> 01:54:45,445
See you in the door. One.
