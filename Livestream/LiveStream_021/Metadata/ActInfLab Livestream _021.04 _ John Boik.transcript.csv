"Speaker 1","00;00;10;03","00;00;41;26","Hello and welcome. Welcome to active live we're in livestream number 21.04 on April 27th 2021. And today we are in the fourth of a series of conversations with John Blake so John, it's been really awesome to get to know about you and your ideas and work with you on these giant boards. So as I sort of set things up for a second and share the jam board link with the live chat, go ahead and just re catch us up and then I'll meet you on the first slide in just a minute."
"Speaker 2","00;00;43;13","00;01;08;21","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks. Selma. My name is John Blake. I'm courtesy faculty at Oregon State University, and the series of discussions that we've been having is on the is on a paper. There is a paper that I just published in the journal Sustainability. It's a three part series. The topic is well, the title is Science Driven Societal Transformation in parts one, two and three."
"Speaker 2","00;01;09;26","00;01;37;16","So we've this is our fourth get together here and we're just finishing up our discussion of the last in that series, part three, which is the subtitle design. And we, we covered quite a bit in that in that paper, part three. But now today we're going to focus on just one aspect of that, which is the leader framework Local Economic Direct Democracy Association framework."
"Speaker 2","00;01;38;00","00;02;16;26","This is a I'm talking a prototype of design for a new societal systems and as a reminder to listeners, we're talking about the de novo design of new systems, specifically using a club model. So the societal systems for a club, the club is a is a small community somewhere, something larger than, say, a thousand volunteer participants. That's how the in the series itself proposes an R&D program and that's the strategy for change."
"Speaker 2","00;02;16;26","00;02;56;11","And the R&D program is new systems are tested at the club level, the community level, in cooperation with the global scientific community is working on the technical aspects. And then field trials occur at the club level. And if the if the new systems deliver as promised and they promise substantial improvement in social and environmental quality, economic security and various things like that, then the idea is that the club model would grow and spread and spread to new locations and new testing and new trials and eventually would spread spread near on a near global basis."
"Speaker 2","00;02;58;01","00;03;00;06","So are we on slide one yet?"
"Speaker 1","00;03;01;02","00;03;02;04","We're ready on slide one."
"Speaker 2","00;03;03;13","00;03;12;10","OK, so that's our that's just our list of discussions we've had. You can check out the links there for the previous YouTube videos."
"Speaker 2","00;03;14;22","00;03;48;00","And Slide two if you would go there. Yep. Is that just where or just where to go for more information? So the my website for this project is called Principal Wood Societies Project Dot org, and it lists the gives links to the series get some background information actually has a on there is a live or interactive model of the leader framework so so part of what will be a big part of what we'll be talking about today is actually on the website."
"Speaker 2","00;03;48;00","00;04;17;28","If you want to run the model yourself so there you go there for more information. And then third slide yeah. So today's topic again is the leader framework, local economic director accuracy association. These are ideas from my 24 2014 book called Economic Direct Democracy. That book is available for free on the website or if you want to spend money you can go to Amazon to buy it."
"Speaker 2","00;04;17;28","00;04;52;00","There and along with that book I published a simulation model of later framework or at least parts of the leader framework and that is in the Internet Film Term Journal of Community Currency Research. So links are there for that. And again, all of these links are available on the Principal Science Project website OK, so now why would I want to discuss this slide four?"
"Speaker 2","00;04;52;12","00;05;29;10","Why would I want to discuss the leader framework in this three part series? A few reasons. One is that the leader, the design of the leader framework, maybe I should say that the leader framework is intended as an integrated societal systems architecture or what I've been calling it, cognitive architecture. The idea behind this whole series, behind this work is that a society large or small is a cognitive organism and its societal systems, which, for example, the economic systems legal systems, governance systems, et cetera, act as a cognitive architecture."
"Speaker 2","00;05;29;13","00;06;07;09","So so when discussing the idea of societal transformation, my focus here is on creating new societal systems versus societal systems deliver design. So that they function as cognitive systems, they facilitate vital cognition and this is the fitness based, evidence based R&D project. So the idea would be that you could assess how well some one how well one design is doing over another design."
"Speaker 2","00;06;07;24","00;06;35;06","And eventually communities could choose designs that function very well and are fit for purpose. All right. So the leader framework embodies the cognitive viewpoint. It also was designed to be implemented via the cloud model, which I talk about in part two of the series. That's the strategy for change. Number three is here. The reason is that it involves integrated systems."
"Speaker 2","00;06;35;13","00;07;05;15","So there's in the in the series, I talk about six overarching systems, legal governance, et cetera. And the legal framework integrates most of them. And finally, there's a published simulation model available, at least for the economics, some economic aspects of the framework. And at the time, and I think that still might be true. This is the first semi realistic simulation of a de novo system, a de novo economic system."
"Speaker 2","00;07;06;05","00;07;38;11","But I'm aware, aware of number five. All right. So I'll get into the summit. We'll talk a lot about the simulation today and a little bit about the, you know, the structure of the leader. But let me just offer a few warm up thoughts the leader economy is not like what we face in normal economy. That's it's it's fundamentally different."
"Speaker 2","00;07;39;07","00;08;10;14","And in particular, it is a democratic it is a cognitive architecture, as I've said, and it is deeply democratic and transparent. So in the in the lead economy money, there is money in both the national currency and in America, the dollar and a local digital currency that I call the token. So those two current forces are used as a voting tool in a highly transparent, fair and deeply democratic process."
"Speaker 2","00;08;11;06","00;08;35;22","And as we talked about last time, money is already used as a voting tool in our world. It's just that it is a non transparent, non democratic voting tool for the most part. Some people have billions of votes in the economic system and then other people have just, you know, a small number of votes. So the legal framework makes that voting function explicit and fair."
"Speaker 2","00;08;35;22","00;09;11;27","And democratic. The this emphasis of the simulation we'll be talking about in a moment is on the economic system. But as I mentioned, the leader framework encompasses is know all or almost all six overarching systems. I know this this simulation is intended as a first step, and it is in Spain. It could be made more sophisticated. And this so this first one simply looks at the economic aspects, aspects, because that was the simplest to do for me."
"Speaker 2","00;09;12;05","00;09;37;14","But so money is used as a voting tool and it's and voting occurs in two arenas. It occurs in local markets. So I buy some product from a from a local store, for example, local business. And it also occurs and in the financial system, what I call the crowd based financial system, and we'll talk a lot about that."
"Speaker 2","00;09;37;14","00;10;09;11","But essentially individuals contribute a certain amount of their income to the broad based financial system. And then once their money is in the crowd based financial system, the CDF has, then they have they get to choose how that money is used. So in a sense, they get to vote for they get and offer their votes for how the community is what the community wants, what the community wants to fund, what kind of jobs the community wants to fund and so on."
"Speaker 2","00;10;12;20","00;10;33;03","So if you had a if you had an economic system in which money was used as a voting tool, well, it would be a fairly undemocratic unless incomes and wealth were somehow equal. So over time, the effect of the leader is to equalize income."
"Speaker 2","00;10;35;07","00;11;06;28","And I'll show you the results of that in a minute. The latest simulation runs 28 years and as you'll see at the end of that 20 year period, everyone who has joined the club is enjoying an equal level of equal and higher level of income wealth. And lastly, the leader framework is designed to focus on motivations. But is there any new system developed in this R&D program?"
"Speaker 2","00;11;07;23","00;11;37;01","The goal is to have that system be fit for purpose. And as we've talked about the purpose of arts of society, the purpose of societal cognition, of the purpose of actions to the implicit purpose of societal systems is to facilitate societal cognition and to and thus to ensure that the organism the society maintains, achieves and maintains a high degree of vitality."
"Speaker 2","00;11;38;14","00;12;06;27","So the any new systems developed should be fit for purpose. And, and if they're fit for purpose, almost by definition, they will facilitate cooperation because cooperation and communication is a part of cognition. So the leader framework and what rewards barriers to cooperation and with the idea of that, that it makes cooperation so easy, that cooperation becomes the default behavior."
"Speaker 2","00;12;07;21","00;12;42;29","And it also focuses on motivations it does not reward people for non-cooperative behavior, for example. And that is in contrast, to our existing systems, which which I call native systems in the series. But I in Native Systems, I and for paying my worker very well take advantage of the workers I get, the society would reward me greatly for that."
"Speaker 2","00;12;42;29","00;13;07;08","And that doesn't occur in the leader framework. Partly because income and wealth are equalized over time. Thus, the the part the motivation to participate in the economic system of a leader we call it we can also call it a club model is not personal gain, but community wellbeing, wellbeing of the larger organism digitization."
"Speaker 1","00;13;07;09","00;13;18;17","Slide six there are these are the members of a club. Are you thinking spatially co-located? Are they remotely located?"
"Speaker 2","00;13;19;27","00;13;54;27","Yes, locally in space and it is it is perhaps possible to have a club that is distributed over over space. But I didn't start that way. I mean, that maybe could be something that's added later, but I'm focusing now. It's the easiest thing for me has been the easiest thing to me for me to focus on the local market, local area, but there's reasons why that the local there are is important because many decisions are local, like who will pick up my garbage and where will that garbage go?"
"Speaker 2","00;13;54;27","00;14;26;21","Is a local decision. You think many of the decisions, many of the our quality of life is largely a local issue. For example, are my economic security is largely a local issue. And obviously being a speck close in space allows a greater opportunity for community building and gathering and seeing face to face and community communicating face to face and getting to know each other and building a deep sense of friendship and community that way."
"Speaker 2","00;14;28;01","00;14;49;18","But yes, in the future, communities might be extended in some way. And as a matter of fact, of the idea with the leader framework or the idea with the club model is that that the initial focus would be on developing the tools and systems for clubs for the project, and then that would land systems for club and parks."
"Speaker 2","00;14;51;08","00;15;00;15","So that would be by definition non-local, you know, non-local engagement because clubs might be in different areas of the world."
"Speaker 2","00;15;03;21","00;15;35;28","OK, so but right. Yep. So there's in the bottom left of that slide over in the bottom left in that slide, I'm listing the six overarching system. Those that I talk about in the, in the series and you can you will see that all but so the leader. So I would imagine that if this were developed further that health would also be included."
"Speaker 2","00;15;35;28","00;16;00;08","But I'm just having included it. Yeah. So very briefly, the site lists of seven integrated components, the first three I'm calling, I call them collectively the token exchange system. Again, the token is the local currency and it and it travels in parallel with the national currency with the dollar locally there's a token monetary system that creates and destroys tokens."
"Speaker 2","00;16;00;11","00;16;34;20","There is the crowd based financial system, which I mentioned already that that to declare that CVS handles both the national currency and the token it it issues to local businesses and nonprofits. It issues donations, interest free loans and subsidies. And these are all transparent, transparent through democratic decision making. And it also has a nurture arm that people contribute to and members contribute to and that nurture and provides income for not what I call not in workforce numbers."
"Speaker 2","00;16;34;24","00;17;04;05","So when I say that the leader achieves income equality over time, I mean, for every single member, so you can think of it as every member family or however you want to think of it. But regardless of whether that person is in the workforce, not in the workforce, ill not ill employed, not employed in that sense, it's it's a little bit like a universal income only."
"Speaker 2","00;17;04;05","00;17;29;02","It's very high income, same income that everyone is enjoying. I'll show you that in just a minute. And then number three in the entity as a token exchange system is the market system. So these would be local. Most local markets that are that are members and part of some of the new businesses that are developed by the leader would are called principal businesses, principal businesses."
"Speaker 2","00;17;29;13","00;18;01;18","And that's the very special business model unique to the leader, kind of like a nonprofit, kind of like a hybrid between a nonprofit and a regular for profit business. But number four, there's a property rights system that goes along with this. For example, a club leader would have an IP pool for intellectual property. And the and the club could also manage other properties, could manage real estate properties for example, or any kind of property."
"Speaker 2","00;18;02;27","00;18;32;09","So it would be democratic decision making for property management. Also, there'd be some restrictions on the sale of principal businesses kind of similar to non-profits, and that would be high transparency throughout. So the community would know if the community is using money as a voting tool, community would need to know where their what's happening with their votes, what's what was the, you know, what are the choices that the community is making with with money."
"Speaker 2","00;18;32;25","00;18;37;01","And so the flow of money would be highly transparent compared to today."
"Speaker 2","00;18;39;13","00;19;21;24","Number five is an information and incentive system. This would include, for example, education programs, reputation system, the fitness indexes that we've talked about which allow the community to understand itself how it's doing, what's going to happen next, how, how, what is the quality of the design that we're using? Could we improve our design? And along with fitness index, the last one, there's computer and other kinds of forecasting and assessment methods that would help a community to understand what are the trends and how is the system working and how are we doing number six of the collaborative governance system, and that has three branches, administrative, legislative and judicial."
"Speaker 2","00;19;21;24","00;19;53;22","So that then covers the legal system. And finally, number seven is purpose. And we've already talked in each of these discussions. We've talked about the the importance of purpose and how purpose purpose follows worldview and an end to end design and metrics follow from purpose OK, so next."
"Speaker 1","00;19;55;23","00;19;56;02","OK."
"Speaker 2","00;19;57;21","00;20;30;18","All right. So now we'll we'll spend most of the rest in this discussion on the simulation model. Because I think that that'll be most that will make the description of the different quotes clear. And again, the, the, this is this is a first simulation and it's it's intended to introduce the, the lead a framework and also this to describe some general concepts of token dollar use dollar as the national currency, if you don't mind token dollar flow."
"Speaker 2","00;20;31;03","00;21;07;17","And and it's the third aim of this and on the left paragraph there is to demonstrate at least, you know, conceptual claim that income equality can be achieved, that there's some parameter zation of this model of it. And so you can choose parameters such that this goal of income equality can be achieved at the end of the simulation, that the simulation lasts for about 228 years, I believe."
"Speaker 2","00;21;08;23","00;21;34;07","So this is not a, this is not, you know, this is the, the concept behind the leader is that it bootstraps, it's success, it starts small, it grows from there. It injects like in the very first year, maybe just a few members will will join and the leader injects a small amount of tokens as the as the local currency into the economy."
"Speaker 2","00;21;34;22","00;22;09;26","And makes some very small changes. And then the next year, there's another few people join it, make some bigger changes. The next year makes another few people join and makes bigger changes still. And the the growth of the leader occurs exponentially fast. So I would I'd like to say that that the functions of the leader, how it how it works, how it achieves its aims, how it achieves income equality, for example, this would all be worked out far in advance before any real trial ever occurred."
"Speaker 2","00;22;09;26","00;22;40;21","So what would actually happen is there would be, say, you know, who knows, hundreds or more of simulations or papers or at least, let's say a large number of simulation papers on a variety of topics would be finished before any community was ever asked to participate in this. So once that body of knowledge is developed, then perhaps the the the program would say, OK, what is there are there any communities in the world that would be interested in participating in a field trial?"
"Speaker 2","00;22;41;12","00;23;07;19","And if you did participate here's the list of benefits that you might expect over, say, a two year field trial. Income levels will increase. This is what's going to happen this is this is how participation will increase. This is, you know, this the trajectory would be laid out through a variety of simulations. So everyone should know what they're getting involved in, what they expect from this."
"Speaker 2","00;23;07;19","00;23;42;20","And and there should be no surprises from the field trials now, it doesn't mean that the community has no choice in their behaviors and what they do with the system. The community drives the system, but the system is designed such to achieve its purpose, right fit for purpose and. All right. So on the left there, I just want to emphasize this, that this simulation conveys broad, low level, low resolution design and intentions for an actual token exchange system."
"Speaker 2","00;23;42;20","00;24;20;02","So I'm not predicting that a token exchange system would work like this. This is rather a illustration of the concept of the token exchange system in the leader framework. And obviously, this simulation can and hopefully will be followed by a large number of other simulations that are progressively more sophisticated. This is a but in many respects a fairly simple simulation and there is tremendous room to expand it and improve it but it's still useful."
"Speaker 2","00;24;20;13","00;25;07;25","And in particular, that's because I made the simulations stock flow consistent, which means that no no money is come out of thin air. It's all, all, you know, if money leaves one agent and then another agent receives it. So all the flows of money are accounted for. And just that alone allows one to say that, OK, logically, you know, logic, mathematically, this all adds up and I would lastly, I would say that this is a what I call a semi realistic simulation that is income level, starting income levels resemble real income levels, tax levels, tax rates resemble real tax rates and thus the initial conditions are some silly, realistic."
"Speaker 2","00;25;08;25","00;25;43;18","But but again, the simulation is very simple. So I start with a semi realistic initial setting and then certain things don't change over the years, which just sort of the only thing that actually changes is just what is pertains to the leader itself. The members themselves. So if you don't join in this in the simulation, if you don't join the leader over a period of years, then your income stays just what it was and then nothing really changes just for you keep the same job and keep the same family and things just move ahead all right."
"Speaker 2","00;25;44;18","00;25;45;25","Yeah, please."
"Speaker 1","00;25;46;20","00;25;59;03","OK, you can address it now or later, but what is the relationship between your simulation and game theory and what is the relationship between your simulation and active inference now?"
"Speaker 2","00;25;59;20","00;26;36;09","OK, OK, so in a this is the agent based model, so that means you know, between the lines, that means that there are individual agents that make decisions of what they want to do, and that determines how the the history of the simulation goes in a highly sophisticated agent based models. The agents themselves might be very complex and they might make decisions about complex situations."
"Speaker 2","00;26;36;28","00;27;08;08","And since this is a just a simple introductory model, the agents are relatively simple like, for example, a family, and they make fairly simple decisions. And the main decision them make in this simulation is whether or not to become members in any given year. Does a family want to become a member? Secondly, they'll make a decision on how they what they choose a wage option which is constructed."
"Speaker 2","00;27;08;08","00;27;39;27","I'll talk about it. So there's not very many decisions that the individual to make here. So it is like a game theory, but it's a very simple game. And later simulations could be made much more sophisticated. And in relation to active inference, I wish I might say that I created these in the book and the simulation model long before I was aware or active inference was so what the book, neither the book nor the simulation model mentions the cognitive aspects."
"Speaker 2","00;27;40;09","00;28;33;26","And that came a little bit later in my in my development and as the project developed in my mind. But but one could easily imagine how active and what inference would fit into this. For example, you know, as I said, a community is considered to be a organism. It's understood as an organism, a cognitive organism. So just like every organism, it has to fulfill its intrinsic purpose, which is to maintain and achieve vital it and it and it in the active inference scheme, it, it assess it, it receives information from its world through it sends this, it updates its models, it chooses actions that changes the world, and then it receives new sensations based on"
"Speaker 2","00;28;33;26","00;29;00;14","the changed world and perhaps updates its model further or chooses a different set of actions or continues with the same action. But, but that's how active inference works for an organism. But that's how active inference would work for a community to the community senses information. It decides it learns what it can learn from the current sensations. It makes decisions about what it will do next in a variety of ways."
"Speaker 2","00;29;00;23","00;29;23;23","What will it do with its solid waste? Where how will it generate energy? What will it fund next? What what businesses will it fund? What nonprofits will would fund? What is it? What is its targets? Does it adjust its targets? So these are all decisions that are that the organism of a community would make as it tries to achieve and maintain in vitality."
"Speaker 2","00;29;24;12","00;29;56;25","And fortunately, since this is a fitness based, evidence based program, the community would know at every moment how it's doing, what it's what its indexes are. It's, you know, its indexes for vitality, for example, or it's or it's indexes for uncertainty about the future so as it tries as the community tries to reduce uncertainty about its essential variables, then it would have an immediate feed back as far as the scores about how it's doing and those scores."
"Speaker 2","00;29;56;25","00;30;37;28","And that information could help it then to update its models or and choose the same or different actions. And so that's the that's how active inference might fit in in the community as a whole. But you could imagine that in these you could focus in on any individual part of this thing, just the principal business. And the principal business is the principal business could also be thinking about its cognition in terms of active inference, if true gathers information and then makes the makes adjustments and learns and chooses actions and then another example is the crowd based financial system itself."
"Speaker 2","00;30;37;29","00;30;48;07","This is a decision making organization and structure, and that whole structure could be modeled using ideas from active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;30;50;17","00;31;17;09","Well, it's interesting how you develop the idea and applied basically the evolution of computational modeling to it. And that helped a few things maybe come out into relief. Like there's that multi scale aspect. And then also the fact that you're pursuing not the maximum GDP, you know, not the the total divided by the number of people which you're maybe going to get a higher average with one billionaire and everyone else at zero."
"Speaker 1","00;31;17;16","00;31;30;20","But that's not the pursuit it's actually a uncertainty minimizing trajectory policy sequence that's starting to sound a lot like active inference. So it's kind of cool how it dovetail together right."
"Speaker 2","00;31;30;21","00;31;50;20","Right. This is these are these are you know, these are probabilistic. You can say the community is developing a probabilistic model of what will happen next, what will happen to me. And and that fits in very well with the active inference scheme. Individuals in the community are developing a generative model of of how I see the world and what will happen next."
"Speaker 2","00;31;51;03","00;32;19;25","And as a matter of fact, in a sense, the that sense is so important since anticipation is so important in cognition. In the individuals in the community, individual organizations such as businesses and the community as a whole would be developing anticipatory models, whether those are formal models and, you know, in computers or whether they're informal models in their in their minds about how how I see the world and how I see what will happen next if A, B and C happens."
"Speaker 2","00;32;20;10","00;33;08;15","So all of that information, that full anticipatory capacity of individuals and organizations and the communities as a whole can be taken or taken into account in the leader can be used in the leader for for its own good all right. Amber Slide eight. Yep. There. OK, all right. So this this image on the right really captures much of the much of the simulation and much of the idea of the leader as far as the token exchange system goes and and before I describe it, I just want to emphasize once again that the token exchange system is just one part of the leader."
"Speaker 2","00;33;09;07","00;33;57;16","And there's other parts that are not up, not in the simulation model, for example, simple. The governance governance system is not in the simulation. So this just flows of currency. And this figure one on the right describes how that works to to simplify this a little bit and let's just look at the arrows and blue and the arrows and blue are both tokens and dollars that float together and we can start and organizations this these are the agents of the model organized the five agents, organizations, persons, CDF, finance, rest of counties which is the rest of the world and government which is local government just looking at the blue lines, we see there's kind of"
"Speaker 2","00;33;57;16","00;34;36;28","a circle being made between organizations person, CPA, CBS and then again two organizations. And that's essentially how how how how things flow organizations persons are employed in organizations and organizations pay wages to persons. Persons spend money back into organizations when they buy goods and services persons support the CBC with contributions and the CBF FRC supports persons in particular, not in workforce persons with what I call nurture support the KBIA first."
"Speaker 2","00;34;37;26","00;35;11;12","So also provides loans, subsidies and donations to organizations, and the organizations pay back the loan principle. I might add that the concept of loans here is, is the token itself is designed to be a noninflationary currency and loans are offered interest free. And so what you don't see here in this circle I just described, what you don't see is investment for profit."
"Speaker 2","00;35;11;20","00;35;41;07","That does not occur in the system especially with relation to principal of businesses. That does occur and obviously doesn't occur with nonprofits because nonprofits are by definition not for profit so. So if I'm a person, I receive wages from my employer or maybe I'm self-employed, I spot things to the other persons and I have to contribute a certain fraction of my income to CBS."
"Speaker 2","00;35;42;02","00;36;12;25","And once it's in the CBS I can organizations, organizations will apply to the CDF s for loans or subsidies or domain issues and I along with my fellow colleagues in the CBC, I have a pool, I have an account there and I can decide I like I like that idea that this new business wants to do. They're going to make a new light bulb or they're going to make a and this is funding for a small organic farm or whatever the situation might be."
"Speaker 2","00;36;13;16","00;36;17;19","I might like what they're doing and I might see value in it for the community."
"Speaker 2","00;36;19;25","00;36;46;20","Again, this is the investments are not related to profit. So I'm not I'm not thinking the way I would think in today's world, in the native economy, if I have money in the native economy, I'm thinking, where can I put my money? That will return to me the greatest gain, personal, personal gain in finances in this system. I'm asking since since personal profit is not part of the picture."
"Speaker 2","00;36;47;06","00;37;29;29","I'm asking where can I put my money that will receive the greatest gain in terms of fitness scores and community well-being and quality of life for myself and my children. So those are the kinds of topics that become pertinent then when when the personal profit motive is taken up. So and so again, in relation to the native economy, the need of the government the say, the US government also makes subsidies to various businesses but here all these choices are deeply democratic."
"Speaker 2","00;37;30;03","00;38;15;03","You know, given that incomes are more or less equal, everyone has more or less the same amount of money in the same amount of currency. So everyone has is essentially equal say in which which businesses get funded, which businesses, whether they get subsidies or whether they get donations, or whether they get loans. And the reason for subsidies rather than loans and donations might be that well, that for one thing, you have to pay back a loan so if you if a community wanted to support, say, a bakery and they thought that this bakery is really great, they don't they're not making a lot of money."
"Speaker 2","00;38;15;03","00;38;35;24","So they're not going to be able to really pay back loans very well. But they're the maybe even they're operating at a loss. But there's just such a great community resource. And we just love this little bakery so much that we would like to give this bakery a subsidy so that it can continue to operate, even though it's losing money every year."
"Speaker 2","00;38;36;05","00;38;54;25","That would be one example of a subsidy. Or there might be we want to subsidize a hospital or we want to slice any any operation that perhaps is not actually making money and couldn't pay back a loan. On the other hand, maybe a business is doing well and we would be willing to support it, but we want to give it a loan instead of subsidy."
"Speaker 2","00;38;55;13","00;38;59;28","Donations really apply more to nonprofits and subsidies really apply more to businesses."
"Speaker 1","00;39;00;27","00;39;02;14","Don't give a thought on that. All right."
"Speaker 2","00;39;03;27","00;39;04;13","Yeah, yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;39;05;02","00;39;30;14","It's like if a person who's granting money has $10,000 and they're deciding whether they want to be the one who gets to decide where the 10,000 go or whether they're going to give it to the cafe, who's going to spend it potentially at other local businesses and allocate it a different way. And the employees are already taken care of, and it's going to contribute to a public good, especially a locally defined one."
"Speaker 1","00;39;30;23","00;39;35;24","And so it's like yeah, I let them spend my $10,000 that I was just going to give away anyway."
"Speaker 2","00;39;37;03","00;40;03;02","Right, right, right. Yeah. So so that raises a really good point that I wanted to make is that what's really happening here, even though it's currency that circulate and what's really happening here is just it's just a way to ensure that everyone gets the same amount of votes in this economic arena. And what people are voting for is not so much money."
"Speaker 2","00;40;03;02","00;40;24;09","If money isn't the resource that this has, especially in a mature leader, the money is circulating the as whole as opposed to later. So it's so it's not really a shortage of money, like how will we get the money for this or where will the money come from? It's not that it's using money as a voting tool to allocate other resources."
"Speaker 2","00;40;24;17","00;40;55;25","Like if I give a if I support a bakery, say, with with a loan or a subsidy today, what I'm saying is I'm I'm voting for human resources of the community to be spent you know, in this bakery, I want this bakery to employ these people and I want the bakery to provide this service to the community. So I'm voting for the service and the allocation of resources that are embodied in this bakery."
"Speaker 2","00;40;56;05","00;41;16;11","Or it could be a hospital or could be could be anything but that's what we're really voting for, is how we spend our time. What do we what do the humans in this what are the members there in their life and their 24 hours a day and seven days a week or whatever in their year, how do they spend their time?"
"Speaker 2","00;41;16;11","00;41;50;08","How do we want to spend our own time? What jobs do we want to work in as a community? How do we want to spend our time? Do we want to be employed by nonprofits? Do we want to be employed by regular businesses? Do we want to be employed by principle businesses? This is the the evolution of this economy is that is the decision making process of a community to decide how it wants to spend its time and where it wants to put its focus and how it how what kind of conditions it wants to operate in all right."
"Speaker 2","00;41;51;12","00;42;18;17","So that's a little bit of introduction to the flow of bookings and dollars together and the maybe I will say one more thing before we get off this is that suppose that and this might be obvious from things I've already said, but I just want to emphasize it. But suppose that me suppose that me and an a group of people in the city of ours decide like, hey, it would be really cool to have a bicycle manufacturer in our town."
"Speaker 2","00;42;19;01","00;42;41;14","So, so together, you know, the 12 of us or the 15 of us or 100 of us decide like, yeah, let's support this bicycle business now every year it's natural that not all businesses are going to make it, you know, some are going to fail and that's natural and good. A community would want to take some choice, some chances, and fund some things that maybe even, you know, a reasonable chance it will fail."
"Speaker 2","00;42;41;14","00;43;09;01","But if it doesn't fail would be great. So so we fund the bicycle business and it fails after a few years. OK, fine. The same money is still circulated in the community. Nothing's really changed now with what has changed, however, is the allocation of human resources that were allocated to the bicycle business now can be allocated someplace else because the bicycle business doesn't exist."
"Speaker 2","00;43;09;19","00;43;36;19","And in the meantime, those employees might become than not in workforce members that maybe don't have a job for a short period so they go from the unemployed category in the person's working persons box to the unemployed and not in workforce box and find that, you know, their income doesn't really change. So they were, you know, they're not out in the street and neither is the business owner, the guy who did the whole thing."
"Speaker 2","00;43;36;19","00;43;58;02","He's not out in the street. He's his income hasn't really changed too much, especially if he's a principal business. So he's fine. The employees are fine. Everybody's taking care of the community took a chance. They said, hey, this would be a good experiment. Let's have a bicycle shop. It didn't work out. But now we'll just we'll get those responses to something else."
"Speaker 2","00;43;58;04","00;44;30;20","Some of the decision so, you know, funny, when I tried to explain this to people, the and I'm using terms money and currency, it's really it's difficult for some folks to get past their interpretation, the common interpretation of what money and investment and currency means. And this is, as I said earlier, this is a leader economy, but it's not like any kind of economy that we're we we think of."
"Speaker 2","00;44;31;14","00;44;41;20","This is really just a decision. This is a cognitive system. In short, this is the description of a cognitive system that a certain flow of that is uses what I call currency."
"Speaker 1","00;44;43;04","00;45;06;07","If I can make a point on that, John, it's like if you use the metaphor of money, a lot of times people debate characteristics like fungibility or store of value or transfer value. But if we think organizationally and we think about, let's say, blood flow or neural information or hormonal signaling, like the goal of the muscle cell is not to accumulate insulin."
"Speaker 1","00;45;06;17","00;45;22;10","It's to use it as a cue, right. To know when to change and so if you think about information flow, blood flow, no cell needs to hang on to the red blood cells and capture things around it because it's part of a bigger plan. So I think that that's a really nice attribute you captured."
"Speaker 2","00;45;23;13","00;45;46;06","Yeah, excellent analogy. And that's very much what the leader is like. It's kind of like a body, kind of like an organism that requires the different cells in that organism to receive blood and food and information and other things like that. So and also on that point, when I say money is used as a voting tool, even more broadly, it's used as an information tool."
"Speaker 2","00;45;46;06","00;46;21;19","So the community is exchanging information when they exchange money still on Slide eight, I've explained now the blue lines, the token and dollar flows, but I haven't explained the green lines. So this the new club in this model, as in there's an old models for new clubs. The community remains part of the larger world. It's there's no the club is not segregated from the rest of the world apart apart from the rest of the world."
"Speaker 2","00;46;21;21","00;46;43;24","It is engaging in all the normal stuff. It's paying taxes to a government. It's purchasing products from member member organizations but also from member organizations. Amazon.com or whoever. So, you know, it's it's participating in the normal way. And this leader framework or the club framework is another layer of organization on top of the normal world."
"Speaker 2","00;46;45;28","00;47;15;09","So these green lines are showing how those dollars are flowing. And again, this is a simplification of the real world, but it gives the idea of still so persons are paying the dollars in taxes, paying the taxes in dollars, I should say. And the government is also giving some income support to unemployed persons. But also happens the government is giving dollars in the form of grants and subsidies and contracts to local organizations and local organizations."
"Speaker 2","00;47;16;11","00;47;48;09","And I created this as a kind of a simplification. But local organizations are exchanging goods and services with the rest of the world. So dollars leave the community when the local organization, for example, purchases supplies from some far distant business and at the same time organizations outside of the club, outside of the county are purchasing things from the member organizations to so, uh, yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;47;48;09","00;48;12;15","So that's, that's a simplified version of how dollars are flowing and obviously now we got a problem because as you know, we have our first challenge. Maybe you could say one challenge is to somehow design the system. So to reach the aim in number three there, that income is becomes more equal over time. But now we have the problem."
"Speaker 2","00;48;12;22","00;48;43;27","We to created this this local currency, the token, and we have to pay taxes on the income to the government and we can't pay taxes and tokens the government's not going to take it. So we got a media challenge of like how do we make this thing work so that every individual has enough dollars to pay? It's the taxes that needs to pay and organizations have enough dollars so they can purchase goods outside the county in dollars."
"Speaker 2","00;48;44;13","00;49;13;02","And yet and yet the whole thing can grow and and then reach the desired ends. So how does that happen? Another question, design question is how do you make this thing good enough that anyone wants to join? Like I know John drawn this picture here of you know, conceptually how it works. But if I if I don't receive anything materially from joining, why would I join now?"
"Speaker 2","00;49;13;03","00;49;34;20","There in actuality, there might be lots of soft reasons to join. I might feel like I'm more part of the community or I might feel like my voice is heard more or it might feel that, you know, by joining, we're able to make better decisions together about things. But in this simulation, I wanted something a little more substantial than that."
"Speaker 2","00;49;35;10","00;50;10;06","So so in the simulation I met, I made the rule that a person will draw in a family will join this if it increases their income and they won't join in if their income doesn't go up so that's that that becomes the challenge, then how do you inject enough tokens and get a good enough circulation of tokens and dollars in the end, this membership such that my income goes up from joining, where at least most people's income, everyone that joins their income goes up."
"Speaker 2","00;50;10;17","00;50;37;12","And how then how many people have to join to make this thing work like 2% of the population in 30 years or 30% of the public relation or 90% of the population, like what does it take? So these are all the questions that we're going to dove into next but the first a few assumptions just explain a little bit how this whole thing works."
"Speaker 2","00;50;38;09","00;51;01;09","The not in workforce population is static. I think it's whatever it is. 36% or something. Like that, you know, there's just a big as in the normal world, a big chunk of people don't participate in the workforce. They're either they're disabled or they're stay at home. They just stay home and don't work or whatever reason I chose the 7%."
"Speaker 2","00;51;01;28","00;51;07;20","Unless you think it's I think the unemployment rate starts at about 7%, something like that."
"Speaker 2","00;51;09;24","00;51;31;27","Every one in the county is adults and grouped into two person families just for simplicity. So household income and family are synonymous. The purchasing power of the token is taken to be equal to the dollar. So when you hear token, think value of about a dollar and structural unemployment is 1%. So, you know, you can't get much below that."
"Speaker 2","00;51;32;06","00;51;43;22","It no matter what you do and all employed persons work full time. You know, just a few assumptions to make the simulation simple. And again later, some simulations could be more complicated."
"Speaker 1","00;51;44;20","00;51;45;23","All right. Give a thought there, John."
"Speaker 2","00;51;47;12","00;51;47;20","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;51;48;25","00;52;10;00","There's almost two extremes for the token. One is actually something that was tried in my little town of Davis California with the Davis dollar, which was a one to 1 USD. It was a stable coin before there were stable coins. And so then they pegged the local currency. It didn't end up continuing. It's not active to this day, but it was a pegged coin."
"Speaker 1","00;52;10;10","00;52;29;16","And then the other alternative would be like a token that essentially people could they could make it nifty out of it or they could go full crypto and they could inflated and speculate on it, do all sorts of leveraging if it was really being traded on the open market. So there's kind of a continuum between a total protected in-group currency."
"Speaker 1","00;52;29;25","00;52;41;22","Something was pegged to a national currency, all these other options for the token omics. So it's really it's it's an interesting starting point. But I hope others, whether viewing this, see that there's a lot of space for experimentation."
"Speaker 2","00;52;42;27","00;53;19;16","Yeah, that's a great points. And yes, there's a tremendous amount of space for experimentation. And on that note, I want to emphasize that I'm thinking of this as kind of a prototype concept is just to generate ideas. Just to give an example, the goal of the, of the R&D program, if it were funded, is that it would it would evaluate and help to evaluate, evaluate, facilitate the evaluation of any number of designs and any number of design components that maybe are interchangeable or can be mixed or matched."
"Speaker 2","00;53;20;03","00;53;50;03","So this is just one concept, and I would hope that over a period of years, many concepts are are tested, you know, obviously tested first in simulations and in bench scale studies and things like that. And then if the ideas are really good, then also in field trials and real communities. Now, having said that, though, I do want to emphasize that, again, this is a science based, evidence driven program."
"Speaker 2","00;53;50;16","00;54;16;18","So so it's not just a question of, hey, what do you guys want to do? We want to do this and what do you guys want to do? What we want to do, this is where you actually have to show that your design is good or better than others or how it completion. Or at least describe how this design compares to another design in terms of the fitness metrics, in terms of fulfilling the purpose of a system."
"Speaker 2","00;54;17;00","00;54;44;15","So there's a general general agreed upon concept of system, fitness and system and fitness metrics how to there's a generally agreed upon path to assess a system. And then any design that is that is that is good relative to to the fitness metrics and in fulfilling its purpose, then, you know, this is, that's the idea. Like any conceivable design that improves fitness is a good one."
"Speaker 2","00;54;46;14","00;55;11;07","That's one point. Now, you also just on the currency, I wasn't actually going to talk about this, but the like you brought it up. So here we go. You I think you mentioned two kinds of currencies. One is kind of potentially a speculative currency like Bitcoin. Another is a currency backed by the say, the US dollar or something you know, like you have everyone has to put in a dollar and then they get a dollar out of local currency."
"Speaker 2","00;55;11;29","00;55;25;20","My concept for the leader is neither of those so the concept here is that the leader is is is there's a word for it. It's escaping me right now."
"Speaker 2","00;55;27;26","00;55;34;18","It is just simply created after this. It's an accounting system. So in the same crypto."
"Speaker 1","00;55;34;18","00;55;39;00","Thank you. Also crypto is by fiat too. It's by computational fiat."
"Speaker 2","00;55;39;27","00;56;05;12","Yeah. Yeah. So this is by no computation. No, this is just fiat by because we need more kirtan. We need more tokens. So this is an accounting system and obviously there's a limit to how much tokens you can create because the the concept here is that the token holds the value of about a dollar. So if you created 10 billion tokens and flooded the community on day one, the token would be worthless, right?"
"Speaker 2","00;56;05;13","00;56;31;08","It can only be created to the degree that it can be engaged with and employed in the circulation. It's all about security. And in particular, it's not speculative. So you cannot sell in the system. You cannot sell your tokens to anyone else. That's because I in this system, I wanted people to be you know, engaged. You know, this is like a voting system."
"Speaker 2","00;56;31;08","00;56;57;22","I wanted people to be engaged in the voting or community choices and it just wouldn't be right if I sold my votes to some other third party and gave them a whole bunch. That just would mean I can't entrust like in the CB's, for example, there might be a there might be a community organization that says like an investment group in a sense, a social investment group that says hey, we've been watching."
"Speaker 2","00;56;57;22","00;57;17;26","You know, we pay a lot of attention. We if we model the success of businesses and the needs of the community, and if you entrust tokens to us and dollars to us, we will choose good investments for them that we feel are best, you know, improve the community. Well, you can do that. That's fine. You know, that's all great."
"Speaker 2","00;57;18;03","00;57;40;13","But you can't sell your tokens to anybody and obviously then they're not backed by any resource color or otherwise. But that's just that's just this is on. And so as you said, you know, other designs would work differently and you could model out which ones improve the fitness of the community best, both current fitness and anticipated fitness all right."
"Speaker 2","00;57;40;13","00;57;41;21","That number, slide ten."
"Speaker 1","00;57;42;16","00;57;42;23","Yep."
"Speaker 2","00;57;45;12","00;58;16;21","So some additional notes as I as I said earlier, one of the aims of this of the simulation was to show a way, a logical way in which incomes can grow and equalize over time. But another way to say that is that a leader essentially pays people to become members. I mean, that's how the simulation works. If their income goes up by becoming a member, then they become a member well, you know, it's that's a that's a good selling point."
"Speaker 2","00;58;16;21","00;58;46;02","If if if if a leader has started up in my community and I realize that by joining in, my income goes up, well, you know, that's a good reason why why I might want to join and another thing is that we'll talk about three constructs. You know, that's kind of the machinery that makes this whole thing go. It's the income target the token share of income and the way teams will be describing it shortly here."
"Speaker 2","00;58;47;07","00;59;33;01","I already mentioned that a leader can create as many tokens as it can productively use limited by inflation concerns. The simulation goes for 28 years. The first 15 of that I term the growth period and this is when the number of participants in the community is rising. The number of tokens generated by the community is rising. The club itself the leader is expanding in all ways and after it reaches its its peak at about 15 years and as it turns out that's 90% of the local population end up joining the leader again because their income goes up and then the following years the 13 years following that are called the post growth period."
"Speaker 2","00;59;33;09","01;00;09;13","And that's just a equalization period where everything kind of settles out in time and enriches that kind of homeostasis point let's see here. Oh, and on the right with regards to the leader we can talk about family income pre and post for us, right? So, so if you're, if you need, if you're required to contribute a certain fraction of your income to the CFS, well then obviously your pre CBOs income will be higher than your possible CP income."
"Speaker 2","01;00;10;12","01;00;26;26","What I do when I do comparisons there, I'm really making comparisons on the post CFC income. So you can think of that as really pretax take home income all right. And one last thing to talk about. Oh, go ahead."
"Speaker 1","01;00;27;06","01;00;54;21","One funny note on that is depending on the governing tax body and how they regulate whether a certain kind of crypto transaction is taxable or not, every transaction of a token could be considered taxable. I'm not a lawyer, obviously, and this is the future but I'm just saying that depending on what kind of overarching tax structure exists, it could completely make or break this total structure for making it tax free to making it something that grinds to a halt."
"Speaker 2","01;00;56;08","01;01;15;15","Oh, have if if this was tax free, the token was tax free. If I could get income as tokens tax free, then this whole system is going to work like a charm. I would say I've designed it under the assumption that everyone will have to pay taxes on the tokens that they receive. So that's the more conservative assumption."
"Speaker 2","01;01;15;23","01;01;44;02","And it holds true. It will show how that's how it all works. But I do want to emphasize that this that, you know, the the kind of the structure of the leader and the way the CBA's works and the contributions to it and things like that, it's not dependent on the goodwill of members. These are the it's these all occur because this is the rules of the club."
"Speaker 2","01;01;44;02","01;02;08;01","So if you want to become a member, here are the rules. The rule is, you know, that, you know, there's a variety of rules that you follow and what some of those rules are in code, what your contributions to the CBS will be again once you put the money in there, then you get to choose you know, largely you get to choose how that money is spent all right."
"Speaker 2","01;02;08;05","01;02;48;15","Onto yep. So I mentioned that there's three constructs that sort of drive this whole thing. And the first is the income target. OK, I also mentioned that simulations would be available long before the first field trial ever, ever occurs. So in these simulations, as the entity that's being simulated would choose an income target. And that income target is a is a increasing level of family income up until up to a certain plateau levels up."
"Speaker 2","01;02;49;12","01;03;15;04","So that path, the expected path of that increase in income, family income is part of the design of the leader. And it's and different communities could choose slightly different functions or paths to get there. But that's the concept that that everyone knows in advance how we're going to get to this plateau level, how many years it'll take, at what rate works like that."
"Speaker 2","01;03;17;13","01;03;45;18","A second construct is the wage option and this is to address a certain problem. So for example, I belong, I'm in a family, my husband and wife team and I make a lot of money and my wife is not working. So as an example, well, then she could join the leader and be included in the not in the workforce group and she could get a high income just from being a member of the leader."
"Speaker 2","01;03;45;28","01;04;05;19","But I'm going to stay outside the leader because I'm making a ton of money anyway, and I don't need the leader. So the best choice for us would be I stay out of the leader. She joins the leader and our income goes up considerably because of that. But that would be a little bit of a free loading situation and would not be you know, it wouldn't be good for the lead as a whole."
"Speaker 2","01;04;05;19","01;04;38;06","So to prevent that kind of thing, there's two wage options. If our family income is having a sort of a is as this income target rises at any given year, if our income target is above it or if our income and working in some business, if our income is above the current year target, then then we choose wage option one and the and the club will give us a stipend, you know, above our normal income in tokens, a small stipend."
"Speaker 2","01;04;38;06","01;04;58;12","So we get a little bit of we're doing well, we have a lot of money because our income is high and we join and we get a small amount of tokens that we can play with in the CBA and stuff. On the other hand, if we our family has a low income lower than the target and we join, then we receive the whatever current your income target is."
"Speaker 2","01;04;58;12","01;05;34;01","So in the first year that might be low, but each year it increases monotonically. And by the time the simulation is over, everyone essentially is choosing this wage option number two and is receiving the it receiving the current year income target. And it's up it's a little bit about that. And then the I should say that the I that the set of families whose initial income is has is below the 90th percentile I consider those the target population."
"Speaker 2","01;05;34;09","01;06;06;25","And as we'll see, the leader increases incomes for 90% of the population and it's that 90% that joins the of them by the end of the simulation. And there's also a token share of income target as I target that is in any given year. How are the dollars and tokens you know was like if I'm going to purchase goods in my local community and local businesses how many tokens am I going to give relative to dollars."
"Speaker 2","01;06;07;13","01;06;14;20","That's also a design parameter OK. Slide 12."
"Speaker 1","01;06;16;14","01;06;32;19","One question is you mentioned just two person households where one person had a high income and one person didn't. And then you said it'd be free riding if one person joined and the other didn't. But what about one person wanting to join who doesn't have an income? I mean, where does that plan."
"Speaker 2","01;06;35;02","01;07;00;23","O of everything play into this simulation? Because for simplicity, I assume that everyone was in a two person family, obviously in a more sophisticated simulation you would have young adults that are single and so on, so that the simulation just doesn't have that level of sophistication. But I would argue, though, that I'm showing by the simulation the main concepts and that the main concepts make mathematical sense."
"Speaker 2","01;07;01;23","01;07;10;24","Oh, I don't think it would be all that difficult to have a bit more sophisticated simulation with there's actually one person families and things like that. But good point."
"Speaker 2","01;07;12;24","01;07;34;20","OK, so I'm going to in a moment, I'm going to show you some of the results of the simulation. And just just keep in mind that that's a simulation for 100,000 people and I'm using that for initial income values and income distribution. I'm using data, US census data for 2011 from four Lane County Oregon and from the US Census."
"Speaker 2","01;07;35;24","01;08;01;07","So that's that's how I'm making this know my realistic in part is I'm isn't I'm trying to mimic the distribution that was in Lane County Oregon in 2011 and then then that's to start with that you're zero and then every year it changes as it changes and if you never become a member then your income stays at that same level obviously not in not considering inflation in this model it's just a simple model."
"Speaker 2","01;08;01;07","01;08;30;21","And so we're kind of exceeding the concept of inflation for the moment. And it could be easily added in a more sophisticated simulation as far as other ways to make this semi realistic. I at the bottom of the left hand side there, I choose a tax rate that is a reasonable tax rate. There's a bunch of other parameters that I chose to be reasonable parameters of what I could, you know."
"Speaker 1","01;08;31;25","01;08;34;26","What's a reasonable tax rate? What's a reasonable tax rate?"
"Speaker 2","01;08;34;27","01;08;57;06","Oh, I chose four individuals. I chose 90% of adjusted gross income. Then everyone gets a 20 $500 deduction, know things like that. So like in the ballpark that's what I'm arguing is that these things are in the ballpark and again a more sophisticated simulation could look at a broken, you know, like a more complicated tax rate or something."
"Speaker 2","01;08;57;29","01;09;19;01","And I also look, for example, like, you know, what, what appears to be the average rate that people donate to nonprofits just in dollars, just regular. And, you know, I chose the percentage of income for that to things like that just to just to kind of get semi realistic. And it turns out that the simulation is not very sensitive to those parameters."
"Speaker 2","01;09;19;10","01;09;40;23","So they could be changed a bit. And the st the simulation should show the same results. Now, on the other hand, there are some token exchange system specific parameters and they definitely drive how this whole thing works. There's the some of them that I mentioned for the constructs, there's the formula as how, how in the income target rises every year."
"Speaker 2","01;09;41;17","01;10;04;26","That makes a big difference. And so with some of the others, the amount that people contribute to the service makes a difference. And so on. And speaking of amount, they contributed to the CBS. There's different kind of categories of the CBS. There's the nurture category, for example, the subsidy category, the loan category and so on. And there's what I call earmarks for all of those in the simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;10;04;27","01;10;30;14","Now, again, certain percent of income goes to subsidy group and CPA has 7% goes to in, certain percent goes to nurturing. Except I called it nurturing, by the way, is because that's what I would convey. The idea of the community is nurturing itself through this process, but it's providing votes to those people that wouldn't otherwise receive votes from that from their employer."
"Speaker 2","01;10;30;14","01;11;01;27","So again, money is a voting tool OK? All right. Initial employment rate is 7%, unemployment rate is 7%. And the initial fraction of employees who work in nonprofit organizations is about 7%. Now, when when a when a community say the leader existed and the community was getting together and kind of formed forming, to use a leader, they would have to make all kinds of decision decisions like what kind of income target function are we going to use?"
"Speaker 2","01;11;01;27","01;11;26;24","How many years do we think it'll take to reach our full capacity? There would be a whole bunch of decisions like that to make and one of them would be how many what kind of makeup of the makeup of the of the of the organizations. Do we want to should we all work for nonprofits? Like what if we what if 100 what if 90% of us, the membership actually work for a nonprofit?"
"Speaker 2","01;11;27;05","01;11;57;18","That's kind of an interesting question, you know, and I would argue that this will work. The community could choose like fairly extreme values, and she should work as long as the system continues to function as a cognitive system and as long as the community is using it to solve their actual problem. So if the community wanted to to have most everyone work in the nonprofit sector and one of the nonprofit sector to grow food for the community and provide services to community, it could do that."
"Speaker 2","01;11;57;22","01;12;33;04","I think it could do it if it if it instead wanted to fund principle businesses to a large degree, and nonprofits in smaller degrees could do that. So this again, this is this decision making process is a way for us, for a community to decide what it wants to be, what flavor it wants its economy to be, where where it wants its individuals to work like you know, being a member of a community like this, I would want to choose jobs that I that are useful to me and to others and that I would want to work in, you know, like whatever, whatever those would be."
"Speaker 2","01;12;33;23","01;13;02;10","But an interesting thing, though, is if a community chose to fund a large part of its workforce in nonprofit sectors, it could have say, you know, a large number of biologists out repairing forests and street and streams. And, you know, it could have a lot of forest workers doing repairing things. There could be a substantial amount of ecological regional variation funded from this but there could be other things."
"Speaker 2","01;13;02;10","01;13;31;26","It's whatever the community feels is going to increase its fitness, you know, its its capacity, its wellbeing, its quality of life. The community can choose not only which jobs to fund, but what kinds of jobs, what kinds of organizations all right. Right on to the next slide. 13. So this is where the simulation occurs and it goes in an annual steps and it each in each sort of each year."
"Speaker 2","01;13;32;04","01;14;00;19","The first step as new members are added and according to this, expected participation rate and and some of those people who are already working in what I call leader funded new jobs and that is you know the leader funds and organization. But that organization might go bust and then those people would lose their leader funded new jobs and they switch over then to the to the unemployed or another workforce category."
"Speaker 2","01;14;02;02","01;14;30;14","So number two, every year some people lose their job. Some members lose their jobs. Uh, the, the number three, the CVS makes nurture payments to those people who are not in the workforce or unemployed. Uh, I'm just going to, I'm not going to go through each of these, but I will mention number five. So the leader has injected tokens into the economy."
"Speaker 2","01;14;30;26","01;15;00;08","You can't pay taxes with tokens. So so by definition, these dollars have to come from elsewhere. Another factor is that in a poor community, it may have a shortage of dollars relative to the rest of the world. Other other areas in the country might have a higher percentage of dollars in circulation. So somehow this club, this leader has to pick up dollars from elsewhere in order to fund it."
"Speaker 2","01;15;00;09","01;15;40;15","So in order to achieve the level of income that it's aiming to achieve and it does that by one main one main process, and that's by having a kind of a sophisticated buy local program. That is it's the community is supporting the local businesses and spending a good chunk of its of its resources in the local businesses. And then by definition, that money is not flowing out of the community and staying in the community longer."
"Speaker 2","01;15;40;15","01;16;03;04","It's circulated in the community longer. And it the community obtains dollars from elsewhere by by having it by adjusting its trade balance with the rest of the world. So one of the one of the the the this this statistics that the community would be tracking is what is our trade balance with the rest of the world? How are we doing?"
"Speaker 2","01;16;03;04","01;16;29;29","Are we are we adjusting our trade balance as necessary to bring in the dollars that we want? And in the simulation, as you'll see that the the the the families, the families actually reach a what would be considered very high income from this the 90th 90th percentile of starting income. So the families would receive quite a very high income and that would include tokens and dollars."
"Speaker 2","01;16;30;15","01;16;58;13","And as turns out, the dollar portion of that is about the national average. If you looked at all incomes in the US, that community ends up in a sense obtaining its fair share of dollars. So if every community in the country were to do this, there wouldn't be a shortage of dollars because those dollars would just be more equally dispersed everywhere and that's kind of important."
"Speaker 2","01;16;58;13","01;17;20;25","You wouldn't what you would not want to do in our program is design a system so that a small community can do exceptionally well at the expense of everybody else. So that's that's not what this is so number five was that you would adjust the trade balance as part of these steps every year. And again, this is a very simple simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;17;20;25","01;17;44;03","So at the end of each year, all the individuals spend whatever has gone into the CPF, US or to taxes or other purposes like that. They spend that in local organizations and finally, number seven, individuals make the pay taxes to governments in dollars. Yep. So that's it. So that's kind of the steps you get there. That's how it sort of works mechanically."
"Speaker 2","01;17;44;17","01;18;13;27","Here's some of the parameters that are used over on the left are the kind of general parameters that excuse me, those are the targets for that for the community. So the income targets both starting and ending values. And this is for the growth period, which is a 15 year period. So the income target starts low at the essentially at a like a what would, might be called a minimum wage, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;18;14;15","01;18;44;27","And then it rises up to over almost 110,000 tokens in dollars. So 110,000 family income and currency and that is the 90th percentile of starting college. So by the way, I've already said that every year that the club essentially pays people to join. So obviously in year one it's not asking anyone to reduce their income down to the minimum wage."
"Speaker 2","01;18;44;27","01;19;07;29","Right. So no one is asked to, to lose income in this. The people join because their income increases. Now some people might join because they just want to be a part of the community, part of the leader and their income would join. Their income would increase too, if they're above the income target. But there their income would increase by a small stipend paid and target."
"Speaker 2","01;19;08;01","01;19;15;12","So even if I'm making $1,000,000, I can join and I can receive some tokens and then I can participate in CPRS and other things like that."
"Speaker 2","01;19;18;26","01;19;40;19","So that was the table on the left. And the table on the right are some of the earmarks that I use in this particular simulation. And you might notice that the highest earmark there is for the near term. So a good a good chunk of my kind of raw revenue come in my raw income, a good chunk of that, almost 40% is going to the nurturer of the Cbus."
"Speaker 2","01;19;41;02","01;20;21;24","And that's pain again for anyone who's unemployed or out of the workforce and other than that, some of my income goes to the lending arm, some goes to principal businesses and goes to nonprofits, it goes to subsidies of various kinds, goes to donations for nonprofits and and so on. And I also have obviously, if I'm putting money into this lending function, then I'm building up a kind of a savings account in the CPF that that if people are paying back my loans then every year and maintaining a good chunk of money in itself, kind of like a savings account I think."
"Speaker 2","01;20;22;08","01;20;48;02","Yeah, that's about it to them. There's a couple of rules of thumb that I realized in trying to find parameters that actually make this thing go. And the one rule of thumb is the nurture arm has to have a high enough ear work so that that actually functions as, as it's supposed to. And it also the donations earmark for local nonprofits has to be high enough so that any nonprofit that I fund can actually pay its employees."
"Speaker 2","01;20;48;04","01;21;14;28","The, the, the, the the income target, at least the income target by the way, the principal business, one of the, one of the things that the marks on the principal business is that it pays no higher than the final income target. So the final target is about 107,000 token and dollar tokens and dollars. And a principal of business would never pay someone more than that."
"Speaker 2","01;21;15;17","01;21;40;15","And ideally, most people who join a principal business would become members, and I think they all would become members and participate in the leader itself. So so that's that's a few things that distinguish a principal business. And obviously a community would want to fund principal businesses because this is a business model that is designed to support the leader and the club model itself."
"Speaker 2","01;21;40;15","01;22;09;17","So it's designed to support the community and if I were voting in the CBA first, I would really, you know, like I value being a member, I value my community and I want my I want this thing to work and I want I want to receive the benefits that this system is promising. And and the way to get there or one way to get there is to mostly fund the principal businesses so that they are serving the community in the way kind of like a nonprofit serves as a community."
"Speaker 2","01;22;10;20","01;22;36;18","And and they're paying wages that are consistent with how this whole thing works. And they're really being responsible to the community via this business model. And it's really in my best interest to support principal businesses with, you know, subsidies and donations and loans and things like that. Not that not that there is no room for for not for, you know, regular businesses."
"Speaker 2","01;22;36;27","01;22;46;07","There is you can fund those, too. But by and large, you want to put a little extra emphasis on principal businesses all right."
"Speaker 2","01;22;50;27","01;23;12;16","Yeah, that's it for parameters. Next slide now we're going to start looking at what actually happens we have about 20 about 35 minutes left. I think what we're going to get right through the end of this. So I may have to go a little faster as we as we get to the end. So the first slide on the upper left is the fraction of the company population."
"Speaker 2","01;23;12;25","01;23;37;27","And you can see in that blue line, that's the that's the the the rate at which people the participation rate which is decided at advance. You know, this is what we expect to happen. And there goes straight up and and then it reaches the plateau after 15 years. So that's after 15 years. 90% of the population has joined the leader and they've done so because their income has gone up."
"Speaker 2","01;23;38;14","01;24;14;04","And that if I were, if I were, if I were a member, a citizen in the county and I didn't have a job, well for sure I would want to join the leader because I want to get my income is going to go way up if I join leader relative to not join in the leader. So I account here for every not every unemployed person or not an workforce person to, to, to actually join the leader so they can be part of the, you know, receive funding from the near term of the CVS down below that, there's the income target the in and target the blue line."
"Speaker 2","01;24;14;04","01;24;41;16","Again, after 15 years, it reaches a plateau of about $110,000 and then levels off. And again, I want to emphasize that at that level every community in the country could do this. This does not preclude the sort of if if one community does it that doesn't mean that others can't every community could achieve these levels, you know based on the assumptions of the model on the right is the fraction of income over the years."
"Speaker 2","01;24;41;16","01;25;12;17","So fraction and let's just look at the at the green line. The green dotted line is the token share of income target. So in the early years, that's very low fraction. Most of the income is in dollars and that it raises over it rises over the years to eventually reach about 35%. So at the end of the simulation, about 35% of income is in tokens and the rest is not and then the fun starts with the bottom right scrap."
"Speaker 2","01;25;12;27","01;25;43;12","This says the average family income starts at about 40,000 that is you know from this from the census data it starts at about 40,000. And you can see what happens with the blue line over the period of 15 years it more than doubles so family income more than couples that reaches the 90th percentile of starting income. The red dotted line is showing the similar thing all it's including the money that people have in their savings account in the in the CVACs."
"Speaker 2","01;25;43;12","01;26;23;09","So there's a two person family each is contributed the maximum of 30,000 to the savings account. So on top of this high income families also have $60,000 in savings in the in the siblings you might notice that you know the the the all the growth is happening during the first 15 years but you can tell from the blue line the family income line at the bottom graph that there's a little bit of a lag, it takes a little bit of time for the whole thing to actually reach its maximum family income and that happens about 28 years of work."
"Speaker 2","01;26;24;06","01;26;44;12","I might also mention too that these I'm just trying to in this simulation I was just trying to find kind of reasonable parameters and a growth period and things like that such that it would all make sense and would work and we're not asking that we're not expecting the community to change. You know, in year one suddenly everything changes."
"Speaker 2","01;26;44;12","01;27;11;18","It wouldn't be like that. It would tend to grow slower. But having said that, you can think of the simulation is what might happen in the first leader. But imagine that there's a ready 100 leaders or 200 or 500 leaders around. It's really clear how these things work. There's lots of data coming in from leaders all over. It's clear that incomes are rising and the interest by the general population is growing very rapidly."
"Speaker 2","01;27;12;03","01;27;37;12","Like suddenly it's the new thing and everyone wants to join because everyone's income goes up and their empowerment goes up and their sense of community goes up and there and they're lining their purpose with, you know, some greater good. It's, it feels good. You know, there's a whole variety of benefits that come from being a member. So so now a new so someone wants to start a club in another city and suddenly there's a tremendous interest on day one."
"Speaker 2","01;27;37;12","01;28;06;19","Well, then all of this would go a lot faster. It wouldn't necessarily take 15 years, it might go in half that time or whatever On slide 16 on the left is the unemployment rate. As I mentioned, it starts at about 7% in the county. And you can see that after about 15 years, the county achieves full employment. So that all works well."
"Speaker 2","01;28;06;19","01;28;25;28","The lead is generating jobs and whether they're nonprofit jobs in the nonprofit sector or for profit sector, the unemployment rate, everyone's been engaged. That wants to be engaged now. But keep in mind that a certain percent stay out of the workforce and that just shows a typical percent, whatever that was. 36% or something. So not everyone is working."
"Speaker 2","01;28;25;28","01;28;49;15","Some people are doing other things, non formal jobs or whatever term you might want to use that, you know, everyone's engaged somehow. People are actively engaged in their lives and in their community. But some people who are in the workforce the moment is very low and the unemployment rate in the club itself reaches its lowest level after ten years."
"Speaker 2","01;28;49;15","01;29;12;11","It just takes a little while for the rest of the county to catch up. On the left. This is this is the before and after snapshot of what family incomes are but the upper graph shows the distribution from the census data on day one or day zero. And the bottom graph shows the same thing on the 28th year of the simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;29;12;21","01;29;32;25","And you can see that essentially everyone in the county, 90% of the people in the county are making the income target, which is just over 100,000. So so it goes from a highly unequal income to a almost completely equal income over the period of 28 years."
"Speaker 1","01;29;35;09","01;29;49;13","Let me, let me ask the question John. So I still see that between 350 and 400 there's still the 10% who don't join ostensibly because they would stand to those goals. Right. So how do you take this group."
"Speaker 2","01;29;49;25","01;29;51;07","They don't, they wouldn't join big."
"Speaker 1","01;29;52;27","01;30;07;29","Oh sorry. Just how do you take the other 90% and make their average value something with fewer people working productive jobs having a higher average than 80% that's below 100 K in the top graph."
"Speaker 2","01;30;12;03","01;30;24;14","If I understood the question it's kind of what do you do with the nine with a 10% who don't join and do is there some kind of do their income somehow equalize over time or no like what happens."
"Speaker 1","01;30;24;27","01;30;50;16","Well let me just ask again because they don't change so ignoring the 10% whose income does not change how do you take the belt the bell curve you know right side here which has an average below 100,000 and then by reducing the variance also increase the mean while potentially having fewer people with income generating jobs. Just how does the extra USD per year come into this system."
"Speaker 2","01;30;55;00","01;31;29;13","OK and again I'm not sure if I understand the question, but how does the extra USDA US dollars come into the system? That's true. Balancing of the trade deficit. So that's how that new dollars come in that weren't there before. Right? So what, what, what this club is doing essentially is adjusting its trade balance with the rest of the world such that it's getting its fair share of dollars and the dollar income of the club equals the average dollar income of the of the US at the end of the simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;31;31;06","01;31;32;14","Did that answer your question."
"Speaker 1","01;31;34;24","01;32;01;17","So it's predicated on basically locally positive economy that's generating a trade excess to get more USD because you need more USD to pay that number of people 100,000 versus between zero and a hundred thousand. And so even though fewer are making potentially productive jobs, fewer are not in the workforce, there's so many more USD coming in that we can raise the income for them and everyone else."
"Speaker 1","01;32;01;17","01;32;03;15","I'm just saying that that that's built in right."
"Speaker 2","01;32;04;07","01;32;21;24","That's built in. Yep. That's all about it. Yep. Yep. Now you're not what I thought you were originally asking is what do you do with the other 10%? What happens to them we'll talk about that in a moment. But I'm going to argue that their incomes actually fall towards this, this plateau of around 210 two."
"Speaker 1","01;32;22;14","01;32;25;08","And I think social pressure and social pressure would."
"Speaker 2","01;32;25;08","01;32;49;13","Ensure that that would be one, that would be one thing. And there's some other reasons to well we might as well talk about it now since we're on the topic. So so whose so so let's suppose that I own this some corporate I own a franchise of a corporate and let's say McDonald's or something could be anything. And I'm, you know, I take in money from the local community."
"Speaker 2","01;32;49;13","01;33;09;22","They spend money to buy my food, but then I'm sending money outside of the community because I'm paying, you know, franchise fees and other things, corporate fees and other things. So some of my money's leaving the community. I'm paying low wage workers. And that's what makes this whole model work, is that I can get low wage workers to, you know, sit behind the counter and make hamburgers or whatever."
"Speaker 2","01;33;10;19","01;33;35;07","Now, what happens when there's no low wage workers to choose from? Like everyone's joined later, everyone who I would have paid 30,000 a year or 40,000 a year is now making 110,000 here. Where does my workforce come from? How is my business model going to even function if I don't have a low, low income pool to draw from so I'm going to my business model is going to be strained to say the least."
"Speaker 2","01;33;35;20","01;34;04;17","It won't work very well. It's changing the game or it's changing the foundations of how the normal business works in the world. So not only not only would people not be relevant because because the leader would be paying higher incomes, higher wages, but but those people should be enjoying their jobs a whole lot more. They would be they would understand that they're helping the community by working in the bakery or wherever they're working."
"Speaker 2","01;34;04;18","01;34;22;21","It's part of a community effort to raise the fitness of the community. Right. Like we're all in this together and it's and it's and I'm getting a voice of decision making by becoming a member. So there's lots of reasons I would want to be a member and very few reasons I would want to be a low paid worker at McDonald's or anywhere else."
"Speaker 2","01;34;24;00","01;34;49;19","And that's that's another reason. And the third reason is there's the IP, the commons that I mentioned earlier. And so there's all these you know, the leader has now funded all these new businesses. Some are technical businesses, some other businesses. But there's all kinds of property being generated, in particular intellectual property that that is shared among the membership among the club and maybe even between clubs."
"Speaker 2","01;34;50;10","01;35;18;25","So suddenly there's this enormous advantage to to principal business or to a to a member businesses to becoming members, because you get this, you know, this volume of free intellectual property and standard businesses that are outside of this do not have access to that. You know, they have to pay pay royalties to get that, you know, IP stuff."
"Speaker 2","01;35;19;11","01;35;26;25","So that's another reason. And I think there's actually still one more reason that I can that I had heard. I want to talk about."
"Speaker 1","01;35;28;18","01;35;29;17","Well, a successful."
"Speaker 2","01;35;29;28","01;35;30;13","Come to me."
"Speaker 1","01;35;31;21","01;35;52;13","A successful community would have many leverage points and many ways to draw income in and an unsuccessful community would have no one wanting to help them except for the U.S. government paying USD, which I also saw in the model right. That the USD is providing by the government. So it's like welfare at the country level and also at the community level."
"Speaker 2","01;35;53;07","01;36;17;16","Yeah. Yeah. So imagine that's a good point and imagine that's effect, say a county. You go over the county level governance or state level governance or even federal governance what if it didn't have to pay it like all this unemployment insurance and all these other things, the fees that the government has to pay, you know, when people are when people need help, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;36;17;17","01;36;45;02","Well, these programs and the and all of it is being taken care of at the community level by by leaders and clubs like leaders. So the so there would be actually like in that sense, you would expect that local, state and national governments might actually like this concept. You know, because it's reducing their liabilities, you know, and especially at the local government, the local as I said, the local tax revenues are double in this in this simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;36;45;02","01;37;06;08","So, you know, the county government might go like, hey, good idea. This is this could work. This is a great idea. And the individuals might say, hey, this works. This is a great idea. I'm on it. My income is going to double. Great. Fantastic. Just a bit of an income. Obviously, with this, the lower your starting income the more you benefit from that."
"Speaker 2","01;37;06;08","01;37;29;28","So if you happen to be someone that they zero where your family income is fairly low, your IRS's is going to have the greatest rise compared to someone who's already making a mid-level income or something. But it doesn't matter. It is like the rising boat catches everybody by the time it gets up to the up to the plateau after 15 years similar results on slide 17."
"Speaker 2","01;37;31;08","01;38;04;17","On the upper left hand corner, you can see how much money is circulating in this CVS. And I want to emphasize again and that this is a community 100,000 people. This is a small community, right? So this small community is now circulating 6 billion in currency annually. That's 6 billion that it has to choose about like what jobs to Ukraine what what nonprofits do we support what do we want what kind of parks do we want?"
"Speaker 2","01;38;04;17","01;38;24;13","What is road quality? How is our hospital system? Whatever decisions this community needs to make, it's got 6 billion and currency to play with. So an enormous amount and that should be enough for the community to make whatever choices it wants. As far as what are we going to do? How are we going to get there? Are we going to improve our quality of life?"
"Speaker 2","01;38;29;06","01;39;00;28","And maybe just off the note I will mention again, we've already said this, but there's no club that's a that's an entity in and of itself as clubs start to form and and develop, that would also be along with the networks of clubs that are forming and developing that are also a cognitive system. So the cognitive system is playing that cognitive architecture is playing out at the local level at a club, and it's playing out between clubs as clubs need to make decisions about how they're going to solve larger problems."
"Speaker 2","01;39;00;28","01;39;12;24","Right. So so again, no club is in this for its own good and only its own good. There's this is a, you know, clubs are connected. This is a greater good project."
"Speaker 2","01;39;14;26","01;39;49;19","The bottom left, these are how the workforce gets divided over time. So on day zero, so most of the workforce is in the regular state businesses almost 1990 7% is in the regular standard business. A little bit is in the nonprofit sector and obviously zero is in the principal business sector. But after after the period of 28 years that achieve some different amounts of the workforce and I just want to say again that whatever balance there is, it's a balance that the community chooses in advance, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;39;49;19","01;40;20;20","So it just didn't play out by itself. These are based on these are all based on community decisions all along the way. Like we want this community wants to achieve a 50% split its workforce 50% into the nonprofit sector or 40% or 80% or 90% or whatever it wants upper right draft or the donations made to nonprofits. These are dollar donations apart from the CVS and just using a like a fraction of income goes to donations like a general fraction."
"Speaker 2","01;40;21;02","01;40;42;21","And you can see that donations to local nonprofits more than double. So you know this at least in theory this whole system is like a boon for county governments. It's a boon for the nonprofit sector, it's a boon for the education sector. And then everyone else's income is going up and unemployment's going down too. So like who loses?"
"Speaker 2","01;40;42;28","01;41;02;12","The only people that are losing from this whole thing are the people who hold hold enormous economic power on day zero. You know, like those people aren't really gaining from this. And if lots and lots of clubs were too, you know, lots and lots of cities were to implement clubs and this actually happened in scale, you know, distributed to scale."
"Speaker 2","01;41;02;28","01;41;27;10","Then the real losers in a sense would be those who are, of quite, you know, quite wealthy to begin with, like billionaires or multimillionaires, because their income, their incomes would probably drop as I've mentioned over time only because of social pressures and because they can't get people to work in their businesses and things like that. But at the same time, everyone's well-being increases."
"Speaker 2","01;41;27;10","01;41;56;10","So it's not like anyone loses. Everyone wins here like the truth. The world is, you know, all communities are more empowered to solve their real problems that matter. This is a cognitive system aimed at achieving sustainability and thriving into the future. So there really isn't anybody that loses from this. There's just some apparent losers, you know, and not very many of them at that the lower graph on this, I won't say too much."
"Speaker 2","01;41;56;10","01;42;17;18","I'll just explain the blue line there. This is the number of tokens that are generated by the community. So obviously in the early years here, for the first 15 years, you're generating tokens because you grow in in this growth period. And then after that you have a the tokens are just circulated and importantly, they don't circulate outside of the membership."
"Speaker 2","01;42;17;18","01;42;44;18","So if I'm a standard business, there's no one can say, oh, that's the other reason why why my clubs would and club businesses would grow is that if you're not a part of the club, people can't spend their tokens at your establishment. So I might be a local business and I don't want to participate. That's fine. If all goes as it goes, but everyone else's incomes are increasing."
"Speaker 2","01;42;44;18","01;42;54;12","Part of that income is in tokens and those people can't spend their tokens. At my establishment, the only way they can is if I join the buy, join the club, then they can spend their tokens at my establishment."
"Speaker 2","01;42;58;00","01;43;22;12","Uh, page 18. And I think this is the last of the results I was going to show. This is the results just for the local government. This is tax revenues for the local government. The red is the tax receipts. So for this for this Lane County guys, estimated that it starts at about $1,000,000,000 annually in revenues and more than doubles by the end of the simulation."
"Speaker 2","01;43;22;12","01;43;40;00","So their tax revenues go way up. And you can imagine what counties would want to do with their revenues. Tax revenues double as you can imagine. They could put that to very good use uh, OK. And just some final remarks on these last two slides."
"Speaker 2","01;43;42;04","01;44;19;29","And this this first one is something that we just we're touching on what happens to the other 90% that don't join the leader. So I would argue that in the long run, even that 10% that has very high incomes would see their incomes move closer to the two, the income of the the target income for the leaders and that's for all the reasons that we just said that that business owners don't receive the benefit of tokens because they can't accept tokens of their social pressures to belong to the club because it's in everyone's benefit for people to belong to the club."
"Speaker 2","01;44;20;15","01;44;42;05","And so the IP is there's no put by people that people have access to if they join the club. And so like a number of reasons, maybe there was one other we talked about so you would think that, you know, this is the new, you know, like if this is happening, then it's that it's like who who uses a typewriter anymore, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;44;42;18","01;45;05;23","Hardly anybody. It's because computers work better for typesetting, you know, this is technology. Yeah. That's another way to say that this is a technology. This is a decision making technology. And it's both a soft and a hard technology. Education is part of it. There's, you know, there's all these components to it, but it's technology. And, you know, that's what happens in the world."
"Speaker 2","01;45;05;23","01;45;12;14","A new technology springs up. It's it's far better than the old one. And then suddenly the old one is toast."
"Speaker 1","01;45;13;23","01;45;36;07","Well, the old one assumes into conflict at a higher level. So you could have different chains that are competing. So the idea that still one part for me is that just thinking about evolutionary transitions and individuality, it raises the level of conflict to another level up from what we've seen before with everything that politically and game theoretically would come with that."
"Speaker 1","01;45;36;15","01;46;03;02","And the second piece is I don't update my priors based upon models without parameter sweeps. So it's hard to look at a given layout and imagined, but it's something that we actually use as a North Star for people who are on that political journey. They might see that as beneficial. But as you're pointing out, people who don't see it as beneficial are not going to join until the incentive structures are restructured for them or that will happen."
"Speaker 2","01;46;03;22","01;46;23;22","Yeah, absolutely. And everyone's learning from this so you know, the communities, the world is learning from this, right? And the world is learning over time. Whether this is even a better idea or not is this whole system work? And obviously, if it doesn't work, if it doesn't produce these benefits that are that are that are expected in advance, if it doesn't do that, then it doesn't work."
"Speaker 2","01;46;23;22","01;46;47;28","And then no one would join because it's a stupid system. Right. Or has flaws that need to be fixed or something. So, yeah, everyone's learning together and and there could be numerous trials going on of different systems at the same time. And, you know, try it for the world. Everyone can be trying to figure out what works best in this, what kind of systems work best and yeah, all of that's happening."
"Speaker 2","01;46;47;29","01;47;13;19","It's evolving as, as we go. It's evolving. But the important thing is, is that this is a framework to facilitate societal cognition you know, at the local level, at the club level. And if we think of our societal systems as cognitive systems, then it's appropriately reasonable question to ask what kinds of system designs work best? And that's what this whole R&D program is aimed at."
"Speaker 2","01;47;13;19","01;47;41;23","Just asking the question of all conceivable zones, which kinds of the designs might most facilitate total cognition and therefore achieve the intrinsic purpose of a of a society which is to thrive now and in the future. So what this means and you can imagine all kinds of trials to get to help answer that question next slide and this is the last one, just a few remarks."
"Speaker 2","01;47;41;25","01;48;02;11","I've touched on this already, but but an organism is agile, right? Like I have, among other things, I have legs. I can run from danger. I can do things, I can change my behavior as the community. We can we can change our behaviors. We can we can do whatever we need to do to achieve whatever task is in front of us, or at least achieve most tasks."
"Speaker 2","01;48;03;00","01;48;25;03","But in particular, a leader is agile like it is flexible. It can choose what jobs it funds. And suppose that, you know, ten years into a into a new club, some big thing happens or some new challenge that wasn't anticipated. It just arose. Well, this is decision making under uncertainty. That's the whole concept of this. Like this whole system facilitates decision making under uncertainty."
"Speaker 2","01;48;25;12","01;48;52;14","Something new has happened. Now it has to the community has to respond to this new set of conditions. It can change its makeup of what businesses it funds, what organizations it funds, who does what it can you know, it can change the how many people work in the nonprofit sector versus for profit sector. It can essentially use it can vote to to focus its attention and its resources, human and otherwise, on whatever problem it needs to focus its attention on."
"Speaker 2","01;48;52;14","01;49;16;12","So it's agile by design and part of that, by the way, is is having fairly equal income. So in our native system, if I'm a billionaire, it is really hard for the society to allocate my billions of dollars for some worthwhile project. Right. Because because of the, you know, the private property laws that's my private property and you can't use it."
"Speaker 2","01;49;16;12","01;49;54;11","Right. But if everyone's income is equal, then then everyone is participating in that redistribution of attention and resources to whatever problem is important to the community. So a community empowers businesses with with funding for example, and it's important that it can retract that support when necessary. So the the design of this whole system is such that there that things can change rapidly if need be, and the community can redirect its attention to whatever problem it needs to address again."
"Speaker 2","01;49;54;21","01;50;28;18","The next one there is that the main resource is not money, it's human, it's human attention and energy. And also, to some degree, natural resources. But the real purpose of money is simply to to allocate human attention and human energy and resources into those problems that actually matter. And then lastly, again, the leader can because of its agility, because the members are choosing what kinds of jobs to make, what what sorts of businesses, what sorts of right, what sorts of the autonomy it wants."
"Speaker 2","01;50;28;18","01;50;45;04","It can choose any flavor of an economy it wants. It creates the jobs that it wants to work in and the kinds of jobs that the people want the children to work in so it can do whatever it wants, as long as it functions as a cognitive system and as long as it actually meets the essential needs of the organism of the community."
"Speaker 2","01;50;46;06","01;50;54;07","And that is it little or not in a nutshell, that's it. Then those long distance orphans."
"Speaker 1","01;50;54;29","01;51;29;25","There's the the blueprint haiku for The Nutcracker it is a few levels upstream, but that's why it's fun to have these open ended discussions and just allow what you've worked on for so long. To flow out here, how you're laying it out. And maybe in closing out this little discussion as we head into the next two weeks with the group discussions how would somebody get involved or where can somebody come into play after seeing this or reading the papers or Oh."
"Speaker 2","01;51;30;07","01;51;55;15","Well, I can be reached through the website Principal Societies Project Dot org, and there's there's other resources there. So, you know, one start would be just to familiarize yourself with the material a bit. But we have a mailing list so people can just join the mailing list. And as things, progressions, opportunities, arise, then we can choose, you know, we can use our mailing list to contact people at this hour."
"Speaker 2","01;51;55;15","01;52;31;01","This whole series is written to the scientific community so that's, that's my target audience for the series of papers. And I'm hoping that the I'm hoping that I can entice the scientific community to pick up this topic as a worthwhile topic. Of study and endeavor. You know, can we, can we as a, as a scientific community address these issues so we create designs, test designs, identify fitness metrics for a community, you know, describe how community cognition works and what is how it works best and the conditions necessary."
"Speaker 2","01;52;32;05","01;52;59;19","Are we are we ready to to pick up this topic? And I'm hoping the answer is yes, because let's looks rich to me and on so many levels could be extremely valuable to society. And obviously it's aimed at societal transformation and it's already quite clear that that different groups, academic and otherwise generally understand that bold change is necessary so this is one form of bold change."
"Speaker 2","01;53;00;05","01;53;45;14","Now, academics in particular, please do reach out if you think there's any number, if you have some funding there's any number of small studies that could be done immediately and this simulation could be expanded in a number of ways. A study could be done just looking at just asking the public what they think of deep transformation and what they would think of of income equality or what the, you know, like laying out some possibilities to the public or if you were in media, whether that's literature or music or movies or documentaries or whatever, please contact me because just getting the word out to the public, that transformation in this sense might actually be viable and"
"Speaker 2","01;53;45;14","01;54;05;02","possible. That's like half the battle is just to say, we can do this. There's a way we can do this. This is open to us if we choose to take it and so that's important. And so if you've got any idea about how to what you've no idea of how to contribute to this effort, then great. You know, some, you know."
"Speaker 1","01;54;07;16","01;54;30;10","It's like either they can read it now and send you a note or hear about it later or not. So. Right, right. Goes John, thanks so much for these awesome sessions, though, because it was great reading the papers and great to go through them again and we'll all be looking forward to speaking with you on the upcoming Tuesdays at 7 a.m. Pacific."
"Speaker 1","01;54;30;24","01;54;31;27","So we'll talk to you soon."
"Speaker 2","01;54;32;07","01;54;36;09","Right. I really appreciate the opportunity absolutely."
"Speaker 1","01;54;36;09","01;54;52;24","John, talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you. Absolutely, John. Talk to you.
